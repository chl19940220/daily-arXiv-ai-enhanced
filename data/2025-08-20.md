### [1] [YOLO11-CR: a Lightweight Convolution-and-Attention Framework for Accurate Fatigue Driving Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13205)
*Zhebin Jin,Ligang Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: YOLO11-CR是一个轻量级实时疲劳检测模型，通过CAFM和RCM模块提升特征表达和空间定位能力，在DSM数据集上表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有疲劳检测方法存在侵入性、硬件依赖或小目标检测困难等问题，需要开发非侵入式、鲁棒性强的实时检测方案

Method: 提出YOLO11-CR模型，包含卷积注意力融合模块(CAFM)整合CNN局部特征和Transformer全局上下文，以及矩形校准模块(RCM)捕获水平和垂直上下文信息

Result: 在DSM数据集上达到87.17%精确率、83.86%召回率、88.09% mAP@50和55.93% mAP@50-95，显著优于基线模型

Conclusion: YOLO11-CR为车载疲劳监控提供了实用高效解决方案，具有实际部署潜力，未来可扩展时间建模和多模态数据集成

Abstract: Driver fatigue detection is of paramount importance for intelligent
transportation systems due to its critical role in mitigating road traffic
accidents. While physiological and vehicle dynamics-based methods offer
accuracy, they are often intrusive, hardware-dependent, and lack robustness in
real-world environments. Vision-based techniques provide a non-intrusive and
scalable alternative, but still face challenges such as poor detection of small
or occluded objects and limited multi-scale feature modeling. To address these
issues, this paper proposes YOLO11-CR, a lightweight and efficient object
detection model tailored for real-time fatigue detection. YOLO11-CR introduces
two key modules: the Convolution-and-Attention Fusion Module (CAFM), which
integrates local CNN features with global Transformer-based context to enhance
feature expressiveness; and the Rectangular Calibration Module (RCM), which
captures horizontal and vertical contextual information to improve spatial
localization, particularly for profile faces and small objects like mobile
phones. Experiments on the DSM dataset demonstrated that YOLO11-CR achieves a
precision of 87.17%, recall of 83.86%, mAP@50 of 88.09%, and mAP@50-95 of
55.93%, outperforming baseline models significantly. Ablation studies further
validate the effectiveness of the CAFM and RCM modules in improving both
sensitivity and localization accuracy. These results demonstrate that YOLO11-CR
offers a practical and high-performing solution for in-vehicle fatigue
monitoring, with strong potential for real-world deployment and future
enhancements involving temporal modeling, multi-modal data integration, and
embedded optimization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Mirage基准测试和Mirage-R1模型，用于检测真实世界中的AI生成图像，相比现有方法在基准测试上提升5-10%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AI生成图像检测器在实验室环境下有效，但无法泛化到真实世界的嘈杂场景，这些图像可能来自多个生成模型并经过后期编辑

Method: 构建Mirage基准测试，包含互联网来源和合成数据集；开发Mirage-R1视觉语言模型，采用启发式到分析式推理机制，通过监督微调和强化学习两阶段训练，并使用推理时自适应思考策略

Result: 在Mirage基准和公共基准上分别领先最先进检测器5%和10%

Conclusion: Mirage基准和Mirage-R1模型有效解决了真实世界AI生成图像检测的挑战，在性能和推理速度之间取得了良好平衡

Abstract: The spreading of AI-generated images (AIGI), driven by advances in generative
AI, poses a significant threat to information security and public trust.
Existing AIGI detectors, while effective against images in clean laboratory
settings, fail to generalize to in-the-wild scenarios. These real-world images
are noisy, varying from ``obviously fake" images to realistic ones derived from
multiple generative models and further edited for quality control. We address
in-the-wild AIGI detection in this paper. We introduce Mirage, a challenging
benchmark designed to emulate the complexity of in-the-wild AIGI. Mirage is
constructed from two sources: (1) a large corpus of Internet-sourced AIGI
verified by human experts, and (2) a synthesized dataset created through the
collaboration between multiple expert generators, closely simulating the
realistic AIGI in the wild. Building on this benchmark, we propose Mirage-R1, a
vision-language model with heuristic-to-analytic reasoning, a reflective
reasoning mechanism for AIGI detection. Mirage-R1 is trained in two stages: a
supervised-fine-tuning cold start, followed by a reinforcement learning stage.
By further adopting an inference-time adaptive thinking strategy, Mirage-R1 is
able to provide either a quick judgment or a more robust and accurate
conclusion, effectively balancing inference speed and performance. Extensive
experiments show that our model leads state-of-the-art detectors by 5% and 10%
on Mirage and the public benchmark, respectively. The benchmark and code will
be made publicly available.

### [3] [DianJin-OCR-R1: Enhancing OCR Capabilities via a Reasoning-and-Tool Interleaved Vision-Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13238)
*Qian Chen,Xianyin Zhang,Lifan Guo,Feng Chen,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DianJin-OCR-R1是一个推理增强的视觉语言模型框架，通过结合自身OCR能力和专家模型工具来解决LVLMs在OCR任务中的幻觉问题，显著提升识别性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在文档图像解析中容易产生幻觉，且相比专门训练的专家模型在OCR任务上效果较差，需要一种方法来结合两者的优势

Method: 提出推理-工具交替的VLM框架：先自行识别图像内容，然后调用专家模型获取参考结果，最后重新审视图像并反思推理过程来提供最终识别结果

Result: 在ReST和OmniDocBench基准测试中，DianJin-OCR-R1模型持续优于非推理版本和专家OCR模型，证明了方法的有效性

Conclusion: 通过推理增强和工具调用机制，能够有效缓解LVLMs的幻觉问题，以较低成本提升OCR性能，为文档图像解析提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have enabled a new
paradigm of end-to-end document image parsing, excelling in Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) tasks such as text, table, and formula recognition. However,
generative LVLMs, similarly to large language models (LLMs), are prone to
hallucinations--generating words that do not exist in input images.
Furthermore, LVLMs are designed for general purposes and tend to be less
effective on OCR tasks compared to expert models that are trained on
domain-specific datasets. In this paper, we propose DianJin-OCR-R1, a
reasoning-enhanced framework designed to address these limitations through
training reasoning-and-tool interleaved VLMs. Given a recognition instruction,
our DianJin-OCR-R1 model first recognizes the content in the input image by its
own OCR capabilities, and then calls other tools (i.e., other expert models) to
obtain their results as references, finally looks again the image and rethinks
about the reasoning process to provide the final recognized content. Since
architectures of expert models are tailored for specific OCR tasks, which makes
them less prone to hallucinations, their results can help VLMs mitigate
hallucinations. Additionally, expert models are typically smaller in scale and
easy to iterate, enabling performance improvements for VLMs at a lower cost. We
evaluate our model on ReST and OmniDocBench, and experimental results show that
our DianJin-OCR-R1 models consistently outperform their non-reasoning
counterparts and expert OCR models, which proves the effectiveness of our
method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于卷积神经网络的乌尔都语光学字符识别系统，通过组件分类和自动特征学习，在组件分类任务上达到99%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乌尔都语作为一种扇形文字，具有复杂的几何和形态结构，传统的分割基于识别方法往往正确率低。需要一种更有效的方法来处理这种上下文敏感性强的语言。

Method: 采用卷积神经网络(CNN)进行自动特征学习，构建了两层层次化神经网络。通过三个字符的排列组合生成数据集，并使用连通组件技术过滤掉不必要的图像，仅保留连字符。

Result: 模型在组件分类任务上达到了99%的高准确率，显示出卷积神经网络在处理复杂扇形文字识别任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: 组件基于的CNN方法能够有效处理乌尔都语识别的挑战，适合处理上下文敏感性强的扇形文字识别问题，为类似语言的OCR系统提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Urdu is a cursive script language and has similarities with Arabic and many
other South Asian languages. Urdu is difficult to classify due to its complex
geometrical and morphological structure. Character classification can be
processed further if segmentation technique is efficient, but due to context
sensitivity in Urdu, segmentation-based recognition often results with high
error rate. Our proposed approach for Urdu optical character recognition system
is a component-based classification relying on automatic feature learning
technique called convolutional neural network. CNN is trained and tested on
Urdu text dataset, which is generated through permutation process of three
characters and further proceeds to discarding unnecessary images by applying
connected component technique in order to obtain ligature only. Hierarchical
neural network is implemented with two levels to deal with three degrees of
character permutations and component classification Our model successfully
achieved 0.99% for component classification.

### [5] [CLoE: Curriculum Learning on Endoscopic Images for Robust MES Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13280)
*Zeynep Ozdemir,Hacer Yalim Keles,Omer Ozgur Tanriover*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLoE是一个课程学习框架，通过图像质量评估标签可靠性并结合序数结构，提升溃疡性结肠炎内镜图像严重程度分类的准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 梅奥内镜评分(MES)分类面临观察者间变异导致的标签噪声问题，且标准模型往往忽略评分的序数性质

Method: 使用基于波士顿肠道准备量表(BBPS)训练的轻量级模型估计图像质量作为标注置信度代理，构建从易到难的课程学习，并结合ResizeMix数据增强

Result: 在LIMUC和HyperKvasir数据集上，CLoE显著提升CNN和Transformer性能，ConvNeXt-Tiny在LIMUC上达到82.5%准确率和0.894 QWK

Conclusion: 难度感知训练策略能有效改善标签不确定性下的序数分类问题，具有重要临床应用价值

Abstract: Estimating disease severity from endoscopic images is essential in assessing
ulcerative colitis, where the Mayo Endoscopic Subscore (MES) is widely used to
grade inflammation. However, MES classification remains challenging due to
label noise from inter-observer variability and the ordinal nature of the
score, which standard models often ignore. We propose CLoE, a curriculum
learning framework that accounts for both label reliability and ordinal
structure. Image quality, estimated via a lightweight model trained on Boston
Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) labels, is used as a proxy for annotation
confidence to order samples from easy (clean) to hard (noisy). This curriculum
is further combined with ResizeMix augmentation to improve robustness.
Experiments on the LIMUC and HyperKvasir datasets, using both CNNs and
Transformers, show that CLoE consistently improves performance over strong
supervised and self-supervised baselines. For instance, ConvNeXt-Tiny reaches
82.5\% accuracy and a QWK of 0.894 on LIMUC with low computational cost. These
results highlight the potential of difficulty-aware training strategies for
improving ordinal classification under label uncertainty. Code will be released
at https://github.com/zeynepozdemir/CLoE.

### [6] [GaitCrafter: Diffusion Model for Biometric Preserving Gait Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13300)
*Sirshapan Mitra,Yogesh S. Rawat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GaitCrafter是一个基于扩散模型的步态序列合成框架，能够在轮廓域生成真实、时序一致且保留身份的步态数据，支持多种条件控制并保护隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 步态识别面临大规模标注数据集缺乏、个体多样化步态样本收集困难以及隐私保护等挑战，需要一种能够生成高质量合成数据的方法。

Method: 训练一个从头开始的视频扩散模型，专门使用步态轮廓数据，支持基于服装、携带物品、视角等多种条件的可控生成，并通过身份嵌入插值生成新身份。

Result: 将GaitCrafter生成的合成样本融入步态识别流程能提升性能，特别是在挑战性条件下；生成的新身份具有独特且一致的步态模式。

Conclusion: 该研究在利用扩散模型进行高质量、可控且隐私感知的步态数据生成方面迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Gait recognition is a valuable biometric task that enables the identification
of individuals from a distance based on their walking patterns. However, it
remains limited by the lack of large-scale labeled datasets and the difficulty
of collecting diverse gait samples for each individual while preserving
privacy. To address these challenges, we propose GaitCrafter, a diffusion-based
framework for synthesizing realistic gait sequences in the silhouette domain.
Unlike prior works that rely on simulated environments or alternative
generative models, GaitCrafter trains a video diffusion model from scratch,
exclusively on gait silhouette data. Our approach enables the generation of
temporally consistent and identity-preserving gait sequences. Moreover, the
generation process is controllable-allowing conditioning on various covariates
such as clothing, carried objects, and view angle. We show that incorporating
synthetic samples generated by GaitCrafter into the gait recognition pipeline
leads to improved performance, especially under challenging conditions.
Additionally, we introduce a mechanism to generate novel identities-synthetic
individuals not present in the original dataset-by interpolating identity
embeddings. These novel identities exhibit unique, consistent gait patterns and
are useful for training models while maintaining privacy of real subjects.
Overall, our work takes an important step toward leveraging diffusion models
for high-quality, controllable, and privacy-aware gait data generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Prune2Drive是一个用于自动驾驶多视角视觉语言模型的即插即用视觉token剪枝框架，通过多样性感知token选择和视图自适应剪枝控制，在保持性能的同时显著提升推理速度和减少内存消耗


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶系统中的多视角视觉语言模型处理高分辨率图像时会产生大量视觉token，导致推理延迟和内存消耗急剧增加，阻碍了实际部署

Method: 提出多样性感知token选择机制（受最远点采样启发）和视图自适应剪枝控制器，无需模型重训练或注意力图访问，与高效注意力实现兼容

Result: 在DriveLM和DriveLMM-o1基准测试中，仅保留10%视觉token即可实现6.4倍预填充加速和13.4%的FLOPs消耗，性能仅下降3%

Conclusion: Prune2Drive为多视角视觉语言模型提供了一种高效的token剪枝解决方案，显著提升了自动驾驶系统的实际部署可行性

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm in
autonomous driving (AD), offering a unified framework for perception,
reasoning, and decision-making by jointly modeling visual inputs and natural
language instructions. However, their deployment is hindered by the significant
computational overhead incurred when processing high-resolution, multi-view
images, a standard setup in AD systems with six or more synchronized cameras.
This overhead stems from the large number of visual tokens generated during
encoding, increasing inference latency and memory consumption due to the
quadratic complexity of self-attention. To address these challenges, we propose
Prune2Drive, a plug-and-play visual token pruning framework for multi-view VLMs
in autonomous driving. Prune2Drive introduces two core innovations: (i) a
diversity-aware token selection mechanism inspired by farthest point sampling,
which prioritizes semantic and spatial coverage across views rather than
relying solely on attention scores, and (ii) a view-adaptive pruning controller
that learns optimal pruning ratios for each camera view based on their
importance to downstream driving tasks. Unlike prior methods, Prune2Drive does
not require model retraining or access to attention maps, making it compatible
with modern efficient attention implementations. Extensive experiments on two
large-scale multi-view driving benchmarks, DriveLM and DriveLMM-o1, show that
Prune2Drive achieves significant speedups and memory savings while maintaining
or improving task performance. When retaining only 10% of the visual tokens,
our method achieves a 6.40$\times$ speedup in the prefilling phase and consumes
13.4% of the original FLOPs, with only a 3% performance drop on the DriveLM
benchmark.

### [8] [DAASH: A Meta-Attack Framework for Synthesizing Effective and Stealthy Adversarial Examples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13309)
*Abdullah Al Nomaan Nafi,Habibur Rahaman,Zafaryab Haider,Tanzim Mahfuz,Fnu Suya,Swarup Bhunia,Prabuddha Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAASH是一个完全可微分的元攻击框架，通过策略性地组合现有的Lp范数攻击方法，生成有效且感知对齐的对抗样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Lp范数约束对抗样本往往与人类感知不一致，且不清楚Lp约束攻击的见解是否能有效提升感知效果。

Method: 采用多阶段方式运作：每阶段使用学习到的自适应权重聚合多个基础攻击的候选对抗样本，并通过新颖的元损失函数联合最小化误分类损失和感知失真。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet上显著优于最先进的感知攻击方法AdvAD，攻击成功率提高20.63%，SSIM、LPIPS和FID指标分别提升约11、0.015和5.7。

Conclusion: DAASH能够很好地泛化到未见过的防御方法，是评估鲁棒性的实用且强大的基准，无需为每个新防御手工设计自适应攻击。

Abstract: Numerous techniques have been proposed for generating adversarial examples in
white-box settings under strict Lp-norm constraints. However, such norm-bounded
examples often fail to align well with human perception, and only recently have
a few methods begun specifically exploring perceptually aligned adversarial
examples. Moreover, it remains unclear whether insights from Lp-constrained
attacks can be effectively leveraged to improve perceptual efficacy. In this
paper, we introduce DAASH, a fully differentiable meta-attack framework that
generates effective and perceptually aligned adversarial examples by
strategically composing existing Lp-based attack methods. DAASH operates in a
multi-stage fashion: at each stage, it aggregates candidate adversarial
examples from multiple base attacks using learned, adaptive weights and
propagates the result to the next stage. A novel meta-loss function guides this
process by jointly minimizing misclassification loss and perceptual distortion,
enabling the framework to dynamically modulate the contribution of each base
attack throughout the stages. We evaluate DAASH on adversarially trained models
across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. Despite relying solely on
Lp-constrained based methods, DAASH significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
perceptual attacks such as AdvAD -- achieving higher attack success rates
(e.g., 20.63\% improvement) and superior visual quality, as measured by SSIM,
LPIPS, and FID (improvements $\approx$ of 11, 0.015, and 5.7, respectively).
Furthermore, DAASH generalizes well to unseen defenses, making it a practical
and strong baseline for evaluating robustness without requiring handcrafted
adaptive attacks for each new defense.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提供可重复、定量的标准来支持数据驱动的手术规划、患者咨询和客观效果评估，解决面部整形外科预后评估缺乏客观标准的问题。

Method: 构建了最大的筛选后的手术前后面部图像数据集（7,160张照片，1,259名患者），采用自动化关键点检测、几何面部对称性计算、深度学习年龄估计和鼻部形态分析的组合方法。

Result: 在美宝鼻整形子集中，96.2%患者至少在一个鼻部指标上显示改善，其中鼻宽与面宽比改善最明显（77.0%）。在更广泛的正面照群体中，71.3%患者在全局面部对称性或感知年龄方面显示显著改善。患者身份在手术后保持一致（真正匹配率达99.5%以上）。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了可重复、定量的标准，为数据驱动的手术规划、患者沟通和客观效果评估提供了工具，同时可以分析不同医生之间的效果差异。

Abstract: We introduce a scalable, interpretable computer-vision framework for
quantifying aesthetic outcomes of facial plastic surgery using frontal
photographs. Our pipeline leverages automated landmark detection, geometric
facial symmetry computation, deep-learning-based age estimation, and nasal
morphology analysis. To perform this study, we first assemble the largest
curated dataset of paired pre- and post-operative facial images to date,
encompassing 7,160 photographs from 1,259 patients. This dataset includes a
dedicated rhinoplasty-only subset consisting of 732 images from 366 patients,
96.2% of whom showed improvement in at least one of the three nasal
measurements with statistically significant group-level change. Among these
patients, the greatest statistically significant improvements (p < 0.001)
occurred in the alar width to face width ratio (77.0%), nose length to face
height ratio (41.5%), and alar width to intercanthal ratio (39.3%). Among the
broader frontal-view cohort, comprising 989 rigorously filtered subjects, 71.3%
exhibited significant enhancements in global facial symmetry or perceived age
(p < 0.01). Importantly, our analysis shows that patient identity remains
consistent post-operatively, with True Match Rates of 99.5% and 99.6% at a
False Match Rate of 0.01% for the rhinoplasty-specific and general patient
cohorts, respectively. Additionally, we analyze inter-practitioner variability
in improvement rates. By providing reproducible, quantitative benchmarks and a
novel dataset, our pipeline facilitates data-driven surgical planning, patient
counseling, and objective outcome evaluation across practices.

Result: 某些小型语言模型通过精心设计的提示词可以达到竞争力的准确性

Conclusion: 提示工程可以在不需要用户拥有深度AI知识的情况下，实质性提升小型语言模型在医疗健康应用中的性能

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in natural
language processing and multi-modal understanding. However, their high
computational cost, limited accessibility, and data privacy concerns hinder
their adoption in resource-constrained healthcare environments. This study
investigates the performance of small language models (SLMs) in a medical
imaging classification task, comparing different models and prompt designs to
identify the optimal combination for accuracy and usability. Using the NIH
Chest X-ray dataset, we evaluate multiple SLMs on the task of classifying chest
X-ray positions (anteroposterior [AP] vs. posteroanterior [PA]) under three
prompt strategies: baseline instruction, incremental summary prompts, and
correction-based reflective prompts. Our results show that certain SLMs achieve
competitive accuracy with well-crafted prompts, suggesting that prompt
engineering can substantially enhance SLM performance in healthcare
applications without requiring deep AI expertise from end users.

### [12] [Mitigating Easy Option Bias in Multiple-Choice Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13428)
*Hao Zhang,Chen Li,Basura Fernando*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文发现多选项视觉问答数据集中存在"易选项偏差"(EOB)问题，视觉-语言模型只需视觉和选项就能猜出正确答案。研究者提出了GroundAttack工具来生成难度更高的负面选项，以测试模型的真实能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现当前多选项VQA数据集中存在明显的偏差，允许模型不需问题信息便能猜出正确答案，这影响了对模型真实能力的评估。

Method: 通过基础实验归因于视觉相关性不平衡，并提出GroundAttack工具自动生成视觉上可信的难负面选项，创建无EOB偏差的数据集。

Result: 在新的EOB-free注释上，当前VLMs在(V+O)设置下接近随机准确率，在(V+Q+O)设置下准确率也大幅下降，证明了新数据集能更真实地评估模型能力。

Conclusion: 论文揭示了多选项VQA数据集中存在的系统性偏差问题，并提供了有效的解决方案，为更准确地评估视觉-语言模型的问答能力奠定了基础。

Abstract: In this early study, we observe an Easy-Options Bias (EOB) issue in some
multiple-choice Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks such as MMStar,
RealWorldQA, SEED-Bench, Next-QA, STAR benchmark and Video-MME. This bias
allows vision-language models (VLMs) to select the correct answer using only
the vision (V) and options (O) as inputs, without the need for the question
(Q). Through grounding experiments, we attribute the bias to an imbalance in
visual relevance: the correct answer typically aligns more closely with the
visual contents than the negative options in feature space, creating a shortcut
for VLMs to infer the answer via simply vision-option similarity matching. To
fix this, we introduce GroundAttack, a toolkit that automatically generates
hard negative options as visually plausible as the correct answer. We apply it
to the NExT-QA and MMStar datasets, creating new EOB-free annotations. On these
EOB-free annotations, current VLMs approach to random accuracies under (V+O)
settings, and drop to non-saturated accuracies under (V+Q+O) settings,
providing a more realistic evaluation of VLMs' QA ability. Codes and new
annotations will be released soon.

Conclusion: 有效的知识蓄粉和结构化多代理监督能够让轻量级视觉-语言模型掌握复杂的推理能力。VISTA的紧凑架构便于在边缘设备上部署，实现实时风险监控而无需大规模基础设施升级。

Abstract: Comprehensive highway scene understanding and robust traffic risk inference
are vital for advancing Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and autonomous
driving. Traditional approaches often struggle with scalability and
generalization, particularly under the complex and dynamic conditions of
real-world environments. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
structured prompting and knowledge distillation framework that enables
automatic generation of high-quality traffic scene annotations and contextual
risk assessments. Our framework orchestrates two large Vision-Language Models
(VLMs): GPT-4o and o3-mini, using a structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategy
to produce rich, multi-perspective outputs. These outputs serve as
knowledge-enriched pseudo-annotations for supervised fine-tuning of a much
smaller student VLM. The resulting compact 3B-scale model, named VISTA (Vision
for Intelligent Scene and Traffic Analysis), is capable of understanding
low-resolution traffic videos and generating semantically faithful, risk-aware
captions. Despite its significantly reduced parameter count, VISTA achieves
strong performance across established captioning metrics (BLEU-4, METEOR,
ROUGE-L, and CIDEr) when benchmarked against its teacher models. This
demonstrates that effective knowledge distillation and structured multi-agent
supervision can empower lightweight VLMs to capture complex reasoning
capabilities. The compact architecture of VISTA facilitates efficient
deployment on edge devices, enabling real-time risk monitoring without
requiring extensive infrastructure upgrades.

*Shuai Tan,Bin Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EDTalk++是一个完全解耦的说话头生成框架，通过四个轻量级模块分别控制嘴型、头部姿态、眼部运动和情感表达，支持视频和音频输入，实现了面部动作的独立操控和跨模态共享。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在面部特征解耦方面存在不足，无法实现多个面部动作的独立控制，也缺乏对不同输入模态的兼容性。需要探索面部特征的解耦空间，确保它们既能独立操作互不干扰，又能跨模态共享。

Result: 实验证明了EDTalk++的有效性，能够实现对面部多个动作的独立控制，并支持视频和音频多种输入模态。

Conclusion: EDTalk++提供了一个完整的解耦框架，成功解决了面部动作独立控制和多模态输入兼容的问题，为可控说话头生成提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Achieving disentangled control over multiple facial motions and accommodating
diverse input modalities greatly enhances the application and entertainment of
the talking head generation. This necessitates a deep exploration of the
decoupling space for facial features, ensuring that they a) operate
independently without mutual interference and b) can be preserved to share with
different modal inputs, both aspects often neglected in existing methods. To
address this gap, this paper proposes EDTalk++, a novel full disentanglement
framework for controllable talking head generation. Our framework enables
individual manipulation of mouth shape, head pose, eye movement, and emotional
expression, conditioned on video or audio inputs. Specifically, we employ four
lightweight modules to decompose the facial dynamics into four distinct latent
spaces representing mouth, pose, eye, and expression, respectively. Each space
is characterized by a set of learnable bases whose linear combinations define
specific motions. To ensure independence and accelerate training, we enforce
orthogonality among bases and devise an efficient training strategy to allocate
motion responsibilities to each space without relying on external knowledge.
The learned bases are then stored in corresponding banks, enabling shared
visual priors with audio input. Furthermore, considering the properties of each
space, we propose an Audio-to-Motion module for audio-driven talking head
synthesis. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of
EDTalk++.

Abstract: Kidney stone classification from endoscopic images is critical for
personalized treatment and recurrence prevention. While convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) have shown promise in this task, their limited ability to
capture long-range dependencies can hinder performance under variable imaging
conditions. This study presents a comparative analysis between Vision
Transformers (ViTs) and CNN-based models, evaluating their performance on two
ex vivo datasets comprising CCD camera and flexible ureteroscope images. The
ViT-base model pretrained on ImageNet-21k consistently outperformed a ResNet50
baseline across multiple imaging conditions. For instance, in the most visually
complex subset (Section patches from endoscopic images), the ViT model achieved
95.2% accuracy and 95.1% F1-score, compared to 64.5% and 59.3% with ResNet50.
In the mixed-view subset from CCD-camera images, ViT reached 87.1% accuracy
versus 78.4% with CNN. These improvements extend across precision and recall as
well. The results demonstrate that ViT-based architectures provide superior
classification performance and offer a scalable alternative to conventional
CNNs for kidney stone image analysis.

TL;DR: MINR通过共享中间层来高效编码多张图像，在保持性能的同时减少60%参数，可扩展到处理100张图像


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统隐式神经表示(INR)为每张图像使用单独的MLP网络，导致编码多图像时计算和存储效率低下

Method: 分析训练好的INR层间权重分布，发现中间层分布模式高度相似，因此共享中间层，保留输入输出层为图像特定，并为每张图像设计额外的投影层来捕获独特特征

Result: 在图像重建和超分辨率任务中，MINR节省60%参数的同时保持可比性能，可处理100张图像且平均PSNR达34dB

Conclusion: MINR方法有效解决了多图像编码的效率问题，具有鲁棒性和良好的扩展性

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) aim to parameterize discrete signals
through implicit continuous functions. However, formulating each image with a
separate neural network~(typically, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)) leads to
computational and storage inefficiencies when encoding multi-images. To address
this issue, we propose MINR, sharing specific layers to encode multi-image
efficiently. We first compare the layer-wise weight distributions for several
trained INRs and find that corresponding intermediate layers follow highly
similar distribution patterns. Motivated by this, we share these intermediate
layers across multiple images while preserving the input and output layers as
input-specific. In addition, we design an extra novel projection layer for each
image to capture its unique features. Experimental results on image
reconstruction and super-resolution tasks demonstrate that MINR can save up to
60\% parameters while maintaining comparable performance. Particularly, MINR
scales effectively to handle 100 images, maintaining an average peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 34 dB. Further analysis of various backbones
proves the robustness of the proposed MINR.

TL;DR: DHQ是一种针对隐式神经表示(INRs)的分布感知哈达玛量化方案，通过对权重和激活值进行哈达玛变换标准化分布，然后应用标准量化器，显著提升了硬件效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的INR量化方法主要关注权重量化，缺乏激活值量化，硬件节省有限。INRs依赖全精度计算导致显著的硬件开销，需要同时量化权重和激活值来充分发挥量化优势。

Method: 提出DHQ方案：1)分析发现INRs中首尾层权重和激活值的分布与中间层显著不同；2)使用哈达玛变换将这些不同分布标准化为统一的钟形分布；3)应用标准量化器进行量化；4)提供了FPGA实现验证硬件效率。

Result: 在多种图像重建任务上的实验表明，DHQ相比全精度版本：延迟降低32.7%，能耗降低40.1%，资源利用率最高减少98.3%，且优于之前的量化方法。

Conclusion: DHQ通过分布感知的哈达玛变换有效解决了INRs中权重和激活值分布差异问题，实现了高效的硬件量化，为INRs的实际部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals using
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) with complex activation functions. While INRs
achieve superior performance, they depend on full-precision number
representation for accurate computation, resulting in significant hardware
overhead. Previous INR quantization approaches have primarily focused on weight
quantization, offering only limited hardware savings due to the lack of
activation quantization. To fully exploit the hardware benefits of
quantization, we propose DHQ, a novel distribution-aware Hadamard quantization
scheme that targets both weights and activations in INRs. Our analysis shows
that the weights in the first and last layers have distributions distinct from
those in the intermediate layers, while the activations in the last layer
differ significantly from those in the preceding layers. Instead of customizing
quantizers individually, we utilize the Hadamard transformation to standardize
these diverse distributions into a unified bell-shaped form, supported by both
empirical evidence and theoretical analysis, before applying a standard
quantizer. To demonstrate the practical advantages of our approach, we present
an FPGA implementation of DHQ that highlights its hardware efficiency.
Experiments on diverse image reconstruction tasks show that DHQ outperforms
previous quantization methods, reducing latency by 32.7\%, energy consumption
by 40.1\%, and resource utilization by up to 98.3\% compared to full-precision
counterparts.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals in a
continuous manner using neural networks, demonstrating significant value across
various multimedia applications. However, the vulnerability of INRs presents a
critical challenge for their real-world deployments, as the network weights
might be subjected to unavoidable perturbations. In this work, we investigate
the robustness of INRs for the first time and find that even minor
perturbations can lead to substantial performance degradation in the quality of
signal reconstruction. To mitigate this issue, we formulate the robustness
problem in INRs by minimizing the difference between loss with and without
weight perturbations. Furthermore, we derive a novel robust loss function to
regulate the gradient of the reconstruction loss with respect to weights,
thereby enhancing the robustness. Extensive experiments on reconstruction tasks
across multiple modalities demonstrate that our method achieves up to a 7.5~dB
improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) values compared to original
INRs under noisy conditions.

Conclusion: FAMNet通过多任务学习和注意力机制，有效提取了微表情的细粒度特征和时空特征，在多个数据集上都取得了超过现有方法的识别性能，为微表情识别领域提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Micro-expressions recognition (MER) has essential application value in many
fields, but the short duration and low intensity of micro-expressions (MEs)
bring considerable challenges to MER. The current MER methods in deep learning
mainly include three data loading methods: static images, dynamic image
sequence, and a combination of the two streams. How to effectively extract MEs'
fine-grained and spatiotemporal features has been difficult to solve. This
paper proposes a new MER method based on multi-task learning and hierarchical
attention, which fully extracts MEs' omni-directional features by merging 2D
and 3D CNNs. The fusion model consists of a 2D CNN AMNet2D and a 3D CNN
AMNet3D, with similar structures consisting of a shared backbone network
Resnet18 and attention modules. During training, the model adopts different
data loading methods to adapt to two specific networks respectively, jointly
trains on the tasks of MER and facial action unit detection (FAUD), and adopts
the parameter hard sharing for information association, which further improves
the effect of the MER task, and the final fused model is called FAMNet.
Extensive experimental results show that our proposed FAMNet significantly
improves task performance. On the SAMM, CASME II and MMEW datasets, FAMNet
achieves 83.75% (UAR) and 84.03% (UF1). Furthermore, on the challenging
CAS(ME)$^3$ dataset, FAMNet achieves 51% (UAR) and 43.42% (UF1).

Abstract: 4D radar-based object detection has garnered great attention for its
robustness in adverse weather conditions and capacity to deliver rich spatial

noise patterns and extract discriminative features from raw 4D radar data.
Designed as a plug-and-play architecture, our solution enables seamless
integration into voxel-based detection frameworks without modifying existing

cross-modal supervision during training while maintaining full radar-only
operation during inference. Extensive evaluation on the challenging Dual-Radar

effectiveness of our framework in enhancing detection robustness. Comprehensive

Conclusion: BDCL框架通过双层解耦和一致性学习有效提升了多视图聚类的性能，增强了特征的簇间区分性和簇内紧凑性

Abstract: Multi-view clustering has shown to be an effective method for analyzing
underlying patterns in multi-view data. The performance of clustering can be
improved by learning the consistency and complementarity between multi-view
features, however, cluster-oriented representation learning is often
overlooked. In this paper, we propose a novel Bi-level Decoupling and
Consistency Learning framework (BDCL) to further explore the effective
representation for multi-view data to enhance inter-cluster discriminability
and intra-cluster compactness of features in multi-view clustering. Our
framework comprises three modules: 1) The multi-view instance learning module
aligns the consistent information while preserving the private features between
views through reconstruction autoencoder and contrastive learning. 2) The
bi-level decoupling of features and clusters enhances the discriminability of
feature space and cluster space. 3) The consistency learning module treats the
different views of the sample and their neighbors as positive pairs, learns the
consistency of their clustering assignments, and further compresses the
intra-cluster space. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared with the SOTA
methods. Our code is published on https://github.com/LouisDong95/BDCL.

Motivation: 现有HDR技术忽视了快门速度和ISO之间的复杂交互作用，以及动态场景中运动模糊的影响，导致高ISO产生噪声、长快门引发模糊的质量问题

Method: 提出AdaptiveAE方法，采用强化学习优化快门速度和ISO组合选择，集成了包含运动模糊和噪声模拟的图像合成流程，利用语义信息和曝光直方图

Result: 在多个数据集上达到了状态前沿性能，能够根据用户定义的曝光时间预算自适应地选择最优的ISO和快门速度序列

Conclusion: AdaptiveAE能够找到比传统方案更好的曝光策略，有效解决了动态场景中HDR拍摄的质量挑战

Abstract: Mainstream high dynamic range imaging techniques typically rely on fusing
multiple images captured with different exposure setups (shutter speed and
ISO). A good balance between shutter speed and ISO is crucial for achieving
high-quality HDR, as high ISO values introduce significant noise, while long
shutter speeds can lead to noticeable motion blur. However, existing methods
often overlook the complex interaction between shutter speed and ISO and fail
to account for motion blur effects in dynamic scenes.
  In this work, we propose AdaptiveAE, a reinforcement learning-based method
that optimizes the selection of shutter speed and ISO combinations to maximize
HDR reconstruction quality in dynamic environments. AdaptiveAE integrates an
image synthesis pipeline that incorporates motion blur and noise simulation
into our training procedure, leveraging semantic information and exposure
histograms. It can adaptively select optimal ISO and shutter speed sequences
based on a user-defined exposure time budget, and find a better exposure
schedule than traditional solutions. Experimental results across multiple
datasets demonstrate that it achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Badminton is known as one of the fastest racket sports in the world. Despite
doubles matches being more prevalent in international tournaments than singles,
previous research has mainly focused on singles due to the challenges in data
availability and multi-person tracking. To address this gap, we designed an
approach that transfers singles-trained models to doubles analysis. We
extracted keypoints from the ShuttleSet single matches dataset using ViT-Pose
and embedded them through a contrastive learning framework based on ST-GCN. To
improve tracking stability, we incorporated a custom multi-object tracking
algorithm that resolves ID switching issues from fast and overlapping player
movements. A Transformer-based classifier then determines shot occurrences
based on the learned embeddings. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of
extending pose-based shot recognition to doubles badminton, broadening
analytics capabilities. This work establishes a foundation for doubles-specific
datasets to enhance understanding of this predominant yet understudied format

### [27] [2D Gaussians Meet Visual Tokenizer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13515)
*Yiang Shi,Xiaoyang Guo,Wei Yin,Mingkai Jia,Qian Zhang,Xiaolin Hu,Wenyu Liu,Xinggang Wan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VGQ是一种新的图像tokenizer范式，通过将2D高斯分布整合到视觉码本量化框架中，显式增强结构建模能力，在重建质量上显著超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于量化的tokenizer（如VQ-GAN）主要关注外观特征如纹理和颜色，往往忽视几何结构，因为其基于patch的设计存在固有局限性。

Method: 提出视觉高斯量化（VGQ）框架，将图像潜在表示编码为2D高斯分布，直接建模位置、旋转和尺度等结构相关参数，通过增加2D高斯密度来提升重建保真度。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256基准测试中，VGQ达到rFID 1.00的重建质量，通过增加高斯密度进一步将rFID提升至0.556，PSNR达到24.93，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: VGQ通过整合2D高斯分布有效解决了传统量化方法在结构建模上的不足，在token效率和视觉丰富度之间提供了灵活权衡，实现了state-of-the-art的重建性能。

Abstract: The image tokenizer is a critical component in AR image generation, as it
determines how rich and structured visual content is encoded into compact
representations. Existing quantization-based tokenizers such as VQ-GAN
primarily focus on appearance features like texture and color, often neglecting
geometric structures due to their patch-based design. In this work, we explored
how to incorporate more visual information into the tokenizer and proposed a
new framework named Visual Gaussian Quantization (VGQ), a novel tokenizer
paradigm that explicitly enhances structural modeling by integrating 2D
Gaussians into traditional visual codebook quantization frameworks. Our
approach addresses the inherent limitations of naive quantization methods such
as VQ-GAN, which struggle to model structured visual information due to their
patch-based design and emphasis on texture and color. In contrast, VGQ encodes
image latents as 2D Gaussian distributions, effectively capturing geometric and
spatial structures by directly modeling structure-related parameters such as
position, rotation and scale. We further demonstrate that increasing the
density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens leads to significant gains in
reconstruction fidelity, providing a flexible trade-off between token
efficiency and visual richness. On the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, VGQ achieves
strong reconstruction quality with an rFID score of 1.00. Furthermore, by
increasing the density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens, VGQ gains a
significant boost in reconstruction capability and achieves a state-of-the-art
reconstruction rFID score of 0.556 and a PSNR of 24.93, substantially
outperforming existing methods. Codes will be released soon.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于几何形状知识的分布检验框架，利用基础模型特征的转移性，在联邦学习和长尾识别任务中有效解决数据异质性和样本不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习中观察样本与真实分布之间存在差距，这可能由采样偏差、噪声等因素导致。论文意图利用基础模型特征的几何形状转移性来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出几何知识导向的分布检验框架：1）在联邦学习中，设计技术在隐私约束下获取全局几何形状，并利用这些知识生成新样本来平衡客户端与全局观测之间的差距；2）在长尾识别中，利用来自样本丰富类别的几何知识来恢复样本稀缺尾部类别的真实分布。

Result: 综合实验表明，提出的几何知识导向分布检验框架能够有效克服由数据异质性和样本不平衡导致的信息缺失问题，在多个标准测试集上都取得了性能提升。

Conclusion: 论文证明了基础模型特征的几何形状具有显著的转移性，通过几何知识导向的方法可以有效检验数据分布，为解决实际应用中的数据问题提供了新的视角和方法。

Abstract: Despite the fast progress of deep learning, one standing challenge is the gap
of the observed training samples and the underlying true distribution. There
are multiple reasons for the causing of this gap e.g. sampling bias, noise etc.
In the era of foundation models, we show that when leveraging the off-the-shelf
(vision) foundation models (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2) for feature extraction, the
geometric shapes of the resulting feature distributions exhibit remarkable
transferability across domains and datasets. To verify its practical
usefulness, we embody our geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration
framework in two popular and challenging settings: federated learning and
long-tailed recognition. In the federated setting, we devise a technique of
acquiring the global geometric shape under privacy constraints, then leverage
this knowledge to generate new samples for clients, in the aim of bridging the
gap between local and global observations. In long-tailed learning, it utilizes
the geometric knowledge transferred from sample-rich categories to recover the
true distribution for sample-scarce tail classes. Comprehensive experiments
show that our proposed geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration
effectively overcomes information deficits caused by data heterogeneity and
sample imbalance, with boosted performance across benchmarks.

TL;DR: 这篇论文首次对比了开源视觉-语言模型和传统深度学习模型在面部情感识别任务上的性能，发现传统模型在低质量图像上显著优于VLMs，并提出了一种新的图像恢复流水线来应对数据噪声问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面部情感识别对人机交互和心理健康诊断至关重要。目前缺乏对开源视觉-语言模型在这一具有挑战性的任务上的系统性评估，特别是在面对噪声数据时的表现。

Method: 使用FER-2013数据集（35,887张低分辨率灰度图像，7个情感类别），对比了Phi-3.5 Vision、CLIP等VLMs与VGG19、ResNet-50、EfficientNet-B0等传统模型。提出了整合GFPGAN图像恢复技术的新流水线来处理噪声数据。

Result: 传统模型显著优于VLMs：EfficientNet-B0达到86.44%准确率，ResNet-50为85.72%，而CLIP和Phi-3.5 Vision分别只有64.07%和51.66%。还提供了详细的计算成本分析。

Conclusion: VLMs在低质量视觉任务中存在显著局限性，需要适应噪声环境。该研究为情感识别预测研究提供了可复现的基准测试，并为实际部署提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) is crucial for applications such as
human-computer interaction and mental health diagnostics. This study presents
the first empirical comparison of open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs),
including Phi-3.5 Vision and CLIP, against traditional deep learning models
VGG19, ResNet-50, and EfficientNet-B0 on the challenging FER-2013 dataset,
which contains 35,887 low-resolution grayscale images across seven emotion
classes. To address the mismatch between VLM training assumptions and the noisy
nature of FER data, we introduce a novel pipeline that integrates GFPGAN-based
image restoration with FER evaluation. Results show that traditional models,
particularly EfficientNet-B0 (86.44%) and ResNet-50 (85.72%), significantly
outperform VLMs like CLIP (64.07%) and Phi-3.5 Vision (51.66%), highlighting
the limitations of VLMs in low-quality visual tasks. In addition to performance
evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy, we provide a
detailed computational cost analysis covering preprocessing, training,
inference, and evaluation phases, offering practical insights for deployment.
This work underscores the need for adapting VLMs to noisy environments and
provides a reproducible benchmark for future research in emotion recognition.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于3D高斯拖尾技术的表情感知头部虚拟人重建方法EAvatar，通过稀疏表情控制机制和3D先验知识提升了细细微表情捕捉能力和纹理连续性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3DGS基础方法在捕捉细细微面部表情和保持局部纹理连续性方面面临挑战，特别是在高可变形区域。

Method: 提出稀疏表情控制机制，用少量关键高斯影响邻近高斯的变形；利用预训练生成模型的高质量3D先验知识提供面部几何结构指导。

Result: 实验结果显示方法能够产生更准确、视觉一致的头部重建结果，提升了表情可控性和细节保真度。

Conclusion: EAvatar框架通过表惉感知和变形感知的设计，有效解决了高保真头部虚拟人重建中的细微表惉捕捉和纹理连续性问题。

Abstract: High-fidelity head avatar reconstruction plays a crucial role in AR/VR,
gaming, and multimedia content creation. Recent advances in 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated effectiveness in modeling complex geometry
with real-time rendering capability and are now widely used in high-fidelity
head avatar reconstruction tasks. However, existing 3DGS-based methods still
face significant challenges in capturing fine-grained facial expressions and
preserving local texture continuity, especially in highly deformable regions.
To mitigate these limitations, we propose a novel 3DGS-based framework termed
EAvatar for head reconstruction that is both expression-aware and
deformation-aware. Our method introduces a sparse expression control mechanism,
where a small number of key Gaussians are used to influence the deformation of
their neighboring Gaussians, enabling accurate modeling of local deformations
and fine-scale texture transitions. Furthermore, we leverage high-quality 3D
priors from pretrained generative models to provide a more reliable facial
geometry, offering structural guidance that improves convergence stability and
shape accuracy during training. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method produces more accurate and visually coherent head reconstructions with
improved expression controllability and detail fidelity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FLAIR提出了一种频率和局部性感知的隐式神经表示方法，通过RC-GAUSS激活函数和WEGE编码机制解决了现有INRs缺乏频率选择性和空间局部性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有隐式神经表示(INRs)缺乏频率选择性、空间局部性和稀疏表示，导致过度依赖冗余信号分量，出现频谱偏差问题，难以捕捉高频细节。

Method: 提出FLAIR方法，包含两个关键创新：1) RC-GAUSS激活函数，在时频不确定性原理约束下实现显式频率选择和空间定位；2) 小波能量引导编码(WEGE)，利用离散小波变换计算能量分数并显式引导频率信息。

Result: 该方法在2D图像表示与恢复以及3D重建任务中持续优于现有INRs方法。

Conclusion: FLAIR通过频率和局部性感知机制有效解决了INRs的频谱偏差问题，提升了高频细节的捕捉能力。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) leverage neural networks to map
coordinates to corresponding signals, enabling continuous and compact
representations. This paradigm has driven significant advances in various
vision tasks. However, existing INRs lack frequency selectivity, spatial
localization, and sparse representations, leading to an over-reliance on
redundant signal components. Consequently, they exhibit spectral bias, tending
to learn low-frequency components early while struggling to capture fine
high-frequency details. To address these issues, we propose FLAIR (Frequency-
and Locality-Aware Implicit Neural Representations), which incorporates two key
innovations. The first is RC-GAUSS, a novel activation designed for explicit
frequency selection and spatial localization under the constraints of the
time-frequency uncertainty principle (TFUP). The second is
Wavelet-Energy-Guided Encoding (WEGE), which leverages the discrete wavelet
transform (DWT) to compute energy scores and explicitly guide frequency
information to the network. Our method consistently outperforms existing INRs
in 2D image representation and restoration, as well as 3D reconstruction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于硬件的眼动追踪系统成本高、校准复杂且硬件兼容性受限，限制了注视点渲染技术的广泛应用，需要开发纯软件的解决方案

Method: 采用球形视觉变换器处理360度VR场景，结合LSTM时序编码器捕捉注视序列模式，通过多模态融合网络整合空间场景特征和时序注视动态来预测未来注视位置

Result: 在综合VR数据集上实现3.83度中位角误差，比传统显著性基线方法提升24%，提供可靠的置信度校准，在不同空间区域和场景类型中保持稳定性能

Conclusion: 纯软件注视预测可用于VR注视点渲染，使性能提升更易于在不同VR平台和应用中部署，无需额外硬件要求

Abstract: Foveated rendering significantly reduces computational demands in virtual
reality applications by concentrating rendering quality where users focus their
gaze. Current approaches require expensive hardware-based eye tracking systems,
limiting widespread adoption due to cost, calibration complexity, and hardware
compatibility constraints. This paper presents GazeProphet, a software-only
approach for predicting gaze locations in VR environments without requiring
dedicated eye tracking hardware. The approach combines a Spherical Vision
Transformer for processing 360-degree VR scenes with an LSTM-based temporal
encoder that captures gaze sequence patterns. A multi-modal fusion network
integrates spatial scene features with temporal gaze dynamics to predict future
gaze locations with associated confidence estimates. Experimental evaluation on
a comprehensive VR dataset demonstrates that GazeProphet achieves a median
angular error of 3.83 degrees, outperforming traditional saliency-based
baselines by 24% while providing reliable confidence calibration. The approach
maintains consistent performance across different spatial regions and scene
types, enabling practical deployment in VR systems without additional hardware
requirements. Statistical analysis confirms the significance of improvements
across all evaluation metrics. These results show that software-only gaze
prediction can work for VR foveated rendering, making this performance boost
more accessible to different VR platforms and apps.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式人脸视频编码（GFVC）虽然在码率-头真性能方面表现优异，但大型模型参数和高计算成本阻碍了其实际部署。

Method: 提出双模式优化：1）结构重设-用更薄、更高效的层替换传统3x3卷积；2）两阶段适配性通道剪枝策略-训练时软剪枝通过可学习阈值识别冗余通道，训练后硬剪枝用导出的掩码永久删除。

Result: 实验结果显示，与基准线相比，该方法实现了90.4%的参数减少和88.9%的计算节省，并在感知质量指标上超过最新视频编码标准VVC。

Conclusion: 该方法有望在资源受限环境（如移动边缘设备）中实现高效的GFVC部署。

Abstract: Generative Face Video Coding (GFVC) achieves superior rate-distortion
performance by leveraging the strong inference capabilities of deep generative
models. However, its practical deployment is hindered by large model parameters
and high computational costs. To address this, we propose a lightweight GFVC
framework that introduces dual-mode optimization -- combining architectural
redesign and operational refinement -- to reduce complexity whilst preserving
reconstruction quality. Architecturally, we replace traditional 3 x 3
convolutions with slimmer and more efficient layers, reducing complexity
without compromising feature expressiveness. Operationally, we develop a
two-stage adaptive channel pruning strategy: (1) soft pruning during training
identifies redundant channels via learnable thresholds, and (2) hard pruning
permanently eliminates these channels post-training using a derived mask. This
dual-phase approach ensures both training stability and inference efficiency.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed lightweight dual-mode
optimization for GFVC can achieve 90.4% parameter reduction and 88.9%
computation saving compared to the baseline, whilst achieving superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art video coding standard Versatile Video
Coding (VVC) in terms of perceptual-level quality metrics. As such, the
proposed method is expected to enable efficient GFVC deployment in
resource-constrained environments such as mobile edge devices.

Result: 实验结果显示该方法能够有效增加突发信号的信息含量，提升SNN性能，同时遵循神经科学原则

Conclusion: 这种生物受启发的方法有望突破神经科学计算的当前限制，促进SNN的更广泛应用

Abstract: In recent years, neuromorphic computing and spiking neural networks (SNNs)
have ad-vanced rapidly through integration with deep learning. However, the
performance of SNNs still lags behind that of convolutional neural networks
(CNNs), primarily due to the limited information capacity of spike-based data.
Although some studies have attempted to improve SNN performance by training
them with non-spiking inputs such as static images, this approach deviates from
the original intent of neuromorphic computing, which emphasizes spike-based
information processing. To address this issue, we propose a Neuron-like
Encoding method that generates spike data based on the intrinsic operational
principles and functions of biological neurons. This method is further enhanced
by the incorporation of an artificial pho-toreceptor layer, enabling spike data
to carry both color and luminance information, thereby forming a complete
visual spike signal. Experimental results using the Integrate-and-Fire neuron
model demonstrate that this biologically inspired approach effectively
increases the information content of spike signals and improves SNN
performance, all while adhering to neuromorphic principles. We believe this
concept holds strong potential for future development and may contribute to
overcoming current limitations in neuro-morphic computing, facilitating broader
applications of SNNs.

TL;DR: DictAS是一个新颖的少样本异常分割框架，通过自监督字典查找机制实现跨类别泛化，无需目标数据重新训练，仅使用少量正常参考图像作为视觉提示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在少样本异常分割中的跨类别泛化能力严重依赖已知异常样本的先验知识，需要解决无需重新训练即可检测未见类别异常的问题。

Method: 提出三组件框架：1)字典构建-用正常参考图像特征模拟字典索引和内容；2)字典查找-通过稀疏查找策略检索查询区域特征，无法检索的特征被分类为异常；3)查询判别正则化-通过对比查询约束和文本对齐约束增强异常判别能力。

Result: 在7个工业和医学数据集上的大量实验表明，DictAS持续优于最先进的少样本异常分割方法。

Conclusion: DictAS通过自监督字典查找机制成功实现了无需重新训练的跨类别异常检测，为少样本异常分割提供了新的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have demonstrated remarkable
class-generalizable ability to unseen classes in few-shot anomaly segmentation
(FSAS), leveraging supervised prompt learning or fine-tuning on seen classes.
However, their cross-category generalization largely depends on prior knowledge
of real seen anomaly samples. In this paper, we propose a novel framework,
namely DictAS, which enables a unified model to detect visual anomalies in
unseen object categories without any retraining on the target data, only
employing a few normal reference images as visual prompts. The insight behind
DictAS is to transfer dictionary lookup capabilities to the FSAS task for
unseen classes via self-supervised learning, instead of merely memorizing the
normal and abnormal feature patterns from the training set. Specifically,
DictAS mainly consists of three components: (1) **Dictionary Construction** -
to simulate the index and content of a real dictionary using features from
normal reference images. (2) **Dictionary Lookup** - to retrieve queried region
features from the dictionary via a sparse lookup strategy. When a query feature
cannot be retrieved, it is classified as an anomaly. (3) **Query Discrimination
Regularization**- to enhance anomaly discrimination by making abnormal features
harder to retrieve from the dictionary. To achieve this, Contrastive Query
Constraint and Text Alignment Constraint are further proposed. Extensive
experiments on seven public industrial and medical datasets demonstrate that
DictAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FSAS methods.

Conclusion: 该方法成为了一个实用简单的基准方法，通过神经网络替代优化过程实现了重大的速度提升

Abstract: In 3D human pose and shape estimation, SMPLify remains a robust baseline that
solves inverse kinematics (IK) through iterative optimization. However, its
high computational cost limits its practicality. Recent advances across domains
have shown that replacing iterative optimization with data-driven neural
networks can achieve significant runtime improvements without sacrificing
accuracy. Motivated by this trend, we propose Learnable SMPLify, a neural
framework that replaces the iterative fitting process in SMPLify with a
single-pass regression model. The design of our framework targets two core
challenges in neural IK: data construction and generalization. To enable
effective training, we propose a temporal sampling strategy that constructs
initialization-target pairs from sequential frames. To improve generalization
across diverse motions and unseen poses, we propose a human-centric
normalization scheme and residual learning to narrow the solution space.
Learnable SMPLify supports both sequential inference and plug-in
post-processing to refine existing image-based estimators. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method establishes itself as a practical and
simple baseline: it achieves nearly 200x faster runtime compared to SMPLify,
generalizes well to unseen 3DPW and RICH, and operates in a model-agnostic
manner when used as a plug-in tool on LucidAction. The code is available at

Abstract: Video action analysis is a foundational technology within the realm of
intelligent video comprehension, particularly concerning its application in
Internet of Things(IoT). However, existing methodologies overlook feature
semantics in feature extraction and focus on optimizing action proposals, thus
these solutions are unsuitable for widespread adoption in high-performance IoT
applications due to the limitations in precision, such as autonomous driving,
which necessitate robust and scalable intelligent video analytics analysis. To
address this issue, we propose a novel generative attention-based model to
learn the relation of feature semantics. Specifically, by leveraging the
differences of actions' foreground and background, our model simultaneously
learns the frame- and segment-dependencies of temporal action feature
semantics, which takes advantage of feature semantics in the feature extraction
effectively. To evaluate the effectiveness of our model, we conduct extensive
experiments on two benchmark video task, action recognition and action
detection. In the context of action detection tasks, we substantiate the
superiority of our approach through comprehensive validation on widely
recognized datasets. Moreover, we extend the validation of the effectiveness of
our proposed method to a broader task, video action recognition. Our code is

Conclusion: 通过重新关注分割头设计和创新地结合扩散模型技术，可以在不增加复杂度的情况下显著提升引用视频对象分割的质量和准确性。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment specific objects
in a video according to textual descriptions. We observe that recent RVOS
approaches often place excessive emphasis on feature extraction and temporal
modeling, while relatively neglecting the design of the segmentation head. In
fact, there remains considerable room for improvement in segmentation head
design. To address this, we propose a Temporal-Conditional Referring Video
Object Segmentation model, which innovatively integrates existing segmentation
methods to effectively enhance boundary segmentation capability. Furthermore,
our model leverages a text-to-video diffusion model for feature extraction. On
top of this, we remove the traditional noise prediction module to avoid the
randomness of noise from degrading segmentation accuracy, thereby simplifying
the model while improving performance. Finally, to overcome the limited feature

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的域适应管道，将晴朗天气图像转换为雾、雨、雪和夜间图像，通过混合扩散-GAN方法生成逼真的恶劣天气图像，用于提升自动驾驶系统在恶劣环境下的感知性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶系统在恶劣环境条件下性能显著下降，而恶劣条件数据在现有数据集中代表性不足，获取和标注成本高昂，需要一种经济有效的解决方案。

Method: 开发了多种数据生成管道，包括纯模拟、GAN基和混合扩散-GAN方法，利用现有DA GAN并扩展支持辅助输入，结合模拟和真实图像训练，通过自适应混合方法减少Stable-Diffusion输出中的幻觉和伪影。

Result: 在ACDC数据集上，语义分割整体性能提升1.85%，夜间条件下提升4.62%，证明了混合方法在恶劣条件下提升自动驾驶感知鲁棒性的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的混合域适应管道能够有效生成逼真的恶劣天气图像，显著提升自动驾驶系统在挑战性环境条件下的感知性能，为解决恶劣天气数据稀缺问题提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Autonomous Driving (AD) systems exhibit markedly degraded performance under
adverse environmental conditions, such as low illumination and precipitation.
The underrepresentation of adverse conditions in AD datasets makes it
challenging to address this deficiency. To circumvent the prohibitive cost of
acquiring and annotating adverse weather data, we propose a novel Domain
Adaptation (DA) pipeline that transforms clear-weather images into fog, rain,
snow, and nighttime images. Here, we systematically develop and evaluate
several novel data-generation pipelines, including simulation-only, GAN-based,
and hybrid diffusion-GAN approaches, to synthesize photorealistic adverse
images from labelled clear images. We leverage an existing DA GAN, extend it to
support auxiliary inputs, and develop a novel training recipe that leverages
both simulated and real images. The simulated images facilitate exact
supervision by providing perfectly matched image pairs, while the real images
help bridge the simulation-to-real (sim2real) gap. We further introduce a
method to mitigate hallucinations and artifacts in Stable-Diffusion
Image-to-Image (img2img) outputs by blending them adaptively with their
progenitor images. We finetune downstream models on our synthetic data and
evaluate them on the Adverse Conditions Dataset with Correspondences (ACDC). We
achieve 1.85 percent overall improvement in semantic segmentation, and 4.62
percent on nighttime, demonstrating the efficacy of our hybrid method for
robust AD perception under challenging conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MaMe是一种专门为基于状态空间模型(SSM)的视觉模型设计的token合并策略，通过利用状态转移参数Δ量化token重要性并保持序列信息流，在保持性能的同时显著提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 状态空间模型在计算机视觉中表现出强大能力，但计算效率仍需提升。现有的token缩减方法应用于SSM时需要特别考虑其独特的序列建模能力。

Method: 提出MaMe策略：1) 使用状态转移参数Δ作为信息量度量指标来量化token重要性；2) 引入策略性token排列来保持序列信息流；3) 适用于微调模型和现成模型。

Result: 实验表明MaMe在效率-性能权衡方面表现优异，即使在激进的token缩减下也能保持鲁棒性，而现有方法会出现显著性能下降。在图像分类、视频和音频领域都展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: MaMe为提升SSM在不同应用中的效率提供了一种有效方法，通过专门针对SSM特性的token合并策略，实现了计算效率的显著提升而不牺牲性能。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as powerful architectures in computer
vision, yet improving their computational efficiency remains crucial for
practical and scalable deployment.While token reduction serves as an effective
approach for model efficiency, applying it to SSMs requires careful
consideration of their unique sequential modeling capabilities.In this work, we
propose MaMe, a token-merging strategy tailored for SSM-based vision
models.MaMe addresses two key challenges: quantifying token importance and
preserving sequential properties. Our approach leverages the state transition
parameter $\mathbf{\Delta}$ as an informativeness measure and introduces
strategic token arrangements to preserve sequential information flow.Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MaMe achieves superior efficiency-performance
trade-offs for both fine-tuned and off-the-shelf models. Particularly, our
approach maintains robustness even under aggressive token reduction where
existing methods undergo significant performance degradation.Beyond image
classification, MaMe shows strong generalization capabilities across video and
audio domains, establishing an effective approach for enhancing efficiency in
diverse SSM applications.

TL;DR: FoundationSSC是一个用于3D语义场景补全的新框架，通过源级别和路径级别的双重解耦设计，分别处理语义和几何信息，解决了现有方法中语义和几何需求冲突的问题，在多个数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于相机的3D语义场景补全方法使用耦合编码器同时处理语义和几何先验，这迫使模型在冲突需求之间做出权衡，限制了整体性能。

Method: 提出了FoundationSSC框架，采用双重解耦设计：源级别使用基础编码器分别提供语义特征先验和立体成本体积；路径级别通过专门的解耦路径精炼这些先验；使用混合视图变换生成互补的3D特征；引入轴感知融合模块对各向异性地融合特征。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI数据集上，语义指标提升+0.23 mIoU，几何指标提升+2.03 IoU；在SSCBench-KITTI-360数据集上达到21.78 mIoU和48.61 IoU的最先进性能。

Conclusion: 双重解耦设计能够有效解决语义和几何需求的冲突，通过专门的路径处理和创新的融合方法，在3D语义场景补全任务中实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Camera-based 3D semantic scene completion (SSC) provides dense geometric and
semantic perception for autonomous driving and robotic navigation. However,
existing methods rely on a coupled encoder to deliver both semantic and
geometric priors, which forces the model to make a trade-off between
conflicting demands and limits its overall performance. To tackle these
challenges, we propose FoundationSSC, a novel framework that performs dual
decoupling at both the source and pathway levels. At the source level, we
introduce a foundation encoder that provides rich semantic feature priors for
the semantic branch and high-fidelity stereo cost volumes for the geometric
branch. At the pathway level, these priors are refined through specialised,
decoupled pathways, yielding superior semantic context and depth distributions.
Our dual-decoupling design produces disentangled and refined inputs, which are
then utilised by a hybrid view transformation to generate complementary 3D
features. Additionally, we introduce a novel Axis-Aware Fusion (AAF) module
that addresses the often-overlooked challenge of fusing these features by
anisotropically merging them into a unified representation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the advantages of FoundationSSC, achieving simultaneous
improvements in both semantic and geometric metrics, surpassing prior bests by
+0.23 mIoU and +2.03 IoU on SemanticKITTI. Additionally, we achieve
state-of-the-art performance on SSCBench-KITTI-360, with 21.78 mIoU and 48.61
IoU. The code will be released upon acceptance.

*Tianyi Niu,Jaemin Cho,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Mohit Bansal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 多模态大语言模型在图片旋转识别任务中表现差强，尤其无法区分90度和270度旋转，显示了与人类视觉理解能力的显著差距


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估MLLM模型在图片旋转识别任务中的视觉理解能力，识别当前模型在空间理解方面的缺陷

Method: 构建RotBench测试集（350张图片），测试GPT-5、o3、Gemini-2.5-Pro等各种MLLM模型，使用提示工程、辅助信息、细调等方法来改善性能

Result: 模型能识别正常和倒立图片，但完全无法区分90度和270度旋转，各种改善方法只有小幅提升，细调也无法解决这一问题

Conclusion: MLLM模型在空间旋转理解方面存在重大缺陷，与人类视觉理解能力有显著差距，需要更深入的研究来解决这一根本性问题

Abstract: We investigate to what extent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can
accurately identify the orientation of input images rotated 0{\deg}, 90{\deg},
180{\deg}, and 270{\deg}. This task demands robust visual reasoning
capabilities to detect rotational cues and contextualize spatial relationships
within images, regardless of their orientation. To evaluate MLLMs on these
abilities, we introduce RotBench -- a 350-image manually-filtered benchmark
comprising lifestyle, portrait, and landscape images. Despite the relatively
simple nature of this task, we show that several state-of-the-art open and
proprietary MLLMs, including GPT-5, o3, and Gemini-2.5-Pro, do not reliably
identify rotation in input images. Providing models with auxiliary information
-- including captions, depth maps, and more -- or using chain-of-thought
prompting offers only small and inconsistent improvements. Our results indicate
that most models are able to reliably identify right-side-up (0{\deg}) images,
while certain models are able to identify upside-down (180{\deg}) images. None
can reliably distinguish between 90{\deg} and 270{\deg}. Simultaneously showing
the image rotated in different orientations leads to moderate performance gains
for reasoning models, while a modified setup using voting improves the
performance of weaker models. We further show that fine-tuning does not improve
models' ability to distinguish 90{\deg} and 270{\deg} rotations, despite
substantially improving the identification of 180{\deg} images. Together, these
results reveal a significant gap between MLLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities
and human perception in identifying rotation.

Abstract: With the growing demand for short videos and personalized content, automated
Video Log (Vlog) generation has become a key direction in multimodal content
creation. Existing methods mostly rely on predefined scripts, lacking dynamism
and personal expression. Therefore, there is an urgent need for an automated
Vlog generation approach that enables effective multimodal collaboration and
high personalization. To this end, we propose PersonaVlog, an automated
multimodal stylized Vlog generation framework that can produce personalized
Vlogs featuring videos, background music, and inner monologue speech based on a
given theme and reference image. Specifically, we propose a multi-agent
collaboration framework based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). This
framework efficiently generates high-quality prompts for multimodal content
creation based on user input, thereby improving the efficiency and creativity
of the process. In addition, we incorporate a feedback and rollback mechanism
that leverages MLLMs to evaluate and provide feedback on generated results,
thereby enabling iterative self-correction of multimodal content. We also
propose ThemeVlogEval, a theme-based automated benchmarking framework that
provides standardized metrics and datasets for fair evaluation. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate the significant advantages and potential of our
framework over several baselines, highlighting its effectiveness and great
potential for generating automated Vlogs.

Abstract: Face mask detection has become increasingly important recently, particularly
during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many face detection models have been developed in
smart entryways using IoT. However, there is a lack of IoT development on face
mask detection. This paper proposes a two-factor authentication system for
smart entryway access control using facial recognition and passcode
verification and an automation process to alert the owner and activate the
surveillance system when a stranger is detected and controls the system
remotely via Telegram on a Raspberry Pi platform. The system employs the Local
Binary Patterns Histograms for the full face recognition algorithm and modified
LBPH algorithm for occluded face detection. On average, the system achieved an
Accuracy of approximately 70%, a Precision of approximately 80%, and a Recall
of approximately 83.26% across all tested users. The results indicate that the
system is capable of conducting face recognition and mask detection, automating
the operation of the remote control to register users, locking or unlocking the
door, and notifying the owner. The sample participants highly accept it for
future use in the user acceptance test.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的音频驱动说话头合成模型在人类多样性（种族、语言、年龄）方面缺乏泛化能力，这主要源于训练数据在规模、质量和多样性方面的局限性。

Method: 通过多阶段自动化流水线精心筛选运动稳定性、美学质量和面部细节，构建TalkVid数据集，并创建分层评估集TalkVid-Bench（500个片段），在关键人口统计和语言维度上进行平衡。

Result: 在TalkVid上训练的模型优于在先前数据集上训练的模型，表现出更好的跨数据集泛化能力。TalkVid-Bench分析揭示了传统聚合指标掩盖的性能差异。

Conclusion: TalkVid数据集解决了音频驱动说话头合成的多样性泛化问题，TalkVid-Bench为未来研究提供了必要的评估基准，强调了考虑子群体性能差异的重要性。

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head synthesis has achieved remarkable photorealism, yet
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models exhibit a critical failure: they lack
generalization to the full spectrum of human diversity in ethnicity, language,
and age groups. We argue that this generalization gap is a direct symptom of
limitations in existing training data, which lack the necessary scale, quality,
and diversity. To address this challenge, we introduce TalkVid, a new
large-scale, high-quality, and diverse dataset containing 1244 hours of video
from 7729 unique speakers. TalkVid is curated through a principled, multi-stage
automated pipeline that rigorously filters for motion stability, aesthetic
quality, and facial detail, and is validated against human judgments to ensure
its reliability. Furthermore, we construct and release TalkVid-Bench, a
stratified evaluation set of 500 clips meticulously balanced across key
demographic and linguistic axes. Our experiments demonstrate that a model
trained on TalkVid outperforms counterparts trained on previous datasets,
exhibiting superior cross-dataset generalization. Crucially, our analysis on
TalkVid-Bench reveals performance disparities across subgroups that are
obscured by traditional aggregate metrics, underscoring its necessity for
future research. Code and data can be found in

Result: 在标准数据集上达到了高效率和超越以往RGB方法的精度

Conclusion: 该方法为仅使用RGB图像的类别级物体姿势估计提供了新的研究视角，在实际应用中具有重要价值

Abstract: While most current RGB-D-based category-level object pose estimation methods
achieve strong performance, they face significant challenges in scenes lacking
depth information. In this paper, we propose a novel category-level object pose
estimation approach that relies solely on RGB images. This method enables
accurate pose estimation in real-world scenarios without the need for depth
data. Specifically, we design a transformer-based neural network for
category-level object pose estimation, where the transformer is employed to
predict and fuse the geometric features of the target object. To ensure that
these predicted geometric features faithfully capture the object's geometry, we
introduce a geometric feature-guided algorithm, which enhances the network's
ability to effectively represent the object's geometric information. Finally,
we utilize the RANSAC-PnP algorithm to compute the object's pose, addressing
the challenges associated with variable object scales in pose estimation.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach is not
only highly efficient but also achieves superior accuracy compared to previous
RGB-based methods. These promising results offer a new perspective for
advancing category-level object pose estimation using RGB images.

Motivation: 扩散模型在CFG引导下生成高质量样本，但对引导权重选择非常敏感。研究发现存在训练-推理差距，这个差距影响了条件生成性能并导致输出对引导权重高度敏感。

Method: 提出DiffIER方法，一种基于优化的高质量生成方法。通过在每个推理步骤进行迭代误差最小化来有效减少累积误差，采用即插即用的优化框架。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在条件生成任务中优于基线方法，在文本到图像生成、图像超分辨率和文本到语音生成等多个领域都取得了成功。

Conclusion: DiffIER方法能够有效缓解训练-推理差距，提高生成质量，具有广泛的适用性和在未来研究中的应用潜力。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating
high-quality samples and enhancing performance across diverse domains through
Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG). However, the quality of generated samples is
highly sensitive to the selection of the guidance weight. In this work, we
identify a critical ``training-inference gap'' and we argue that it is the
presence of this gap that undermines the performance of conditional generation
and renders outputs highly sensitive to the guidance weight. We quantify this
gap by measuring the accumulated error during the inference stage and establish
a correlation between the selection of guidance weight and minimizing this gap.
Furthermore, to mitigate this gap, we propose DiffIER, an optimization-based
method for high-quality generation. We demonstrate that the accumulated error
can be effectively reduced by an iterative error minimization at each step
during inference. By introducing this novel plug-and-play optimization
framework, we enable the optimization of errors at every single inference step
and enhance generation quality. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed
method outperforms baseline approaches in conditional generation tasks.
Furthermore, the method achieves consistent success in text-to-image
generation, image super-resolution, and text-to-speech generation, underscoring
its versatility and potential for broad applications in future research.

Method: 两阶段训练流程：第一阶段利用大规模未配对图像训练无掩码定位模型，通过重用途修复模型自动定位物品；第二阶段用少量配对图像微调，保持物品外观一致性。

Result: 在包含12类常见可穿戴物品的综合基准测试中，OmniTry在物品定位和ID保持方面均优于现有方法，且第一阶段后模型收敛快速。

Conclusion: OmniTry成功扩展了虚拟试穿的应用范围，为任意可穿戴物品提供了有效的无掩码试穿解决方案，代码和基准测试将开源。

Abstract: Virtual Try-ON (VTON) is a practical and widely-applied task, for which most
of existing works focus on clothes. This paper presents OmniTry, a unified
framework that extends VTON beyond garment to encompass any wearable objects,
e.g., jewelries and accessories, with mask-free setting for more practical
application. When extending to various types of objects, data curation is
challenging for obtaining paired images, i.e., the object image and the
corresponding try-on result. To tackle this problem, we propose a two-staged
pipeline: For the first stage, we leverage large-scale unpaired images, i.e.,
portraits with any wearable items, to train the model for mask-free
localization. Specifically, we repurpose the inpainting model to automatically
draw objects in suitable positions given an empty mask. For the second stage,
the model is further fine-tuned with paired images to transfer the consistency
of object appearance. We observed that the model after the first stage shows
quick convergence even with few paired samples. OmniTry is evaluated on a
comprehensive benchmark consisting of 12 common classes of wearable objects,
with both in-shop and in-the-wild images. Experimental results suggest that
OmniTry shows better performance on both object localization and
ID-preservation compared with existing methods. The code, model weights, and
evaluation benchmark of OmniTry will be made publicly available at

Conclusion: DeH4R通过混合架构成功解决了路网提取中的拓扑保真性与计算效率的争议，实现了高效、动态且精确的路网图提取

Abstract: The automated extraction of complete and precise road network graphs from
remote sensing imagery remains a critical challenge in geospatial computer
vision. Segmentation-based approaches, while effective in pixel-level
recognition, struggle to maintain topology fidelity after vectorization
postprocessing. Graph-growing methods build more topologically faithful graphs
but suffer from computationally prohibitive iterative ROI cropping.
Graph-generating methods first predict global static candidate road network
vertices, and then infer possible edges between vertices. They achieve fast
topology-aware inference, but limits the dynamic insertion of vertices. To
address these challenges, we propose DeH4R, a novel hybrid model that combines
graph-generating efficiency and graph-growing dynamics. This is achieved by
decoupling the task into candidate vertex detection, adjacent vertex
prediction, initial graph contruction, and graph expansion. This architectural
innovation enables dynamic vertex (edge) insertions while retaining fast
inference speed and enhancing both topology fidelity and spatial consistency.
Comprehensive evaluations on CityScale and SpaceNet benchmarks demonstrate
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. DeH4R outperforms the prior SOTA
graph-growing method RNGDet++ by 4.62 APLS and 10.18 IoU on CityScale, while
being approximately 10 $\times$ faster. The code will be made publicly
available at https://github.com/7777777FAN/DeH4R.

Abstract: The aspiration for artificial general intelligence, fueled by the rapid
progress of multimodal models, demands human-comparable performance across
diverse environments. We propose HumanPCR, an evaluation suite for probing
MLLMs' capacity about human-related visual contexts across three hierarchical
levels: Perception, Comprehension, and Reasoning (denoted by Human-P, Human-C,
and Human-R, respectively). Human-P and Human-C feature over 6,000
human-verified multiple choice questions, assessing massive tasks of 9
dimensions, including but not limited to essential skills frequently overlooked
by existing benchmarks. Human-R offers a challenging manually curated video
reasoning test that requires integrating multiple visual evidences, proactively
extracting context beyond question cues, and applying human-like expertise.
Each question includes human-annotated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales with
key visual evidence to support further research. Extensive evaluations on over
30 state-of-the-art models exhibit significant challenges in human-centric
visual understanding, particularly in tasks involving detailed space
perception, temporal understanding, and mind modeling. Moreover, analysis of
Human-R reveals the struggle of models in extracting essential proactive visual
evidence from diverse human scenes and their faulty reliance on query-guided
retrieval. Even with advanced techniques like scaling visual contexts and
test-time thinking yield only limited benefits. We hope HumanPCR and our
findings will advance the development, evaluation, and human-centric
application of multimodal models.

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality annotated data for medical image segmentation is
tedious and costly. Semi-supervised segmentation techniques alleviate this
burden by leveraging unlabeled data to generate pseudo labels. Recently,
advanced state space models, represented by Mamba, have shown efficient
handling of long-range dependencies. This drives us to explore their potential

novel Diversity-enhanced Collaborative Mamba framework (namely DCMamba) for
semi-supervised medical image segmentation, which explores and utilizes the
diversity from data, network, and feature perspectives. Firstly, from the data
perspective, we develop patch-level weak-strong mixing augmentation with
Mamba's scanning modeling characteristics. Moreover, from the network
perspective, we introduce a diverse-scan collaboration module, which could
benefit from the prediction discrepancies arising from different scanning
directions. Furthermore, from the feature perspective, we adopt an
uncertainty-weighted contrastive learning mechanism to enhance the diversity of
feature representation. Experiments demonstrate that our DCMamba significantly
outperforms other semi-supervised medical image segmentation methods, e.g.,
yielding the latest SSM-based method by 6.69% on the Synapse dataset with 20%
labeled data.

*Ali Abdari,Alex Falcon,Giuseppe Serra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个农业主题虚拟博物馆数据集和分层视觉语言模型，用于基于自然语言查询的元宇宙场景检索，在农业教育内容组织方面取得了显著效果提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线教育内容快速增长但缺乏有效组织方式，元宇宙为教育内容提供了沉浸式交互环境，但现有数据集规模小且检索技术不足，无法满足用户精准查找相关元宇宙场景的需求。

Method: 构建了包含457个农业主题虚拟博物馆(AgriMuseums)的新数据集，每个都带有文本描述；提出了分层视觉语言模型来表示和检索相关的农业虚拟博物馆。

Result: 所提方法达到了约62%的R@1和78%的MRR，在现有基准上提升了6%的R@1和11%的MRR，验证了设计选择的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究为农业教育元宇宙内容检索提供了有效解决方案，数据集和代码已开源，有助于推动相关领域发展。

Abstract: Every day, a large amount of educational content is uploaded online across
different areas, including agriculture and gardening. When these videos or
materials are grouped meaningfully, they can make learning easier and more
effective. One promising way to organize and enrich such content is through the
Metaverse, which allows users to explore educational experiences in an
interactive and immersive environment. However, searching for relevant
Metaverse scenarios and finding those matching users' interests remains a
challenging task. A first step in this direction has been done recently, but
existing datasets are small and not sufficient for training advanced models. In
this work, we make two main contributions: first, we introduce a new dataset
containing 457 agricultural-themed virtual museums (AgriMuseums), each enriched
with textual descriptions; and second, we propose a hierarchical
vision-language model to represent and retrieve relevant AgriMuseums using
natural language queries. In our experimental setting, the proposed method
achieves up to about 62\% R@1 and 78\% MRR, confirming its effectiveness, and
it also leads to improvements on existing benchmarks by up to 6\% R@1 and 11\%
MRR. Moreover, an extensive evaluation validates our design choices. Code and

*Yiming Cao,Yanjie Li,Kaisheng Liang,Yuni Lai,Bin Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了IPGA攻击方法，通过利用投影器模块的中间阶段（Q-Former）进行更精细的对抗攻击，解决了现有方法在视觉语言模型中全局向量表示限制和忽略投影器模块的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法将丰富的视觉语义压缩为单一全局向量，限制了攻击粒度，且忽视了投影器模块在视觉语言对齐中的关键作用，导致攻击效果受限。

Method: IPGA方法利用投影器模块（Q-Former）的中间阶段进行攻击，将全局图像嵌入转换为细粒度视觉特征，并提出了残差查询对齐（RQA）来保护无关视觉内容。

Result: 实验表明IPGA在全局图像描述和细粒度视觉问答任务中均优于现有方法，并能成功迁移到多个商业VLM（如Google Gemini和OpenAI GPT）。

Conclusion: IPGA通过关注投影器模块的中间表示，实现了更精确和可控的对抗攻击，显著提升了攻击效果和跨模型迁移能力。

Abstract: Targeted adversarial attacks are essential for proactively identifying
security flaws in Vision-Language Models before real-world deployment. However,
current methods perturb images to maximize global similarity with the target
text or reference image at the encoder level, collapsing rich visual semantics
into a single global vector. This limits attack granularity, hindering
fine-grained manipulations such as modifying a car while preserving its
background. Furthermore, these methods largely overlook the projector module, a
critical semantic bridge between the visual encoder and the language model in
VLMs, thereby failing to disrupt the full vision-language alignment pipeline
within VLMs and limiting attack effectiveness. To address these issues, we
propose the Intermediate Projector Guided Attack (IPGA), the first method to
attack using the intermediate stage of the projector module, specifically the
widely adopted Q-Former, which transforms global image embeddings into
fine-grained visual features. This enables more precise control over
adversarial perturbations by operating on semantically meaningful visual tokens
rather than a single global representation. Specifically, IPGA leverages the
Q-Former pretrained solely on the first vision-language alignment stage,
without LLM fine-tuning, which improves both attack effectiveness and
transferability across diverse VLMs. Furthermore, we propose Residual Query
Alignment (RQA) to preserve unrelated visual content, thereby yielding more
controlled and precise adversarial manipulations. Extensive experiments show
that our attack method consistently outperforms existing methods in both
standard global image captioning tasks and fine-grained visual
question-answering tasks in black-box environment. Additionally, IPGA
successfully transfers to multiple commercial VLMs, including Google Gemini and
OpenAI GPT.

*Yeji Park,Minyoung Lee,Sanghyuk Chun,Junsuk Choe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FOCUS是一种无需训练的解码策略，通过顺序掩码图像来缓解多图像输入时的信息泄漏问题，显著提升多图像推理性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在单图像任务上表现良好，但在处理多图像输入时性能显著下降，因为不同图像的视觉线索在模型输出中相互纠缠，存在跨图像信息泄漏问题

Method: 提出FOCUS解码策略：1）顺序用随机噪声掩码除一张图像外的所有图像；2）重复此过程获得所有目标图像的部分掩码上下文下的logits；3）聚合logits并使用纯噪声参考输入进行对比精炼，抑制信息泄漏

Result: FOCUS在四个多图像基准测试和多种LVLM模型家族中一致提升性能

Conclusion: FOCUS提供了一种通用实用的解决方案，无需额外训练或架构修改即可增强多图像推理能力

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong performance on
single-image tasks. However, we observe that their performance degrades
significantly when handling multi-image inputs. This occurs because visual cues
from different images become entangled in the model's output. We refer to this
phenomenon as cross-image information leakage. To address this issue, we
propose FOCUS, a training-free and architecture-agnostic decoding strategy that
mitigates cross-image information leakage during inference. FOCUS sequentially
masks all but one image with random noise, guiding the model to focus on the
single clean image. We repeat this process across all target images to obtain
logits under partially masked contexts. These logits are aggregated and then
contrastively refined using a noise-only reference input, which suppresses the
leakage and yields more accurate outputs. FOCUS consistently improves
performance across four multi-image benchmarks and diverse LVLM families. This
demonstrates that FOCUS offers a general and practical solution for enhancing
multi-image reasoning without additional training or architectural
modifications.

TL;DR: MR6D是一个专为移动机器人设计的6D姿态估计数据集，针对工业环境中大型物体的远距离感知、严重自遮挡和多样化视角等挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的6D姿态估计数据集主要关注机器人臂操作的小型家用物体，无法满足移动机器人在工业环境中的需求，包括远距离感知、大型物体交互和复杂遮挡等问题。

Method: 创建包含92个真实场景的数据集，涵盖16个独特物体，包含静态和动态交互场景，特别捕捉移动平台特有的挑战如远距离视角、多样化物体配置和复杂遮挡模式。

Result: 初步实验显示当前6D姿态估计流程在这些场景下表现不佳，2D分割成为另一个主要障碍。

Conclusion: MR6D为开发和评估面向移动机器人需求的姿态估计方法奠定了基础，填补了现有数据集的空白。

Abstract: Existing 6D pose estimation datasets primarily focus on small household
objects typically handled by robot arm manipulators, limiting their relevance
to mobile robotics. Mobile platforms often operate without manipulators,
interact with larger objects, and face challenges such as long-range
perception, heavy self-occlusion, and diverse camera perspectives. While recent
models generalize well to unseen objects, evaluations remain confined to
household-like settings that overlook these factors. We introduce MR6D, a
dataset designed for 6D pose estimation for mobile robots in industrial
environments. It includes 92 real-world scenes featuring 16 unique objects
across static and dynamic interactions. MR6D captures the challenges specific
to mobile platforms, including distant viewpoints, varied object
configurations, larger object sizes, and complex occlusion/self-occlusion
patterns. Initial experiments reveal that current 6D pipelines underperform in
these settings, with 2D segmentation being another hurdle. MR6D establishes a
foundation for developing and evaluating pose estimation methods tailored to
the demands of mobile robotics. The dataset is available at

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的多相机系统下的3D形状到2D关键点的非粘性注册方法，通过普通相机模型和凸规划等技术实现了更高精度的变形体重建。


<details>

Motivation: 将多相机信息结合到形状模板重建（SfT）中，以扩大医学成像和手持相机等应用场景的范围，利用多视角相互约束提高重建精度。

Method: 使用普通相机模型表示多相机系统，提出三种方法：知道3D点的方向向量法、未知点但知方向的方法、以及结合边缘信息的方法。采用凸规划求解对应关系方法，边缘方法则通过迭代精化。

Result: 在合成和实际数据上验证了方法的准确性，成为普通相机SfT问题的首批解决方案。

Conclusion: 该方法通过多相机系统的相互约束显著提升了非粘性3D形状注册的精度，为医学成像等领域提供了更强大的工具。

Abstract: This article presents a new method for non-rigidly registering a 3D shape to
2D keypoints observed by a constellation of multiple cameras. Non-rigid
registration of a 3D shape to observed 2D keypoints, i.e., Shape-from-Template
(SfT), has been widely studied using single images, but SfT with information
from multiple-cameras jointly opens new directions for extending the scope of
known use-cases such as 3D shape registration in medical imaging and
registration from hand-held cameras, to name a few. We represent such
multi-camera setup with the generalised camera model; therefore any collection
of perspective or orthographic cameras observing any deforming object can be
registered. We propose multiple approaches for such SfT: the first approach
where the corresponded keypoints lie on a direction vector from a known 3D
point in space, the second approach where the corresponded keypoints lie on a
direction vector from an unknown 3D point in space but with known orientation
w.r.t some local reference frame, and a third approach where, apart from
correspondences, the silhouette of the imaged object is also known. Together,
these form the first set of solutions to the SfT problem with generalised
cameras. The key idea behind SfT with generalised camera is the improved
reconstruction accuracy from estimating deformed shape while utilising the
additional information from the mutual constraints between multiple views of a
deformed object. The correspondence-based approaches are solved with convex
programming while the silhouette-based approach is an iterative refinement of
the results from the convex solutions. We demonstrate the accuracy of our
proposed methods on many synthetic and real data

TL;DR: VisionLaw是一个双层优化框架，通过视觉观察推断可解释的内在动力学表达式，使用LLM生成物理定律并结合视觉模拟评估，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么依赖手动定义的本构先验难以泛化到复杂场景，要么使用神经网络导致可解释性差和泛化能力有限，需要新的解决方案。

Method: 提出双层优化框架：上层使用LLM作为物理专家生成和修订本构定律，下层通过视觉模拟评估生成定律与内在动力学的一致性。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，VisionLaw能有效从视觉观察中推断可解释的内在动力学，显著优于现有SOTA方法，在新场景中表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: VisionLaw成功解决了内在动力学推断的可解释性和泛化性问题，为物理交互模拟提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The intrinsic dynamics of an object governs its physical behavior in the real
world, playing a critical role in enabling physically plausible interactive
simulation with 3D assets. Existing methods have attempted to infer the
intrinsic dynamics of objects from visual observations, but generally face two
major challenges: one line of work relies on manually defined constitutive
priors, making it difficult to generalize to complex scenarios; the other
models intrinsic dynamics using neural networks, resulting in limited
interpretability and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we
propose VisionLaw, a bilevel optimization framework that infers interpretable
expressions of intrinsic dynamics from visual observations. At the upper level,
we introduce an LLMs-driven decoupled constitutive evolution strategy, where
LLMs are prompted as a knowledgeable physics expert to generate and revise
constitutive laws, with a built-in decoupling mechanism that substantially
reduces the search complexity of LLMs. At the lower level, we introduce a
vision-guided constitutive evaluation mechanism, which utilizes visual
simulation to evaluate the consistency between the generated constitutive law
and the underlying intrinsic dynamics, thereby guiding the upper-level
evolution. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that VisionLaw can effectively infer interpretable intrinsic dynamics from
visual observations. It significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods and exhibits strong generalization for interactive simulation in novel
scenarios.

Motivation: 提高乳腺癌超声分割的准确性和可解释性，通过整合临床文本信息来增强模型的可信度和透明度，为计算机辅助诊断提供更可靠的解决方案。

Method: 使用双分支视觉编码器（ViT+Swin Transformer）和不确定性感知融合，结合BioClinicalBERT编码的BI-RADS临床语言，通过跨模态注意力机制融合多模态特征。

Result: 在BUS-BRA数据集上达到Dice 99%和IoU 95%，超越U-Net、ViT和Swin等基线方法。消融研究表明临床文本对分割精度和解释质量至关重要。

Conclusion: Med-CTX为可信赖的多模态医学架构设立了新标准，通过同时生成分割掩码、不确定性图和诊断理由，显著提升了计算机辅助诊断的信心和透明度。

Abstract: We introduce Med-CTX, a fully transformer based multimodal framework for
explainable breast cancer ultrasound segmentation. We integrate clinical
radiology reports to boost both performance and interpretability. Med-CTX
achieves exact lesion delineation by using a dual-branch visual encoder that
combines ViT and Swin transformers, as well as uncertainty aware fusion.
Clinical language structured with BI-RADS semantics is encoded by
BioClinicalBERT and combined with visual features utilising cross-modal
attention, allowing the model to provide clinically grounded, model generated
explanations. Our methodology generates segmentation masks, uncertainty maps,
and diagnostic rationales all at once, increasing confidence and transparency
in computer assisted diagnosis. On the BUS-BRA dataset, Med-CTX achieves a Dice
score of 99% and an IoU of 95%, beating existing baselines U-Net, ViT, and
Swin. Clinical text plays a key role in segmentation accuracy and explanation
quality, as evidenced by ablation studies that show a -5.4% decline in Dice
score and -31% in CIDEr. Med-CTX achieves good multimodal alignment (CLIP
score: 85%) and increased confi dence calibration (ECE: 3.2%), setting a new
bar for trustworthy, multimodal medical architecture.

TL;DR: 提出TCA框架，通过时间步压缩显著降低SNN对抗攻击延迟，相比SOTA方法减少56.6-57.1%延迟，同时保持相近攻击成功率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于梯度的SNN对抗攻击方法存在严重延迟问题，无法满足实时应用需求，这些方法直接扩展ANN范式，未能充分利用SNN特性

Method: TCA框架包含两个核心组件：1) 时间步级反向传播(TLBP)，基于发现全局时序信息对攻击成功非关键，支持逐时间步评估和早期停止；2) 对抗性膜电位重用(A-MPR)，利用初始时间步膜电位积累可预计算重用的特性

Result: 在VGG-11和ResNet-17上，使用CIFAR-10/100和CIFAR10-DVS数据集测试，TCA在白盒和黑盒设置下分别减少56.6%和57.1%攻击延迟，攻击成功率与SOTA方法相当

Conclusion: TCA通过有效利用SNN特性显著降低了对抗攻击延迟，为SNN在实时应用中的安全部署提供了可行解决方案

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) gradient-based adversarial attacks on spiking neural
networks (SNNs), which largely rely on extending FGSM and PGD frameworks, face
a critical limitation: substantial attack latency from multi-timestep
processing, rendering them infeasible for practical real-time applications.
This inefficiency stems from their design as direct extensions of ANN
paradigms, which fail to exploit key SNN properties. In this paper, we propose
the timestep-compressed attack (TCA), a novel framework that significantly
reduces attack latency. TCA introduces two components founded on key insights
into SNN behavior. First, timestep-level backpropagation (TLBP) is based on our
finding that global temporal information in backpropagation to generate
perturbations is not critical for an attack's success, enabling per-timestep
evaluation for early stopping. Second, adversarial membrane potential reuse
(A-MPR) is motivated by the observation that initial timesteps are
inefficiently spent accumulating membrane potential, a warm-up phase that can
be pre-calculated and reused. Our experiments on VGG-11 and ResNet-17 with the
CIFAR-10/100 and CIFAR10-DVS datasets show that TCA significantly reduces the
required attack latency by up to 56.6% and 57.1% compared to SOTA methods in
white-box and black-box settings, respectively, while maintaining a comparable
attack success rate.

<details>

Motivation: 城市树木生物多样性对气候适应性和生态稳定性至关重要，但现有调查方法成本高、耗时长，而监督学习方法需要标签数据且空间移植性差。

Method: 提出一种无监督聚类框架，结合街道级图像的视觉嵌入和空间植装模式，在不需要标签的情况下估算生物多样性。

Result: 在八个北美城市的应用显示，该方法能够高保真度地恢复属级多样性模式，对Shannon和Simpson指数获得低Wasserstein距离，并保持空间自相关性。

Conclusion: 该可扩展的细粒度方法为缺乏详细调查的城市提供了生物多样性制图能力，支持低成本连续监测，促进绿化许可平等和城市生态系统的适应性管理。

Abstract: Urban tree biodiversity is critical for climate resilience, ecological
stability, and livability in cities, yet most municipalities lack detailed
knowledge of their canopies. Field-based inventories provide reliable estimates
of Shannon and Simpson diversity but are costly and time-consuming, while
supervised AI methods require labeled data that often fail to generalize across
regions. We introduce an unsupervised clustering framework that integrates
visual embeddings from street-level imagery with spatial planting patterns to
estimate biodiversity without labels. Applied to eight North American cities,
the method recovers genus-level diversity patterns with high fidelity,
achieving low Wasserstein distances to ground truth for Shannon and Simpson
indices and preserving spatial autocorrelation. This scalable, fine-grained
approach enables biodiversity mapping in cities lacking detailed inventories
and offers a pathway for continuous, low-cost monitoring to support equitable
access to greenery and adaptive management of urban ecosystems.

Conclusion: SA3方法通过高效的对齐机制和识别策略，成功地解决了跨域对象检测中的挑战，为智能交通检测领域提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Achieving top-notch performance in Intelligent Transportation detection is a
critical research area. However, many challenges still need to be addressed
when it comes to detecting in a cross-domain scenario. In this paper, we
propose a Self-Aware Adaptive Alignment (SA3), by leveraging an efficient
alignment mechanism and recognition strategy. Our proposed method employs a
specified attention-based alignment module trained on source and target domain
datasets to guide the image-level features alignment process, enabling the
local-global adaptive alignment between the source domain and target domain.
Features from both domains, whose channel importance is re-weighted, are fed
into the region proposal network, which facilitates the acquisition of salient
region features. Also, we introduce an instance-to-image level alignment module
specific to the target domain to adaptively mitigate the domain gap. To
evaluate the proposed method, extensive experiments have been conducted on
popular cross-domain object detection benchmarks. Experimental results show
that SA3 achieves superior results to the previous state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型虽然视觉效果优秀，但常常无法精确对齐文本提示，导致缺失关键元素或产生意外的概念混合

Method: 学习一个高成功率的分布，在去噪过程中显式建模信号分量，提供细粒度控制，该方法无需训练且可以无缝集成到现有扩散和流匹配架构中

Result: 大量实验证明该方法在性能上超过了当前最先进的方法

Conclusion: 该框架能够生成更准确对齐文本提示的图像，同时支持附加条件如边框来实现更好的空间对齐

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models produce visually impressive results but
often struggle with precise alignment to text prompts, leading to missing
critical elements or unintended blending of distinct concepts. We propose a
novel approach that learns a high-success-rate distribution conditioned on a
target prompt, ensuring that generated images faithfully reflect the
corresponding prompts. Our method explicitly models the signal component during
the denoising process, offering fine-grained control that mitigates
over-optimization and out-of-distribution artifacts. Moreover, our framework is
training-free and seamlessly integrates with both existing diffusion and flow
matching architectures. It also supports additional conditioning modalities --
such as bounding boxes -- for enhanced spatial alignment. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. The

Motivation: 传统石材劣化模式识别依赖专家团队直接观察，虽然准确但耗时耗力，需要开发自动化解决方案来提高效率。

Method: 采用基于认知架构的多智能体系统，包含5个专业AI代理：岩相学家、病理学家、环境专家、修复师和诊断协调员，协同分析视觉证据。

Result: 在28个包含多种劣化模式的困难图像测试中，系统在所有指标上都相比基础模型有显著提升。

assist in the identification of stone deterioration patterns. Traditional
methodologies, based on direct observation by expert teams, are accurate but
costly in terms of time and resources. The system developed here introduces and
evaluates a multi-agent artificial intelligence (AI) system, designed to
simulate collaboration between experts and automate the diagnosis of stone
pathologies from visual evidence. The approach is based on a cognitive
architecture that orchestrates a team of specialized AI agents which, in this
specific case, are limited to five: a lithologist, a pathologist, an
environmental expert, a conservator-restorer, and a diagnostic coordinator. To
evaluate the system we selected 28 difficult images involving multiple
deterioration patterns. Our first results showed a huge boost on all metrics of

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前增量学习评估多使用综合的简化基准，隐藏了现实世界中的性能问题。需要更现实的评估标准来揭示真实性能。

Method: 构建了两个现实增量学习目标检测基准(RICO)：D-RICO(域移动但类别固定)和EC-RICO(每步增加新域和新类别)。基于14个多样化数据集，涵盖真实和综合域、不同条件(天气、时间)、相机传感器、视角和标注策略。

Result: 所有增量学习方法在适应性和知识保持方面都表现差强。回放少量历史数据就能超过所有方法，但仍较单独训练差强。

Conclusion: 现有增量学习方法在现实场景下存在显著稽差，应归因于识别教学中的弱老师、单一模型无法处理多样任务以及不足的可塑性。需要更有效的方法来应对现实增量学习挑战。

Abstract: Incremental Learning (IL) trains models sequentially on new data without full
retraining, offering privacy, efficiency, and scalability. IL must balance
adaptability to new data with retention of old knowledge. However, evaluations
often rely on synthetic, simplified benchmarks, obscuring real-world IL
performance. To address this, we introduce two Realistic Incremental Object
Detection Benchmarks (RICO): Domain RICO (D-RICO) features domain shifts with a
fixed class set, and Expanding-Classes RICO (EC-RICO) integrates new domains
and classes per IL step. Built from 14 diverse datasets covering real and
synthetic domains, varying conditions (e.g., weather, time of day), camera
sensors, perspectives, and labeling policies, both benchmarks capture
challenges absent in existing evaluations. Our experiments show that all IL
methods underperform in adaptability and retention, while replaying a small
amount of previous data already outperforms all methods. However, individual
training on the data remains superior. We heuristically attribute this gap to
weak teachers in distillation, single models' inability to manage diverse
tasks, and insufficient plasticity. Our code will be made publicly available.

Representations (LCRs) (e.g., Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs)) to guide
models toward semantically grounded representations. LCRReg requires no concept
labels in the main training set and instead uses a small auxiliary dataset to
synthesise high-quality, disentangled concept examples. We extract LCRs for
predefined relevant features, and incorporate a regularisation term that guides
a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to activate within latent subspaces
associated with those concepts. We evaluate LCRReg across synthetic and
real-world medical tasks. On a controlled toy dataset, it significantly
improves robustness to injected spurious correlations and remains effective
even in multi-concept and multiclass settings. On the diabetic retinopathy
binary classification task, LCRReg enhances performance under both synthetic
spurious perturbations and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation. Compared
to baselines, including multitask learning, linear probing, and post-hoc
concept-based models, LCRReg offers a lightweight, architecture-agnostic
strategy for improving model robustness without requiring dense concept
supervision. Code is available at the following link:

TL;DR: 单元格LSTM模型预测南亚霜霾氮化物指数，五天预测准确度高


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 南亚地区年度霜霾事件严重影响生态和经济，但缺乏区域性实时预注系统

Method: 使用Sentinel-5P数据(2019-2023)和ConvLSTM神经网络，通过累积空间时间相关性预测氮化物指数

Result: 五天间隔预测均方误差~0.0018，损失~0.3995，结构相似性指数~0.74

Conclusion: 模型预测效果良好，但需整合更多数据和优化等级来提升性能

Abstract: The South Asian Smog refers to the recurring annual air pollution events
marked by high contaminant levels, reduced visibility, and significant
socio-economic impacts, primarily affecting the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) from
November to February. Over the past decade, increased air pollution sources
such as crop residue burning, motor vehicles, and changing weather patterns
have intensified these smog events. However, real-time forecasting systems for
increased particulate matter concentrations are still not established at
regional scale. The Aerosol Index, closely tied to smog formation and a key
component in calculating the Air Quality Index (AQI), reflects particulate
matter concentrations. This study forecasts aerosol events using Sentinel-5P
air constituent data (2019-2023) and a Convolutional Long-Short Term Memory
(ConvLSTM) neural network, which captures spatial and temporal correlations
more effectively than previous models. Using the Ultraviolet (UV) Aerosol Index
at 340-380 nm as the predictor, results show the Aerosol Index can be
forecasted at five-day intervals with a Mean Squared Error of ~0.0018, loss of
~0.3995, and Structural Similarity Index of ~0.74. While effective, the model
can be improved by integrating additional data and refining its architecture.

Conclusion: 所提出的SCRNet框架通过有效地结合局部和全局信息，在医学超声图像分割领域表现出艰强的性能优势，为该领域的研究提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical ultrasound image segmentation presents a formidable challenge in the
realm of computer vision. Traditional approaches rely on Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based methods to address the intricacies of
medical image segmentation. Nevertheless, inherent limitations persist, as
CNN-based methods tend to disregard long-range dependencies, while
Transformer-based methods may overlook local contextual information. To address
these deficiencies, we propose a novel Feature Aggregation Module (FAM)
designed to process two input features from the preceding layer. These features
are seamlessly directed into two branches of the Convolution and
Cross-Attention Parallel Module (CCAPM) to endow them with different roles in
each of the two branches to help establish a strong connection between the two
input features. This strategy enables our module to focus concurrently on both
long-range dependencies and local contextual information by judiciously merging
convolution operations with cross-attention mechanisms. Moreover, by
integrating FAM within our proposed Spatial-Channel Regulation Module (SCRM),
the ability to discern salient regions and informative features warranting
increased attention is enhanced. Furthermore, by incorporating the SCRM into
the encoder block of the UNet architecture, we introduce a novel framework
dubbed Spatial-Channel Regulation Network (SCRNet). The results of our
extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of SCRNet, which consistently
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: While physics-grounded 3D motion synthesis has seen significant progress,
current methods face critical limitations. They typically rely on
pre-reconstructed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representations, while physics
integration depends on either inflexible, manually defined physical attributes
or unstable, optimization-heavy guidance from video models. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce PhysGM, a feed-forward framework that jointly predicts
a 3D Gaussian representation and its physical properties from a single image,
enabling immediate, physical simulation and high-fidelity 4D rendering. We
first establish a base model by jointly optimizing for Gaussian reconstruction
and probabilistic physics prediction. The model is then refined with physically
plausible reference videos to enhance both rendering fidelity and physics
prediction accuracy. We adopt the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align
its simulations with reference videos, circumventing Score Distillation
Sampling (SDS) optimization which needs back-propagating gradients through the
complex differentiable simulation and rasterization. To facilitate the
training, we introduce a new dataset PhysAssets of over 24,000 3D assets,
annotated with physical properties and corresponding guiding videos.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively generates
high-fidelity 4D simulations from a single image in one minute. This represents
a significant speedup over prior works while delivering realistic rendering
results. Our project page is at:https://hihixiaolv.github.io/PhysGM.github.io/

Conclusion: DIME-Net框架在多样化复杂光照条件下具有实际多媒体应用的潜力，能够统一处理多种光照退化问题

Abstract: Image degradation caused by complex lighting conditions such as low-light and
backlit scenarios is commonly encountered in real-world environments,
significantly affecting image quality and downstream vision tasks. Most
existing methods focus on a single type of illumination degradation and lack
the ability to handle diverse lighting conditions in a unified manner. To
address this issue, we propose a dual-illumination enhancement framework called
DIME-Net. The core of our method is a Mixture-of-Experts illumination estimator
module, where a sparse gating mechanism adaptively selects suitable S-curve
expert networks based on the illumination characteristics of the input image.
By integrating Retinex theory, this module effectively performs enhancement
tailored to both low-light and backlit images. To further correct
illumination-induced artifacts and color distortions, we design a damage
restoration module equipped with Illumination-Aware Cross Attention and
Sequential-State Global Attention mechanisms. In addition, we construct a
hybrid illumination dataset, MixBL, by integrating existing datasets, allowing
our model to achieve robust illumination adaptability through a single training
process. Experimental results show that DIME-Net achieves competitive
performance on both synthetic and real-world low-light and backlit datasets
without any retraining. These results demonstrate its generalization ability
and potential for practical multimedia applications under diverse and complex
illumination conditions.

Motivation: 当前人脸图像质量评估方法主要依赖卷积神经网络，而Vision Transformer架构的潜力尚未被充分探索，需要开发基于Transformer的FIQA方法。

Method: 扩展标准ViT骨干网络，添加可学习的质量token与图像块token拼接，通过全局自注意力聚合上下文信息，使用双头输出结构分别处理人脸表示和质量预测。

Result: 在多个具有挑战性的基准测试和多种人脸识别模型上，ViT-FIQA始终达到顶级性能，证明了Transformer架构在建模人脸图像效用方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 基于Transformer的架构在FIQA任务中表现出色，ViT有潜力作为未来FIQA研究的可扩展基础框架。

Abstract: Face Image Quality Assessment (FIQA) aims to predict the utility of a face
image for face recognition (FR) systems. State-of-the-art FIQA methods mainly
rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), leaving the potential of Vision
Transformer (ViT) architectures underexplored. This work proposes ViT-FIQA, a
novel approach that extends standard ViT backbones, originally optimized for
FR, through a learnable quality token designed to predict a scalar utility
score for any given face image. The learnable quality token is concatenated
with the standard image patch tokens, and the whole sequence is processed via
global self-attention by the ViT encoders to aggregate contextual information
across all patches. At the output of the backbone, ViT-FIQA branches into two
heads: (1) the patch tokens are passed through a fully connected layer to learn
discriminative face representations via a margin-penalty softmax loss, and (2)
the quality token is fed into a regression head to learn to predict the face
sample's utility. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks and several
FR models, including both CNN- and ViT-based architectures, demonstrate that
ViT-FIQA consistently achieves top-tier performance. These results underscore
the effectiveness of transformer-based architectures in modeling face image
utility and highlight the potential of ViTs as a scalable foundation for future
FIQA research https://cutt.ly/irHlzXUC.

Abstract: Depth estimation is a fundamental task for 3D scene understanding in
autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. Existing depth datasets,
such as KITTI, nuScenes, and DDAD, have advanced the field but suffer from
limitations in diversity and scalability. As benchmark performance on these
datasets approaches saturation, there is an increasing need for a new
generation of large-scale, diverse, and cost-efficient datasets to support the
era of foundation models and multi-modal learning. To address these challenges,
we introduce a large-scale, diverse, frame-wise continuous dataset for depth
estimation in dynamic outdoor driving environments, comprising 20K video frames
to evaluate existing methods. Our lightweight acquisition pipeline ensures
broad scene coverage at low cost, while sparse yet statistically sufficient
ground truth enables robust training. Compared to existing datasets, ours
presents greater diversity in driving scenarios and lower depth density,
creating new challenges for generalization. Benchmark experiments with standard
monocular depth estimation models validate the dataset's utility and highlight
substantial performance gaps in challenging conditions, establishing a new
platform for advancing depth estimation research.

Abstract: Video action detection requires dense spatio-temporal annotations, which are
both challenging and expensive to obtain. However, real-world videos often vary
in difficulty and may not require the same level of annotation. This paper
analyzes the appropriate annotation types for each sample and their impact on
spatio-temporal video action detection. It focuses on two key aspects: 1) how
to obtain varying levels of annotation for videos, and 2) how to learn action
detection from different annotation types. The study explores video-level tags,
points, scribbles, bounding boxes, and pixel-level masks. First, a simple
active learning strategy is proposed to estimate the necessary annotation type
for each video. Then, a novel spatio-temporal 3D-superpixel approach is
introduced to generate pseudo-labels from these annotations, enabling effective
training. The approach is validated on UCF101-24 and JHMDB-21 datasets,
significantly cutting annotation costs with minimal performance loss.

Abstract: The design and analysis of pallet setups are essential for ensuring safety of
packages transportation. With rising demands in the logistics sector, the
development of automated systems utilizing advanced technologies has become

physical simulation system capable of replicating the behavior of moving
pallets. It features a 3D graphics-based virtual environment that supports a
wide range of configurations, including variable package layouts, different
wrapping materials, and diverse dynamic conditions. This innovative approach
reduces the need for physical testing, cutting costs and environmental impact
while improving measurement accuracy for analyzing pallet dynamics.
Additionally, we train a deep neural network to evaluate the rendered videos

Abstract: Outside of urban hubs, autonomous cars and trucks have to master driving on
intercity highways. Safe, long-distance highway travel at speeds exceeding 100
km/h demands perception distances of at least 250 m, which is about five times
the 50-100m typically addressed in city driving, to allow sufficient planning
and braking margins. Increasing the perception ranges also allows to extend
autonomy from light two-ton passenger vehicles to large-scale forty-ton trucks,
which need a longer planning horizon due to their high inertia. However, most
existing perception approaches focus on shorter ranges and rely on Bird's Eye
View (BEV) representations, which incur quadratic increases in memory and
compute costs as distance grows. To overcome this limitation, we built on top
of a sparse representation and introduced an efficient 3D encoding of
multi-modal and temporal features, along with a novel self-supervised
pre-training scheme that enables large-scale learning from unlabeled
camera-LiDAR data. Our approach extends perception distances to 250 meters and
achieves an 26.6% improvement in mAP in object detection and a decrease of
30.5% in Chamfer Distance in LiDAR forecasting compared to existing methods,
reaching distances up to 250 meters. Project Page:

We introduce a token matching strategy that ensures accurate spatial
correspondence during refinement, enabling local detail synthesis while
preserving global structure. By carefully designing our training data to match
the characteristics of synthesized coarse shapes, our method can effectively

Conclusion: 该方法通过智能选择非关键帧来补充场景信息，显著提升了3D高斯涂射模型的完整性，为在线3D重建提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of generating online 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) models from RGB-only frames. Previous studies have employed dense SLAM
techniques to estimate 3D scenes from keyframes for 3DGS model construction.
However, these methods are limited by their reliance solely on keyframes, which
are insufficient to capture an entire scene, resulting in incomplete
reconstructions. Moreover, building a generalizable model requires
incorporating frames from diverse viewpoints to achieve broader scene coverage.
However, online processing restricts the use of many frames or extensive
training iterations. Therefore, we propose a novel method for high-quality 3DGS
modeling that improves model completeness through adaptive view selection. By
analyzing reconstruction quality online, our approach selects optimal
non-keyframes for additional training. By integrating both keyframes and
selected non-keyframes, the method refines incomplete regions from diverse
viewpoints, significantly enhancing completeness. We also present a framework
that incorporates an online multi-view stereo approach, ensuring consistency in
3D information throughout the 3DGS modeling process. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, delivering
exceptional performance in complex outdoor scenes.

Result: 在保持干净数据准确性的同时，达到了最先进的攻击性能，并对常见后门防御方法表现出鲁棒性

Conclusion: Noisy Alignment是一种简单而有效的数据投毒后门攻击方法，通过显式噪声对齐显著提升了攻击效果

Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning (CL) effectively learns transferable
representations from unlabeled data containing images or image-text pairs but
suffers vulnerability to data poisoning backdoor attacks (DPCLs). An adversary
can inject poisoned images into pretraining datasets, causing compromised CL
encoders to exhibit targeted misbehavior in downstream tasks. Existing DPCLs,
however, achieve limited efficacy due to their dependence on fragile implicit
co-occurrence between backdoor and target object and inadequate suppression of
discriminative features in backdoored images. We propose Noisy Alignment (NA),
a DPCL method that explicitly suppresses noise components in poisoned images.
Inspired by powerful training-controllable CL attacks, we identify and extract
the critical objective of noisy alignment, adapting it effectively into
data-poisoning scenarios. Our method implements noisy alignment by
strategically manipulating contrastive learning's random cropping mechanism,
formulating this process as an image layout optimization problem with
theoretically derived optimal parameters. The resulting method is simple yet
effective, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to existing DPCLs,
while maintaining clean-data accuracy. Furthermore, Noisy Alignment
demonstrates robustness against common backdoor defenses. Codes can be found at

Result: 在HDTF、CelebV-HQ和EMTD数据集上进行综合评估，证明该方法达到了最先进的性能。数据指标显示具有更优称的视觉真实感、情感一致性和全身动作同步性。

Conclusion: InfiniteTalk通过散布帧方法有效解决了传统视频录音技术的限制，实现了高质量的音频驱动全身动画生成，为长序列录音提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in video AIGC have ushered in a transformative era for
audio-driven human animation. However, conventional video dubbing techniques
remain constrained to mouth region editing, resulting in discordant facial
expressions and body gestures that compromise viewer immersion. To overcome
this limitation, we introduce sparse-frame video dubbing, a novel paradigm that
strategically preserves reference keyframes to maintain identity, iconic
gestures, and camera trajectories while enabling holistic, audio-synchronized
full-body motion editing. Through critical analysis, we identify why naive
image-to-video models fail in this task, particularly their inability to
achieve adaptive conditioning. Addressing this, we propose InfiniteTalk, a
streaming audio-driven generator designed for infinite-length long sequence
dubbing. This architecture leverages temporal context frames for seamless
inter-chunk transitions and incorporates a simple yet effective sampling
strategy that optimizes control strength via fine-grained reference frame
positioning. Comprehensive evaluations on HDTF, CelebV-HQ, and EMTD datasets
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Quantitative metrics confirm superior
visual realism, emotional coherence, and full-body motion synchronization.

TL;DR: 首个3D高斯拓扑矩阵的知识精缩框架，通过多老师模型指导轻量化学生模型，在保持渲染质量的同时大幅减少内存和存储需求


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯拓扑矩阵虽然在新视角合成方面表现优异，但需要大量高斯分布导致内存和存储成本迅增，需要解决这一问题

Method: 提出知识精缩框架，使用多种老师模型（原生3DGS、噪声增强版本、dropout正则化版本）输出指导轻量化学生模型，并提出结构相似性损失来保持学生与老师模型间的空间几何结构一致性

Result: 通过多数据集的完整定量和定性评估，Distilled-3DGS框架在渲染质量和存储效率方面都达到了与最先进方法相比的有景结果

Conclusion: 该框架是一种简单但有效的方法，无需复杂的设计，能够在保持高保真渲染的同时显著降低3D高斯拓扑矩阵的存储和计算需求

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has exhibited remarkable efficacy in novel view
synthesis (NVS). However, it suffers from a significant drawback: achieving
high-fidelity rendering typically necessitates a large number of 3D Gaussians,
resulting in substantial memory consumption and storage requirements. To
address this challenge, we propose the first knowledge distillation framework
for 3DGS, featuring various teacher models, including vanilla 3DGS,
noise-augmented variants, and dropout-regularized versions. The outputs of
these teachers are aggregated to guide the optimization of a lightweight
student model. To distill the hidden geometric structure, we propose a
structural similarity loss to boost the consistency of spatial geometric
distributions between the student and teacher model. Through comprehensive
quantitative and qualitative evaluations across diverse datasets, the proposed
Distilled-3DGS, a simple yet effective framework without bells and whistles,
achieves promising rendering results in both rendering quality and storage
efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods. Project page:

Motivation: 传统检索框架在处理细粒度组合查询和时间理解变化方面遇到困难，需要更好地对齐素蕴的查询修改和目标视频。

Method: 构建包含160万样本的Dense-WebVid-CoVR数据集，使用基于地面的文本编码器通过交叉注意力融合视觉和文本信息，实现精确对齐。

Result: 在视觉+文本设置下达到71.3% Recall@1，比现有最佳方法提高3.4%，在所有指标上都达到了state-of-the-art结果。

Conclusion: 该方法通过素蕴的视频描述和修改文本，在细粒度组合视频检索任务中表现出艶强的效果，为复杂查询的处理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Composed video retrieval is a challenging task that strives to retrieve a
target video based on a query video and a textual description detailing
specific modifications. Standard retrieval frameworks typically struggle to
handle the complexity of fine-grained compositional queries and variations in
temporal understanding limiting their retrieval ability in the fine-grained
setting. To address this issue, we introduce a novel dataset that captures both
fine-grained and composed actions across diverse video segments, enabling more
detailed compositional changes in retrieved video content. The proposed
dataset, named Dense-WebVid-CoVR, consists of 1.6 million samples with dense
modification text that is around seven times more than its existing
counterpart. We further develop a new model that integrates visual and textual
information through Cross-Attention (CA) fusion using grounded text encoder,
enabling precise alignment between dense query modifications and target videos.
The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results surpassing existing
methods on all metrics. Notably, it achieves 71.3\% Recall@1 in visual+text
setting and outperforms the state-of-the-art by 3.4\%, highlighting its
efficacy in terms of leveraging detailed video descriptions and dense
modification texts. Our proposed dataset, code, and model are available at

Splatting framework featuring: (1) Incremental Joint Optimization that
concurrently optimizes camera poses and 3D Gaussians to avoid local minima and
ensure global consistency; (2) a robust Pose Estimation Module leveraging
learned 3D priors; and (3) an efficient Octree Anchor Formation mechanism that
converts dense point clouds into anchors based on spatial density. Extensive

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个扩展的演员级流水线，用于检测和减少大规模文本语料库中的性别偏见，并在德国报纸语料库中验证了其效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型输出常带有来自训练数据的结构性性别不平衡问题，需要新方法来检测和减少这些偏见。

Method: 基于话语感知公平性分析，提出了新的演员级指标，包括情感不对称性、句法主动性和引用风格。支持诊断性语料分析和排除基于的平衡处理。

Result: 在taz2024full德国报纸语料库(1980-2024)中实验，在多个语言维度上显示出性别平衡的显著改善。表面层面的不对称性可通过过滤和重新平衡来减少，但情感和框架方面的更细微偏见仍持续存在。

Conclusion: 该流水线能够有效检测和减少文本语料中的性别偏见，并为话语基础的公平性审计和公平语料建设提供了工具支持。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly shaping digital communication, yet
their outputs often reflect structural gender imbalances that originate from
their training data. This paper presents an extended actor-level pipeline for
detecting and mitigating gender discrimination in large-scale text corpora.
Building on prior work in discourse-aware fairness analysis, we introduce new
actor-level metrics that capture asymmetries in sentiment, syntactic agency,
and quotation styles. The pipeline supports both diagnostic corpus analysis and
exclusion-based balancing, enabling the construction of fairer corpora. We
apply our approach to the taz2024full corpus of German newspaper articles from
1980 to 2024, demonstrating substantial improvements in gender balance across
multiple linguistic dimensions. Our results show that while surface-level
asymmetries can be mitigated through filtering and rebalancing, subtler forms
of bias persist, particularly in sentiment and framing. We release the tools
and reports to support further research in discourse-based fairness auditing
and equitable corpus construction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有网页浏览基准测试主要关注文本信息，忽略了网页中普遍存在的多模态内容，需要专门评估AI代理处理图像和视频等多模态信息的能力。

Method: 创建包含224个挑战性问题的基准测试，问题提示中常包含图像，网页搜索和推理过程中的关键信息也嵌入在图像或视频中，并提供验证清单进行细粒度分析。

Result: 对最先进模型的评估显示，即使是OpenAI o3等顶级模型也只能达到29.02%的准确率，表明当前模型的多模态能力不足且缺乏原生多模态推理能力。

Conclusion: 当前AI代理在多模态网页浏览方面存在显著不足，需要开发更好的多模态推理能力来处理网页中的图像和视频内容。

Abstract: AI agents with advanced reasoning and tool use capabilities have demonstrated
impressive performance in web browsing for deep search. While existing
benchmarks such as BrowseComp evaluate these browsing abilities, they primarily
focus on textual information, overlooking the prevalence of multimodal content.
To bridge this gap, we introduce MM-BrowseComp, a novel benchmark comprising
224 challenging, hand-crafted questions specifically designed to assess agents'
multimodal retrieval and reasoning capabilities. These questions often
incorporate images in prompts, and crucial information encountered during the
search and reasoning process may also be embedded within images or videos on
webpages. Consequently, methods relying solely on text prove insufficient for
our benchmark. Additionally, we provide a verified checklist for each question,
enabling fine-grained analysis of multimodal dependencies and reasoning paths.
Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models on MM-BrowseComp
reveals that even top models like OpenAI o3 with tools achieve only 29.02\%
accuracy, highlighting the suboptimal multimodal capabilities and lack of
native multimodal reasoning in current models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然基于RNN-T的ASR系统能够实时转写，但在设备上实现流媒体实时语音翻译仍面临重大挑战，需要找到翻译质量和延迟之间的有效平衡。

Method: 提出同步翻译方法，利用ASR系统生成的语言线索管理上下文，采用高效的检索剪枝技术（如超时和强制终止）来维持系统的实时因子。

Result: 在设备上的双语对话语音翻译中，该方法在延迟和质量方面都超过了基线方法，缩小了与非流媒体翻译系统的质量差距。

Conclusion: 该技术为更准确和高效的实时语音翻译平台推广奠定了基础，表明通过优化ASR和MT的集成可以在保持实时性的同时显著提升翻译质量。

Abstract: This paper tackles several challenges that arise when integrating Automatic
Speech Recognition (ASR) and Machine Translation (MT) for real-time, on-device
streaming speech translation. Although state-of-the-art ASR systems based on
Recurrent Neural Network Transducers (RNN-T) can perform real-time
transcription, achieving streaming translation in real-time remains a
significant challenge. To address this issue, we propose a simultaneous
translation approach that effectively balances translation quality and latency.
We also investigate efficient integration of ASR and MT, leveraging linguistic
cues generated by the ASR system to manage context and utilizing efficient
beam-search pruning techniques such as time-out and forced finalization to
maintain system's real-time factor. We apply our approach to an on-device
bilingual conversational speech translation and demonstrate that our techniques
outperform baselines in terms of latency and quality. Notably, our technique
narrows the quality gap with non-streaming translation systems, paving the way
for more accurate and efficient real-time speech translation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用推理模型提升LLM在逻辑任务中的表现，习语检测作为需要理解后再推理的语言任务可能受益于此

Method: 评估DeepSeek-R1蒸馏模型系列(1.5B-70B参数)在四个习语检测数据集上的表现，分析思维链推理和模型大小的影响

Result: 推理效果较小且多变：小模型CoT推理可从数学调优模型提升性能但不及基础模型，大模型(14B+)有适度改进；大模型能准确生成习语定义，小模型常失败；为小模型提供定义可改善性能

Conclusion: 模型大小对习语理解能力有显著影响，大模型展现良好的习语理解能力，而小模型需要外部定义支持来提升检测性能

Abstract: The recent trend towards utilisation of reasoning models has improved the
performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) across many tasks which involve
logical steps. One linguistic task that could benefit from this framing is
idiomaticity detection, as a potentially idiomatic expression must first be
understood before it can be disambiguated and serves as a basis for reasoning.
In this paper, we explore how reasoning capabilities in LLMs affect
idiomaticity detection performance and examine the effect of model size. We
evaluate, as open source representative models, the suite of DeepSeek-R1
distillation models ranging from 1.5B to 70B parameters across four
idiomaticity detection datasets. We find the effect of reasoning to be smaller
and more varied than expected. For smaller models, producing chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning increases performance from Math-tuned intermediate models, but
not to the levels of the base models, whereas larger models (14B, 32B, and 70B)
show modest improvements. Our in-depth analyses reveal that larger models
demonstrate good understanding of idiomaticity, successfully producing accurate
definitions of expressions, while smaller models often fail to output the
actual meaning. For this reason, we also experiment with providing definitions
in the prompts of smaller models, which we show can improve performance in some
cases.

Motivation: ASR系统在长音频转录中维持语法和语义准确性面临挑战，影响命名实体识别、大写化和标点符号等任务的性能

Method: 采用两种策略：(1)使用最优运输进行标记级精炼以对齐维度和序列长度；(2)最小化Whisper和LLaMA句子嵌入表示之间的表征损失，融合语法和语义

Result: 在Spoken Wikipedia数据集上评估显示，在词错误率(WER)、命名实体识别、大写化和标点符号成功率方面都取得了显著改善

Conclusion: 通过引入新的NER指标和探索语义感知ASR，该工作强调了将语言上下文集成到转录中的价值，为长形式语音的稳健、上下文感知ASR系统奠定了基础

Abstract: ASR systems often struggle with maintaining syntactic and semantic accuracy
in long audio transcripts, impacting tasks like Named Entity Recognition (NER),
capitalization, and punctuation. We propose a novel approach that enhances ASR
by distilling contextual knowledge from LLaMA models into Whisper. Our method
uses two strategies: (1) token level distillation with optimal transport to
align dimensions and sequence lengths, and (2) representation loss minimization
between sentence embeddings of Whisper and LLaMA, blending syntax and
semantics. Evaluations on the Spoken Wikipedia dataset, a benchmark with long
audios and rich entities demonstrate significant improvements in Word Error
Rate (WER), NER, capitalization, and punctuation success. By introducing novel
NER metrics and exploring semantics aware ASR, our work highlights the value of
integrating linguistic context into transcription, setting a foundation for
robust, context-aware ASR in longform speech.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统LLM在复杂问题解决中存在的格式崩溃、冗长循环和推理不连贯等问题，提供更高效、准确的分析能力。

Method: 使用轨迹中心合成数据生成器创建144,000个标记笔记本片段；双奖励框架结合标签结构信号和分层奖励模型；采用内存优化的GRPO实现；提供双推理接口（代理模式和反思模式）。

Result: 在AIME 2024/2025和LiveCodeBench等基准测试中准确率提升30%，token使用减少18-49%，达到甚至超越更大规模模型（如QwQ-32B）的性能水平。

Conclusion: Datarus通过创新的训练方法和架构设计，成功实现了更高效、更准确的问题解决能力，避免了传统RL对齐模型的常见问题，为复杂数据分析任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We present Datarus-R1-14B, a 14 B-parameter open-weights language model
fine-tuned from Qwen 2.5-14B-Instruct to act as a virtual data analyst and
graduate-level problem solver. Datarus is trained not on isolated
question-answer pairs but on full analytical trajectories including reasoning
steps, code execution, error traces, self-corrections, and final conclusions,
all captured in a ReAct-style notebook format spanning finance, medicine,
numerical analysis, and other quantitative domains. Our training pipeline
combines (i) a trajectory-centric synthetic data generator that yielded 144 000
tagged notebook episodes, (ii) a dual-reward framework blending a lightweight
tag-based structural signal with a Hierarchical Reward Model (HRM) that scores
both single-step soundness and end-to-end coherence, and (iii) a
memory-optimized implementation of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
featuring KV-cache reuse, sequential generation, and reference-model sharding.
A cosine curriculum smoothly shifts emphasis from structural fidelity to
semantic depth, reducing the format collapse and verbosity that often plague
RL-aligned LLMs. A central design choice in Datarus is it dual reasoning
interface. In agentic mode the model produces ReAct-tagged steps that invoke
Python tools to execute real code; in reflection mode it outputs compact
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces delimited by <think> and <answer> tags. On
demanding postgraduate-level problems, Datarus exhibits an "AHA-moment"
pattern: it sketches hypotheses, revises them once or twice, and converges
avoiding the circular, token-inflating loops common to contemporary systems.
Across standard public benchmarks Datarus surpasses similar size models and
even reaches the level of larger reasoning models such as QwQ-32B achieving up
to 30% higher accuracy on AIME 2024/2025 and LiveCodeBench while emitting
18-49% fewer tokens per solution.

Result: SFT在英语中提升P@5 16-20%，普通话中63-165%，提高具体性度，达到人类水平的情绪价值。价值观问卷中答案分布向目标文化偏移

Conclusion: 少量文化基础数据能够以低成本方式实现价值对齐，7-8B模型可以比较原生70B模型，强调基于人类认知的文化对齐研究的重要性

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly mediate cross-cultural
communication, their behavior still reflects the distributional bias of the
languages and viewpoints that are over-represented in their pre-training
corpora. Yet, it remains a challenge to model and align culture due to limited
cultural knowledge and a lack of exploration into effective learning
approaches. We introduce a cost-efficient, cognitively grounded remedy:
parameter-efficient fine-tuning on native speakers' free word-association
norms, which encode implicit cultural schemas. Leveraging English-US and
Mandarin associations from the Small-World-of-Words project, we adapt
Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and PPO-based
preference optimization. SFT boosts held-out association Precision at 5 by
16-20% in English and 43-165% in Mandarin, lifts median concreteness by +0.20,
and attains human-level valence and arousal. These lexical gains transfer: on
World-Values-Survey questions, fine-tuned models shift answer distributions
toward the target culture, and on a 50-item high-tension subset, Qwen's
Chinese-aligned responses double while Llama's US bias drops by one-third. Our
7-8B models rival or beat vanilla 70B baselines, showing that a few million
culture-grounded associations can instill value alignment without costly
retraining. Our work highlights both the promise and the need for future
research grounded in human cognition in improving cultural alignment in AI
models.

Motivation: 现有医疗大语言模型主要采用被动回答模式，缺乏主动信息收集能力，在真实临床交互场景中存在误诊风险

Method: 提出两阶段训练框架：1)SIG引导的模型初始化使用蒙特卡洛树搜索构建高质量交互轨迹；2)SIG增强的策略优化结合新颖的SIG引导奖励分布机制

Result: 在两个新构建的部分信息医疗基准测试中，ProMed平均优于最先进方法6.29%，相比被动范式提升54.45%，且在域外案例中表现鲁棒

Conclusion: ProMed成功实现了医疗LLM从被动到主动交互范式的转变，通过SIG奖励机制有效提升了临床信息收集和诊断决策能力

Abstract: Interactive medical questioning is essential in real-world clinical
consultations, where physicians must actively gather information from patients.
While medical Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities
in static medical question answering, they predominantly operate under a
reactive paradigm: generating answers directly without seeking additional
information, which risks incorrect diagnoses in such interactive settings. To
address this limitation, we propose ProMed, a reinforcement learning (RL)
framework that transitions medical LLMs toward a proactive paradigm, equipping
them with the ability to ask clinically valuable questions before
decision-making. At the core of ProMed is the Shapley Information Gain (SIG)
reward, which quantifies the clinical utility of each question by combining the
amount of newly acquired information with its contextual importance, estimated
via Shapley values. We integrate SIG into a two-stage training pipeline: (1)
SIG-Guided Model Initialization uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to
construct high-reward interaction trajectories to supervise the model, and (2)
SIG-Augmented Policy Optimization, which integrates SIG and enhances RL with a
novel SIG-guided Reward Distribution Mechanism that assigns higher rewards to
informative questions for targeted optimization. Extensive experiments on two
newly curated partial-information medical benchmarks demonstrate that ProMed
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by an average of 6.29% and
delivers a 54.45% gain over the reactive paradigm, while also generalizing
robustly to out-of-domain cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有阿拉伯语言模型主要支持现代标准阿拉伯语(MSA)，对沙特方言如纳吉迪和氪贾兹支持有限，影响了对真实方言变体的抓取能力

Method: 使用私有沙特方言指令数据集(5,466条合成指令-响应对)，通过LoRA微调ALLaM-7B-Instruct-preview模型，测试两种方案：方言标签训练和无标签训练

Result: 方言标签模型表现最佳，将沙特方言生成率从47.97%提升到84.21%，MSA泄漏率从32.63%降至6.21%，文本保真度也有显著提升

Conclusion: LoRA微调技术能够有效提升阿拉伯语模型对沙特方言的支持能力，方言标签方案在方言控制和文本质量方面都超过其他通用指令模型

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) for Arabic are still dominated by Modern
Standard Arabic (MSA), with limited support for Saudi dialects such as Najdi
and Hijazi. This underrepresentation hinders their ability to capture authentic
dialectal variation. Using a privately curated Saudi Dialect Instruction
dataset (Hijazi and Najdi; 5,466 synthetic instruction-response pairs; 50/50
split), we LoRA-tune ALLaM-7B-Instruct-preview, the first foundation model
developed in Saudi Arabia, for Saudi dialect generation. We investigate two
variants: (i) Dialect-Token training, which prepends an explicit dialect tag to
the instruction, and (ii) No-Token training, which omits the tag at formatting
time. Evaluation on a held-out test set combines an external dialect classifier
with text fidelity metrics (chrF++ and BERTScore) and diversity measures. The
Dialect-Token model achieves the best control, raising the Saudi rate from
47.97% to 84.21% and reducing MSA leakage from 32.63% to 6.21%; fidelity also
improves (chrF++ +3.53, BERTScore +0.059). Both LoRA variants outperform strong
generic instruction models (Falcon-7B-Instruct, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct,
Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct, AceGPT-v2-8B-Chat, JAIS-13B-Chat) in dialect control and
fidelity, while avoiding metadata-tag echoing that these baselines frequently
exhibit. We do not release the dataset or any model weights/adapters; instead,
we release training/evaluation/inference code and a detailed datasheet (schema
and aggregate statistics) to support independent verification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型在低资源语言泰卢固语中的表现，理解模型局限性并为开发更具语言能力的模型提供信息。

Method: 创建包含729个多项选择和开放式问题的数据集，评估11个开源和闭源LLM，分析模型性能并进行细粒度分析。

Result: 发现LLMs依赖表面启发式方法（如答案位置和干扰项模式）处理多项选择题，比较了LLM-as-a-judge与人工评估在开放式问题中的可靠性。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce MATA, a novel evaluation dataset to assess the
ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Telugu language, comprising 729
carefully curated multiple-choice and open-ended questions that span diverse
linguistic dimensions. We evaluate 11 open-weight and closed-source LLMs on our
dataset and present a fine-grained analysis of their performance. Further, we
empirically show how LLMs rely on superficial heuristics such as answer
position and distractor patterns for multiple-choice questions. Finally, we
also compare LLM-as-a-judge evaluation with human evaluation for open-ended
questions and draw some conclusions on its reliability in a low-resource
language. We argue that such fine-grained evaluation is essential for
understanding model limitations and can inform the development of more
linguistically capable LLMs, while also serving as a foundation for future
research in Telugu NLP.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 模型压缩后虽然精度相近，但在可解释性和检验准确性方面与原始模型存在显著差异，不能直接作为可信赖的替代品


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究主要关注模型压缩后的精度性能，但性能平等并不保证可信赖性平等，需要构建一个两维度的信任平等性评估框架

Method: 提出两维度评估框架：1)可解释性对齐（使用LIME和SHAP测试）测量模型是否基于相同特征做决策；2)检验准确性相似性（通过ECE、MCE、Brier分数和可靠性图评估）测量模型预测概率的可靠性

Result: 实验结果显示，压缩模型与原始BERT-base模型在可解释性对齐和检验准确性方面存在显著差异，即使在精度几乎相同的情况下也如此

Conclusion: 压缩模型并不与大模型信任平等，在部署压缩模型作为替代品时，需要进行豪于性能平等的谨慎评估

Abstract: Large Deep Learning models are often compressed before being deployed in a
resource-constrained environment. Can we trust the prediction of compressed
models just as we trust the prediction of the original large model? Existing
work has keenly studied the effect of compression on accuracy and related
performance measures. However, performance parity does not guarantee
trust-equivalence. We propose a two-dimensional framework for trust-equivalence
evaluation. First, interpretability alignment measures whether the models base
their predictions on the same input features. We use LIME and SHAP tests to
measure the interpretability alignment. Second, calibration similarity measures
whether the models exhibit comparable reliability in their predicted
probabilities. It is assessed via ECE, MCE, Brier Score, and reliability
diagrams. We conducted experiments using BERT-base as the large model and its
multiple compressed variants. We focused on two text classification tasks:
natural language inference and paraphrase identification. Our results reveal
low interpretability alignment and significant mismatch in calibration
similarity. It happens even when the accuracies are nearly identical between
models. These findings show that compressed models are not trust-equivalent to
their large counterparts. Deploying compressed models as a drop-in replacement
for large models requires careful assessment, going beyond performance parity.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 在医疗应用中，确定性解码策略（如beam search）通常优于随机策略，模型大小影响性能但解码选择同样重要，医疗专用LLM并未显示整体优势


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗领域对文本生成准确性要求极高，但解码策略对LLM输出质量的影响尚未充分研究，特别是在医疗任务中

Method: 在5个开放式医疗任务（翻译、摘要、问答、对话、图像描述）中评估11种解码策略，使用不同大小的医疗专用和通用LLM

Result: beam search表现最佳，随机策略较差；大模型性能更好但推理时间更长；医疗LLM仅在2个任务中优于通用模型，且对解码策略更敏感；不同评估指标相关性因任务而异

Conclusion: 解码策略选择在医疗应用中至关重要，其影响有时甚至超过模型选择，需要谨慎选择解码方法

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on various decoding strategies to generate
text, and these choices can significantly affect output quality. In healthcare,
where accuracy is critical, the impact of decoding strategies remains
underexplored. We investigate this effect in five open-ended medical tasks,
including translation, summarization, question answering, dialogue, and image
captioning, evaluating 11 decoding strategies with medically specialized and
general-purpose LLMs of different sizes. Our results show that deterministic
strategies generally outperform stochastic ones: beam search achieves the
highest scores, while {\eta} and top-k sampling perform worst. Slower decoding
methods tend to yield better quality. Larger models achieve higher scores
overall but have longer inference times and are no more robust to decoding.
Surprisingly, while medical LLMs outperform general ones in two of the five
tasks, statistical analysis shows no overall performance advantage and reveals
greater sensitivity to decoding choice. We further compare multiple evaluation
metrics and find that correlations vary by task, with MAUVE showing weak
agreement with BERTScore and ROUGE, as well as greater sensitivity to the
decoding strategy. These results highlight the need for careful selection of
decoding methods in medical applications, as their influence can sometimes
exceed that of model choice.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语音LLM模型是否像文本LLM一样存在性别偏见，通过说话者分配来分析偏见

Method: 构建两个数据集：职业数据集（包含性别定型职业）和性别色彩词汇，分析Bark TTS模型的默认说话者分配

Result: Bark模型没有显示出系统性偏见，但显示出性别意识和某些性别倾向性

Conclusion: 语音LLM模型在性别表现上与文本LLM有所不同，说话者选择可作为偏见分析的有效工具

Abstract: Similar to text-based Large Language Models (LLMs), Speech-LLMs exhibit
emergent abilities and context awareness. However, whether these similarities
extend to gender bias remains an open question. This study proposes a
methodology leveraging speaker assignment as an analytic tool for bias
investigation. Unlike text-based models, which encode gendered associations
implicitly, Speech-LLMs must produce a gendered voice, making speaker selection
an explicit bias cue. We evaluate Bark, a Text-to-Speech (TTS) model, analyzing
its default speaker assignments for textual prompts. If Bark's speaker
selection systematically aligns with gendered associations, it may reveal
patterns in its training data or model design. To test this, we construct two
datasets: (i) Professions, containing gender-stereotyped occupations, and (ii)
Gender-Colored Words, featuring gendered connotations. While Bark does not
exhibit systematic bias, it demonstrates gender awareness and has some gender
inclinations.

Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (Document VQA) faces significant
challenges when processing long documents in low-resource environments due to
context limitations and insufficient training data. This paper presents
AdaDocVQA, a unified adaptive framework addressing these challenges through
three core innovations: a hybrid text retrieval architecture for effective
document segmentation, an intelligent data augmentation pipeline that
automatically generates high-quality reasoning question-answer pairs with
multi-level verification, and adaptive ensemble inference with dynamic
configuration generation and early stopping mechanisms. Experiments on Japanese
document VQA benchmarks demonstrate substantial improvements with 83.04\%
accuracy on Yes/No questions, 52.66\% on factual questions, and 44.12\% on
numerical questions in JDocQA, and 59\% accuracy on LAVA dataset. Ablation
studies confirm meaningful contributions from each component, and our framework
establishes new state-of-the-art results for Japanese document VQA while
providing a scalable foundation for other low-resource languages and
specialized domains. Our code available at:

TL;DR: CRISP是一种基于稀疏自编码器的参数高效方法，用于实现持久性概念遗忘，通过在多个层次识别并抑制关键特征来移除有害知识，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在现实应用中的部署增加，需要选择性移除有害知识同时保持模型效用的方法。现有稀疏自编码器方法主要在推理时操作，无法实现参数层面的持久改变，容易被恶意攻击者绕过。

Method: CRISP使用稀疏自编码器自动识别多个层次的关键特征，并抑制这些特征的激活，实现参数高效的持久性概念遗忘。

Result: 在两个大语言模型上的实验表明，CRISP在WMDP基准测试的安全关键遗忘任务上优于先前方法，成功移除有害知识的同时保持通用和领域内能力。特征级分析显示该方法能实现目标和良性概念的语义分离。

Conclusion: CRISP提供了一种有效的参数级持久概念遗忘方法，通过特征级干预实现精确的有害知识抑制，为模型安全部署提供了重要技术手段。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, the need to selectively remove unwanted knowledge while
preserving model utility has become paramount. Recent work has explored sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to perform precise interventions on monosemantic features.
However, most SAE-based methods operate at inference time, which does not
create persistent changes in the model's parameters. Such interventions can be
bypassed or reversed by malicious actors with parameter access. We introduce
CRISP, a parameter-efficient method for persistent concept unlearning using
SAEs. CRISP automatically identifies salient SAE features across multiple
layers and suppresses their activations. We experiment with two LLMs and show
that our method outperforms prior approaches on safety-critical unlearning
tasks from the WMDP benchmark, successfully removing harmful knowledge while
preserving general and in-domain capabilities. Feature-level analysis reveals
that CRISP achieves semantically coherent separation between target and benign
concepts, allowing precise suppression of the target features.

*Vy Tuong Dang,An Vo,Quang Tau,Duc Dm,Daeyoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了ViExam基准测试，首次全面评估了视觉语言模型在越南语多模态教育考试上的表现，发现当前最先进的VLM仅达到57.74%的准确率，远低于人类平均水平66.54%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然视觉语言模型在英语多模态任务上表现出色，但其在低资源语言（如越南语）的多模态教育内容上的性能尚未得到充分探索，需要评估这些主要基于英语数据训练的模型是否能处理真实的跨语言多模态推理任务。

Method: 构建了ViExam基准测试，包含2,548个多模态问题，涵盖7个学术领域（数学、物理、化学、生物、地理、驾驶测试和智商测试），测试了最先进和开源VLM的性能，并尝试了跨语言提示和人类协作方法。

Result: 最先进VLM平均准确率为57.74%，开源模型为27.70%，均低于人类平均水平66.54%。只有o3思维模型（74.07%）超过人类平均水平，但仍远低于人类最佳表现99.60%。跨语言提示反而使性能下降1个百分点，人类协作可提升5个百分点。

Conclusion: 当前VLM在越南语多模态教育评估中的表现仍有很大提升空间，跨语言迁移能力有限，需要开发更好的多语言多模态模型来支持低资源语言的教育应用。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities on English
multimodal tasks, but their performance on low-resource languages with
genuinely multimodal educational content remains largely unexplored. In this
work, we test how VLMs perform on Vietnamese educational assessments,
investigating whether VLMs trained predominantly on English data can handle
real-world cross-lingual multimodal reasoning. Our work presents the first
comprehensive evaluation of VLM capabilities on multimodal Vietnamese exams
through proposing ViExam, a benchmark containing 2,548 multimodal questions. We
find that state-of-the-art VLMs achieve only 57.74% while open-source models
achieve 27.70% mean accuracy across 7 academic domains, including Mathematics,
Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Geography, Driving Test, and IQ Test. Most VLMs
underperform average human test-takers (66.54%), with only the thinking VLM o3
(74.07%) exceeding human average performance, yet still falling substantially
short of human best performance (99.60%). Cross-lingual prompting with English
instructions while maintaining Vietnamese content fails to improve performance,
decreasing accuracy by 1 percentage point for SOTA VLMs. Human-in-the-loop
collaboration can partially improve VLM performance by 5 percentage points.

TL;DR: 这篇论文评估了28个大型语言模型在20种可反推理模式上的表现，发现强大模型在默认推理方面有潜力但存在显著缺陷，尤其是CoT提示导致性能下降，且模型常将通用语反漏解为全称判断


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用语言比如'鸟会飞'在语言学、哲学、逻辑学和认知科学中具有重要意义，它们允许异常情况且是默认推理的核心。研究者想了解当前LLM在这些复杂推理模式上的能力

Method: 使用28个大型语言模型进行测试，测试内容包括20种可反推理模式，比较了零次提示、少次提示和思维链提示(CoT)不同提示方式的效果

Result: 前沿模型在默认推理问题上表现良好，但模型间性能差异显著。少次提示对某些模型有稍微改善，但CoT提示导致了严重的性能下降（平均准确率下降11.14%）。大多数模型无法区分可反推理和弗执推理，或将通用语误解为全称判断

Conclusion: 当前的大型语言模型在默认推理方面既有前景也有限制，尤其在处理通用语言的异常性质和推理类型区分上面面临挑战

Abstract: This paper evaluates the capabilities of 28 large language models (LLMs) to
reason with 20 defeasible reasoning patterns involving generic generalizations
(e.g., 'Birds fly', 'Ravens are black') central to non-monotonic logic.
Generics are of special interest to linguists, philosophers, logicians, and
cognitive scientists because of their complex exception-permitting behaviour
and their centrality to default reasoning, cognition, and concept acquisition.
We find that while several frontier models handle many default reasoning
problems well, performance varies widely across models and prompting styles.
Few-shot prompting modestly improves performance for some models, but
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting often leads to serious performance degradation
(mean accuracy drop -11.14%, SD 15.74% in models performing above 75% accuracy
in zero-shot condition, temperature 0). Most models either struggle to
distinguish between defeasible and deductive inference or misinterpret generics
as universal statements. These findings underscore both the promise and limits
of current LLMs for default reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文挑战了通过预测准确性来评估词嵌入中语义知识编码的传统假设，证明即使随机信息也能被成功预测，表明这种方法主要反映向量空间的几何相似性而非真正的语义表征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解深度学习模型中隐含编码的知识对于提高AI系统可解释性至关重要。现有方法通过将词嵌入映射到人类可解释的语义特征来评估知识编码，但仅凭预测准确性无法可靠判断是否真正包含相应知识。

Method: 通过实验证明现有方法即使对随机信息也能成功预测，分析预测性能主要受算法上限而非语义表征决定，比较不同数据集上的预测表现。

Result: 发现预测准确性不能可靠指示词嵌入中真正的基于特征的可解释性，这些映射主要反映向量空间的几何相似性，而非语义属性的真正涌现。

Conclusion: 仅基于预测性能的数据集比较不可靠，需要开发更可靠的方法来评估词嵌入中语义知识的真实编码情况。

Abstract: Understanding what knowledge is implicitly encoded in deep learning models is
essential for improving the interpretability of AI systems. This paper examines
common methods to explain the knowledge encoded in word embeddings, which are
core elements of large language models (LLMs). These methods typically involve
mapping embeddings onto collections of human-interpretable semantic features,
known as feature norms. Prior work assumes that accurately predicting these
semantic features from the word embeddings implies that the embeddings contain
the corresponding knowledge. We challenge this assumption by demonstrating that
prediction accuracy alone does not reliably indicate genuine feature-based
interpretability.
  We show that these methods can successfully predict even random information,
concluding that the results are predominantly determined by an algorithmic
upper bound rather than meaningful semantic representation in the word
embeddings. Consequently, comparisons between datasets based solely on
prediction performance do not reliably indicate which dataset is better
captured by the word embeddings. Our analysis illustrates that such mappings
primarily reflect geometric similarity within vector spaces rather than
indicating the genuine emergence of semantic properties.

Motivation: 随着EEG在神经科学和临床实践中的广泛应用，如何高效检索和语义解释大规模、多源、异构的EEG数据成为一个紧迫挑战。

Method: 提出三层超图框架，将EEG领域知识、个体病例和大规模存储库统一为可遍历的n元关系超图，实现联合语义-时间检索和因果链诊断生成。

Conclusion: 该框架为EEG数据的智能分析和临床诊断提供了有效解决方案，同时建立了首个跨疾病、跨角色的EEG临床QA基准测试集。

Abstract: With the widespread application of electroencephalography (EEG) in
neuroscience and clinical practice, efficiently retrieving and semantically
interpreting large-scale, multi-source, heterogeneous EEG data has become a
pressing challenge. We propose EEG-MedRAG, a three-layer hypergraph-based
retrieval-augmented generation framework that unifies EEG domain knowledge,
individual patient cases, and a large-scale repository into a traversable n-ary
relational hypergraph, enabling joint semantic-temporal retrieval and
causal-chain diagnostic generation. Concurrently, we introduce the first
cross-disease, cross-role EEG clinical QA benchmark, spanning seven disorders
and five authentic clinical perspectives. This benchmark allows systematic
evaluation of disease-agnostic generalization and role-aware contextual
understanding. Experiments show that EEG-MedRAG significantly outperforms
TimeRAG and HyperGraphRAG in answer accuracy and retrieval, highlighting its
strong potential for real-world clinical decision support. Our data and code

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究大语言模型的奏顾性问题，提出了统一评估框架和Pressure-Tune方法来减少模型在科学问答中的奏顾行为


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在需要事实严谨的领域中常常显示奏顾性（无论正确与否都会结合用户信念），这在高风险科学问答场景中带来严重风险

Method: 提出统一评估框架来量化奏顾上下文对模型行为的影响，包括对抗性提示设置和目标指标；还提出了Pressure-Tune方法，通过在合成对抗对话和思维链理由上进行轻量细调

Result: 系统性评估显示开源和专有模型都存在普遍的奏顾倾向，主要由对齐策略驱动而非模型大小；Pressure-Tune在具有挑战性的科学问答测试中显著提高了奏顾抵抗力，而不影响准确性或对有效反馈的响应能力

Conclusion: 奏顾性是大语言模型在事实问答中的重要问题，Pressure-Tune方法为实现更真实和有原则的模型行为提供了实用途径

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), while increasingly used in domains requiring
factual rigor, often display a troubling behavior: sycophancy, the tendency to
align with user beliefs regardless of correctness. This tendency is reinforced
by preference-based alignment techniques that optimize for user satisfaction
but can undermine truthfulness. While relatively benign in casual dialogue,
sycophancy poses serious risks in high-stakes settings such as scientific
question answering (QA), where model outputs may shape collaborative reasoning,
decision-making, and knowledge formation. Despite its importance, this
phenomenon remains underexamined in factual QA contexts. We address this gap by
introducing a unified evaluation framework to quantify the impact of
sycophantic context on model behavior in scientific QA, measuring how much
user-imposed social pressure distorts model outputs. The framework incorporates
adversarial prompting setups and targeted metrics, such as misleading
resistance and sycophancy resistance, that capture a model's ability to
maintain factual consistency under misleading cues. Systematic evaluations
across open-source and proprietary models reveal pervasive sycophantic
tendencies, driven more by alignment strategy than by model size. To mitigate
this issue, we propose Pressure-Tune, a lightweight post-training method that
fine-tunes models on synthetic adversarial dialogues paired with
chain-of-thought rationales. These rationales reject user misinformation while
reinforcing factual commitments. Experiments on challenging scientific QA
benchmarks show that Pressure-Tune significantly enhances sycophancy resistance
without compromising accuracy or responsiveness to valid feedback, offering a
practical pathway toward more truthful and principled model behavior.

TL;DR: MGT-Prism是一种从频域角度检测机器生成文本的方法，通过低频域过滤和动态频谱对齐来提高跨域泛化能力，在11个测试数据集上平均准确率提升0.90%，F1分数提升0.92%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器生成文本检测器在同域训练测试时表现良好，但在跨域场景下由于域偏移问题泛化能力差，需要开发更好的跨域泛化检测方法。

Method: 通过频域分析发现机器生成文本与人类撰写文本在频谱模式上存在显著差异，设计了低频域过滤模块来过滤对域偏移敏感的文档级特征，以及动态频谱对齐策略来提取任务特定和域不变特征。

Result: 在三个域泛化场景的11个测试数据集上，MGT-Prism比最先进的基线方法平均准确率提升0.90%，F1分数提升0.92%。

Conclusion: 频域分析为机器生成文本检测提供了新的视角，MGT-Prism方法通过有效的频域特征处理显著提升了跨域泛化性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models have shown growing ability to generate fluent and
coherent texts that are highly similar to the writing style of humans. Current
detectors for Machine-Generated Text (MGT) perform well when they are trained
and tested in the same domain but generalize poorly to unseen domains, due to
domain shift between data from different sources. In this work, we propose
MGT-Prism, an MGT detection method from the perspective of the frequency domain
for better domain generalization. Our key insight stems from analyzing text
representations in the frequency domain, where we observe consistent spectral
patterns across diverse domains, while significant discrepancies in magnitude
emerge between MGT and human-written texts (HWTs). The observation initiates
the design of a low frequency domain filtering module for filtering out the
document-level features that are sensitive to domain shift, and a dynamic
spectrum alignment strategy to extract the task-specific and domain-invariant
features for improving the detector's performance in domain generalization.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGT-Prism outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines by an average of 0.90% in accuracy and 0.92% in F1 score on 11 test
datasets across three domain-generalization scenarios.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了大型语言模型生成文本与儿童语言的相似性，发现LLM生成的文本更长但词汇丰富度较低，更依赖高频词，名词使用不足，语义相似性较低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在教育中的应用增加，需要了解LLM生成的文本是否能够真实模拟儿童语言特征，这对教育工具的开发具有重要意义。

Method: 使用德国儿童图片故事描述语料库，通过零样本和少样本提示生成LLM文本，比较心理语言学文本属性（词频、词汇丰富度、句子长度、词性标注、语义相似性等）。

Result: LLM生成的文本比儿童文本更长但词汇丰富度更低，更多使用高频词，名词代表性不足，语义向量空间分析显示相似性较低。少样本提示仅略微提高了相似性。

Conclusion: LLM难以准确复制儿童语言模式，这对LLM在心理语言学研究和儿童教育工具中的应用提出了重要问题，需要谨慎考虑其适用性。

Abstract: The role of large language models (LLMs) in education is increasing, yet
little attention has been paid to whether LLM-generated text resembles child
language. This study evaluates how LLMs replicate child-like language by
comparing LLM-generated texts to a collection of German children's descriptions
of picture stories. We generated two LLM-based corpora using the same picture
stories and two prompt types: zero-shot and few-shot prompts specifying a
general age from the children corpus. We conducted a comparative analysis
across psycholinguistic text properties, including word frequency, lexical
richness, sentence and word length, part-of-speech tags, and semantic
similarity with word embeddings. The results show that LLM-generated texts are
longer but less lexically rich, rely more on high-frequency words, and
under-represent nouns. Semantic vector space analysis revealed low similarity,
highlighting differences between the two corpora on the level of corpus
semantics. Few-shot prompt increased similarities between children and LLM text
to a minor extent, but still failed to replicate lexical and semantic patterns.
The findings contribute to our understanding of how LLMs approximate child
language through multimodal prompting (text + image) and give insights into
their use in psycholinguistic research and education while raising important
questions about the appropriateness of LLM-generated language in child-directed
educational tools.

Abstract: While document summarization with LLMs has enhanced access to textual
information, concerns about the factual accuracy of these summaries persist,
especially in the medical domain. Tracing evidence from which summaries are
derived enables users to assess their accuracy, thereby alleviating this
concern. In this paper, we introduce TracSum, a novel benchmark for traceable,
aspect-based summarization, in which generated summaries are paired with
sentence-level citations, enabling users to trace back to the original context.
First, we annotate 500 medical abstracts for seven key medical aspects,
yielding 3.5K summary-citation pairs. We then propose a fine-grained evaluation
framework for this new task, designed to assess the completeness and
consistency of generated content using four metrics. Finally, we introduce a
summarization pipeline, Track-Then-Sum, which serves as a baseline method for
comparison. In experiments, we evaluate both this baseline and a set of LLMs on
TracSum, and conduct a human evaluation to assess the evaluation results. The
findings demonstrate that TracSum can serve as an effective benchmark for
traceable, aspect-based summarization tasks. We also observe that explicitly
performing sentence-level tracking prior to summarization enhances generation
accuracy, while incorporating the full context further improves completeness.

### [107] [Beyond Human Judgment: A Bayesian Evaluation of LLMs' Moral Values Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13804)
*Maciej Skorski,Alina Landowska*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这项研究通过贝叶斯方法评估大语言模型的道德理解能力，发现AI模型在道德判断上能达到前25%人类注释者的水平，且错死率更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 之前的研究多使用确定性真实标签，无法抓取人类注释的不确定性。本研究想要更全面地评估大语言模型在道德维度上与人类的对比。

Method: 使用贝叶斯模型来抓取注释者分歧（随机不确定性）和模型领域敏感性（认知不确定性）。评估了Claude Sonnet 4、DeepSeek-V3、Llama 4 Maverick等顶级模型，涉及25万+注释、700名注释者、10万+文本。通过GPU优化框架进行了100万+模型查询。

Result: AI模型通常能进入前25%人类注释者行列，平衡准确率远超人类平均水平。重要发现是AI产生的假阶性错误比人类要少得多，显示出更敏感的道德检测能力。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在道德理解方面表现出艰，能够达到人类中群体的前25%水平，并且在错死率控制方面更优。这为AI模型在道德判断任务中的应用提供了重要支撑。

Abstract: How do large language models understand moral dimensions compared to humans?
  This first large-scale Bayesian evaluation of market-leading language models
provides the answer. In contrast to prior work using deterministic ground truth
(majority or inclusion rules), we model annotator disagreements to capture both
aleatoric uncertainty (inherent human disagreement) and epistemic uncertainty
(model domain sensitivity). We evaluate top language models (Claude Sonnet 4,
DeepSeek-V3, Llama 4 Maverick) across 250K+ annotations from ~700 annotators on
100K+ texts spanning social media, news, and forums.
  Our GPU-optimized Bayesian framework processed 1M+ model queries, revealing
that AI models typically rank among the top 25\% of human annotators, achieving
much better-than-average balanced accuracy. Importantly, we find that AI
produces far fewer false negatives than humans, highlighting their more
sensitive moral detection capabilities.

### [108] [Prompt-Based One-Shot Exact Length-Controlled Generation with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13805)
*Juncheng Xie,Hung-yi Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过插入计数器标记和明确计数规则的提示策略，使得大语言模型能够准确控制生成文本的长度，无需微调或迭代采样


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在生成文本时经常无法准确遵循显式的长度指令，导致生成文本过长或过短，因为模型无法可靠地进行内部词元计数

Method: 提出一种基于提示的一次学习策略，在提示中添加计数器标记和明确的计数规则，使得模型在写作过程中同时进行计数，从而生成准确数量的词歇（英语）或字符（中文）

Result: 在MT-Bench-LI任务中，GPT-4.1的严格长度遵循率从累累提示下的30%以下提升到95%以上，超越了流行的草稿-然后修计基准方法，同时保持了评估的答案质量

Conclusion: 精确的长度控制可以仅通过提示工程实现，提供了一种轻量级的替代方案，无需训练或基于解码的方法

Abstract: Controlling the length of text produced by large language models (LLMs)
remains challenging: models frequently overshoot or undershoot explicit length
instructions because they cannot reliably keep an internal token count. We
present a prompt-based, one-shot strategy that compels an off-the-shelf LLM to
generate exactly a desired number of tokens - words (English) or characters
(Chinese) - without any fine-tuning or iterative sampling. The prompt appends
countdown markers and explicit counting rules so that the model "writes while
counting." We evaluate on four settings: open-ended generation (1-1000 tokens),
XSUM summarization, MT-Bench-LI instruction following, and the LIFEBENCH
equal-length track. On MT-Bench-LI, strict length compliance with GPT-4.1 leaps
from below 30% under naive prompts to above 95% with our countdown prompt,
surpassing the popular draft-then-revise baseline, while judged answer quality
is preserved. These results show that precise length control can be achieved
through prompt engineering alone, offering a lightweight alternative to
training- or decoding-based methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 自动评估指标形式从词法比较到语义相似性模型，再到LLM评估器，但无单一指标能完美反映人类判断，需根据具体任务选择并采用互补评估方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言生成评估对AI应用至关重要，人工评估成本高且难扩展，需要可扩展的自动评估指标。虽然开发了多种自动评估方法，但无单一指标能完美代替人类判断，并存在使用不一致问题。

Method: 对现有自动评估指标进行系统性检查，包括方法论、文档化优缺点、验证方法以及与人类判断的相关性分析。特别重点研究了LLM-as-a-Judge方法和RAG任务的评估。

Result: 发现自动评估指标存在多项关键挑战：只能抓取文本质量的特定方面、效果随任务和数据集而异、验证实践结构化不足、与人类判断相关性不稳定。这些问题在最新的LLM评估器中仍存在。

Conclusion: 不存在“完美指标”，应根据具体任务需求选择适当的评估指标，采用互补性评估方法。新指标开发应重点关注改进验证方法论。

Abstract: Evaluating Natural Language Generation (NLG) is crucial for the practical
adoption of AI, but has been a longstanding research challenge. While human
evaluation is considered the de-facto standard, it is expensive and lacks
scalability. Practical applications have driven the development of various
automatic evaluation metrics (AEM), designed to compare the model output with
human-written references, generating a score which approximates human judgment.
Over time, AEMs have evolved from simple lexical comparisons, to semantic
similarity models and, more recently, to LLM-based evaluators. However, it
seems that no single metric has emerged as a definitive solution, resulting in
studies using different ones without fully considering the implications. This
paper aims to show this by conducting a thorough examination of the
methodologies of existing metrics, their documented strengths and limitations,
validation methods, and correlations with human judgment. We identify several
key challenges: metrics often capture only specific aspects of text quality,
their effectiveness varies by task and dataset, validation practices remain
unstructured, and correlations with human judgment are inconsistent.
Importantly, we find that these challenges persist in the most recent type of
metric, LLM-as-a-Judge, as well as in the evaluation of Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG), an increasingly relevant task in academia and industry. Our
findings challenge the quest for the 'perfect metric'. We propose selecting
metrics based on task-specific needs and leveraging complementary evaluations
and advocate that new metrics should focus on enhanced validation
methodologies.

Abstract: This study explores the integration of Building Information Modeling (BIM)
with Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automate the extraction of
requirements from unstructured French Building Technical Specification (BTS)
documents within the construction industry. Employing Named Entity Recognition
(NER) and Relation Extraction (RE) techniques, the study leverages the
transformer-based model CamemBERT and applies transfer learning with the French
language model Fr\_core\_news\_lg, both pre-trained on a large French corpus in
the general domain. To benchmark these models, additional approaches ranging
from rule-based to deep learning-based methods are developed. For RE, four
different supervised models, including Random Forest, are implemented using a
custom feature vector. A hand-crafted annotated dataset is used to compare the
effectiveness of NER approaches and RE models. Results indicate that CamemBERT
and Fr\_core\_news\_lg exhibited superior performance in NER, achieving
F1-scores over 90\%, while Random Forest proved most effective in RE, with an
F1 score above 80\%. The outcomes are intended to be represented as a knowledge
graph in future work to further enhance automatic verification systems.

TL;DR: MME-SCI是一个针对多模态大语言模型的多语言科学推理基准测试，覆盖数学、物理、化学、生物四大学科，支持五种语言，包含1019个高质量问答对，测试显示现有模型在该基准上表现显著较差


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有科学领域基准测试存在三个关键挑战：多语言场景下推理能力评估不足、多模态覆盖不充分、科学知识点标注粒度不够细

Method: 收集1019个高质量问答对，涵盖4个学科和5种语言，设计3种评估模式，对16个开源模型和4个闭源模型进行广泛实验

Result: 测试结果显示该基准具有较高难度，例如o4-mini在仅图像模式下四个学科的准确率分别为52.11%、24.73%、36.57%和29.80%，显著低于现有基准表现

Conclusion: MME-SCI是一个全面且具有挑战性的基准，能够深入分析现有模型在特定领域的弱点，为多模态大语言模型的科学推理能力评估提供了重要工具

Abstract: Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved significant
advancements across various domains, and corresponding evaluation benchmarks
have been continuously refined and improved. In this process, benchmarks in the
scientific domain have played an important role in assessing the reasoning
capabilities of MLLMs. However, existing benchmarks still face three key
challenges: 1) Insufficient evaluation of models' reasoning abilities in
multilingual scenarios; 2) Inadequate assessment of MLLMs' comprehensive
modality coverage; 3) Lack of fine-grained annotation of scientific knowledge
points. To address these gaps, we propose MME-SCI, a comprehensive and
challenging benchmark. We carefully collected 1,019 high-quality
question-answer pairs, which involve 3 distinct evaluation modes. These pairs
cover four subjects, namely mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology, and
support five languages: Chinese, English, French, Spanish, and Japanese. We
conducted extensive experiments on 16 open-source models and 4 closed-source
models, and the results demonstrate that MME-SCI is widely challenging for
existing MLLMs. For instance, under the Image-only evaluation mode, o4-mini
achieved accuracy of only 52.11%, 24.73%, 36.57%, and 29.80% in mathematics,
physics, chemistry, and biology, respectively, indicating a significantly
higher difficulty level compared to existing benchmarks. More importantly,
using MME-SCI's multilingual and fine-grained knowledge attributes, we analyzed
existing models' performance in depth and identified their weaknesses in
specific domains. The Data and Evaluation Code are available at

Motivation: 酒店业需要理解影响客户评分的因素来提升客户满意度和业务表现，传统NLP方法在可解释性和计算效率方面存在局限。

Method: 将文本评论提取为(主语,谓语,宾语)三元组并关联情感得分构建知识图谱，使用Node2Vec图嵌入和机器学习分类器进行评分预测。

Result: 在HotelRec数据集上，ReviewGraph性能与大语言模型相当，优于传统NLP基线方法，在Cohen's Kappa等一致性指标上表现更好，且计算成本更低。

Conclusion: 基于图的表示方法在评论分析中具有潜力，为未来集成图神经网络和微调LLM提取方法的研究奠定了基础，框架已开源。

Abstract: In the hospitality industry, understanding the factors that drive customer
review ratings is critical for improving guest satisfaction and business
performance. This work proposes ReviewGraph for Review Rating Prediction (RRP),
a novel framework that transforms textual customer reviews into knowledge
graphs by extracting (subject, predicate, object) triples and associating
sentiment scores. Using graph embeddings (Node2Vec) and sentiment features, the
framework predicts review rating scores through machine learning classifiers.
We compare ReviewGraph performance with traditional NLP baselines (such as Bag
of Words, TF-IDF, and Word2Vec) and large language models (LLMs), evaluating
them in the HotelRec dataset. In comparison to the state of the art literature,
our proposed model performs similar to their best performing model but with
lower computational cost (without ensemble).
  While ReviewGraph achieves comparable predictive performance to LLMs and
outperforms baselines on agreement-based metrics such as Cohen's Kappa, it
offers additional advantages in interpretability, visual exploration, and
potential integration into Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. This
work highlights the potential of graph-based representations for enhancing
review analytics and lays the groundwork for future research integrating
advanced graph neural networks and fine-tuned LLM-based extraction methods. We
will share ReviewGraph output and platform open-sourced on our GitHub page

Motivation: 解决现有方法使用合成数据增强LLM长上下文能力时面临的数据多样性不足和事实不一致问题。

Method: 将上下文块视为MAB的臂，基于预期奖励分数选择块输入LLM生成响应，根据奖励反馈迭代更新分数，最后使用DPO方法优化LLM。

Conclusion: LongMab-PO框架通过探索-利用机制有效识别关键上下文片段，为长上下文建模提供了高质量的偏好数据生成方案。

Abstract: Long-context modeling is critical for a wide range of real-world tasks,
including long-context question answering, summarization, and complex reasoning
tasks. Recent studies have explored fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs)
with synthetic data to enhance their long-context capabilities. However, the
effectiveness of such approaches is often limited by the low diversity and
factual inconsistencies in the generated data. To address these challenges, we
propose LongMab-PO, a novel framework that leverages a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB)
rollout strategy to identify the most informative chunks from the given long
context for sampling high-quality and diverse responses and constructing
preference data pairs for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training.
Specifically, we treat context chunks as arms of MAB, select chunks based on
their expected reward scores to input into LLMs to generate responses, and
iteratively update these scores based on reward feedback. This exploration and
exploitation process enables the model to focus on the most relevant context
segments, thereby generating and collecting high-quality and diverse responses.
Finally, we collect these generated responses from the rollout process and
apply the DPO method to further optimize the LLM. Experimental results show
that LongMab-PO significantly improves the diversity and quality of preference
data pairs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on long-context reasoning
benchmarks. All code and data will be released on

TL;DR: 提出SvS策略，通过自对弈和变分问题合成来维持策略熵，解决RLVR训练中多样性下降的问题，显著提升Pass@k性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准RLVR训练在提高Pass@1性能的同时会导致策略熵下降，减少生成多样性，限制Pass@k性能的上限

Method: 提出在线自对弈变分问题合成(SvS)策略，利用策略的正确解合成变分问题，保持参考答案不变，有效维持训练过程中的策略熵

Result: 在AIME24和AIME25基准上Pass@32性能分别获得18.3%和22.8%的绝对提升，在3B到32B不同模型规模的12个推理基准上一致展示出泛化性和鲁棒性

Conclusion: SvS策略通过维持策略熵有效解决了RLVR训练中的多样性问题，显著提升了LLM在复杂推理任务中的Pass@k性能

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
a key paradigm for post-training Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly for
complex reasoning tasks. However, vanilla RLVR training has been shown to
improve Pass@1 performance at the expense of policy entropy, leading to reduced
generation diversity and limiting the Pass@k performance, which typically
represents the upper bound of LLM reasoning capability. In this paper, we
systematically analyze the policy's generation diversity from the perspective
of training problems and find that augmenting and updating training problems
helps mitigate entropy collapse during training. Based on these observations,
we propose an online Self-play with Variational problem Synthesis (SvS)
strategy for RLVR training, which uses the policy's correct solutions to
synthesize variational problems while ensuring their reference answers remain
identical to the originals. This self-improving strategy effectively maintains
policy entropy during training and substantially improves Pass@k compared with
standard RLVR, sustaining prolonged improvements and achieving absolute gains
of 18.3% and 22.8% in Pass@32 performance on the competition-level AIME24 and
AIME25 benchmarks. Experiments on 12 reasoning benchmarks across varying model
sizes from 3B to 32B consistently demonstrate the generalizability and
robustness of SvS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在演变为能够规划和交互的智能体系统时，通常通过微调来提升任务执行能力，但这一过程经常忽视安全性问题，导致原本对齐的模型可能变得不对齐，更容易执行有害任务。

Method: 提出Prefix INjection Guard (PING)方法，采用迭代方式：(1)生成候选前缀；(2)选择那些既能优化任务性能又能增强拒绝行为的前缀，将这些自然语言前缀预置到智能体响应中。

Result: 实验结果表明PING显著提升了微调后LLM智能体的安全性，且不牺牲其有效性。在网页导航和代码生成任务中，PING始终优于现有的提示方法，线性探针分析显示前缀标记对行为修改至关重要。

Conclusion: PING是一种简单有效的安全增强方法，通过自然语言前缀注入能够有效引导LLM智能体拒绝有害请求，同时保持任务性能，为解决智能体微调中的安全隐患提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Beyond simple text generation, Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved into
agentic systems capable of planning and interacting with external tools to
solve complex tasks. This evolution involves fine-tuning LLMs on agent-specific
tasks to enhance their proficiency. However, safety concerns are frequently
overlooked during this fine-tuning process. In this work, we show that aligned
LLMs can become unintentionally misaligned, leading to a higher likelihood of
executing harmful tasks and a reduced tendency to refuse them when fine-tuned
to execute agentic tasks. To address these safety challenges, we propose Prefix
INjection Guard (PING), a simple yet effective method that prepends
automatically generated natural language prefixes to agent responses, guiding
them to refuse harmful requests while preserving performance on benign tasks.
Specifically, we introduce an iterative approach that alternates between (1)
generating candidate prefixes and (2) selecting those that optimize both task
performance and refusal behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that PING
significantly enhances the safety of fine-tuned LLM agents without sacrificing
their effectiveness. PING consistently outperforms existing prompting
approaches across diverse benchmarks in both web navigation and code generation
tasks. Our analysis of internal hidden states via linear probes reveals that
prefix tokens are crucial for behavior modification, explaining the performance
gains. WARNING: This paper contains contents that are unethical or offensive in

Abstract: Digital health analytics face critical challenges nowadays. The sophisticated
analysis of patient-generated health content, which contains complex emotional
and medical contexts, requires scarce domain expertise, while traditional ML
approaches are constrained by data shortage and privacy limitations in
healthcare settings. Online Health Communities (OHCs) exemplify these
challenges with mixed-sentiment posts, clinical terminology, and implicit
emotional expressions that demand specialised knowledge for accurate Sentiment
Analysis (SA). To address these challenges, this study explores how Large
Language Models (LLMs) can integrate expert knowledge through in-context
learning for SA, providing a scalable solution for sophisticated health data
analysis. Specifically, we develop a structured codebook that systematically
encodes expert interpretation guidelines, enabling LLMs to apply
domain-specific knowledge through targeted prompting rather than extensive
training. Six GPT models validated alongside DeepSeek and LLaMA 3.1 are
compared with pre-trained language models (BioBERT variants) and lexicon-based
methods, using 400 expert-annotated posts from two OHCs. LLMs achieve superior
performance while demonstrating expert-level agreement. This high agreement,
with no statistically significant difference from inter-expert agreement
levels, suggests knowledge integration beyond surface-level pattern
recognition. The consistent performance across diverse LLM models, supported by
in-context learning, offers a promising solution for digital health analytics.
This approach addresses the critical challenge of expert knowledge shortage in
digital health research, enabling real-time, expert-quality analysis for
patient monitoring, intervention assessment, and evidence-based health
strategies.

Conclusion: CoA框架能够在单个模型中实现高效的多机器协作，为机器人模型研究提供了坚实基础，并完全开源代码、模型和数据

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and multi-agent systems have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex problem-solving tasks such as
deep research, vibe coding, and mathematical reasoning. However, most existing
multi-agent systems are built upon manual prompt/workflow engineering with
sophisticated agent frameworks, making them computationally inefficient, less
capable, and can not benefit from data-centric learning. In this work, we
introduce Chain-of-Agents (CoA), a novel paradigm of LLM reasoning that enables
native end-to-end complex problem-solving in the same way as a multi-agent
system (i.e., multi-turn problem solving with multiple tools and multiple
agents) within one model. In chain-of-agents problem-solving, the model
dynamically activates different tool agents and role-playing agents to simulate
multi-agent collaboration in an end-to-end fashion. To elicit end-to-end
chain-of-agents problem-solving abilities in LLMs, we introduce a multi-agent
distillation framework to distill state-of-the-art multi-agent systems into
chain-of-agents trajectories for agentic supervised fine-tuning. We then use
agentic reinforcement learning on verifiable agentic tasks to further improve
the models' capabilities on chain-of-agents problem solving. We call the
resulting models Agent Foundation Models (AFMs). Our empirical studies
demonstrate that AFM establishes new state-of-the-art performance across
diverse benchmarks in both web agent and code agent settings. We make the
entire research, including the model weights, code for training and evaluation,
and the training data, fully open-sourced, which offers a solid starting point
for future research on agent models and agentic RL.

tokens. We propose Cognitive Workspace, a novel paradigm that transcends
traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by emulating human cognitive
mechanisms of external memory use. Drawing from cognitive science foundations
including Baddeley's working memory model, Clark's extended mind thesis, and
Hutchins' distributed cognition framework, we demonstrate that current passive
retrieval systems fail to capture the dynamic, task-driven nature of human
memory management. Our analysis of 2024-2025 developments reveals that while
techniques like Infini-attention and StreamingLLM achieve impressive context
lengths, they lack the metacognitive awareness and active planning capabilities
essential for true cognitive extension. Cognitive Workspace addresses these
limitations through three core innovations: (1) active memory management with
deliberate information curation, (2) hierarchical cognitive buffers enabling
persistent working states, and (3) task-driven context optimization that
dynamically adapts to cognitive demands. Empirical validation demonstrates
Cognitive Workspace achieves an average 58.6% memory reuse rate (ranging from
54-60% across different tasks) compared to 0% for traditional RAG, with 17-18%
net efficiency gain despite 3.3x higher operation counts. Statistical analysis
confirms these advantages with p < 0.001 and Cohen's d > 23 across multiple
task types, establishing the first quantitative evidence for active memory
superiority in LLM systems. We present a comprehensive theoretical framework
synthesizing insights from 50+ recent papers, positioning Cognitive Workspace
as a fundamental shift from information retrieval to genuine cognitive
augmentation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出AlphaEval评估框架，解决传统回测和相关性指标在alpha挖掘中的限制，通过五维度评估提高效率和评估全面性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有alpha挖掘评估方法存在显著缺陷：回测计算粗重、效率低且效果受参数影响；相关性指标只考虑预测能力而忽视其他重要特性，且闭源模型影响可复现性

Method: 设计AlphaEval框架，从五个维度评传alpha质量：预测能力、稳定性、市场干扰程度、金融逻辑和多样性，支持并行化计算且无需回测

Result: 实验表明AlphaEval评估一致性与全面回测相当，但更高效并提供更全面的洞察，能够更有效识别优秀alpha，并开源代码促进可复现性

Conclusion: AlphaEval为自动化alpha挖掘提供了统一、高效、全面的评估方案，充分考虑了alpha的多维度质量特征，有助于推动该领域的可复现性和社区发展

Abstract: Formula alpha mining, which generates predictive signals from financial data,
is critical for quantitative investment. Although various algorithmic
approaches-such as genetic programming, reinforcement learning, and large
language models-have significantly expanded the capacity for alpha discovery,
systematic evaluation remains a key challenge. Existing evaluation metrics
predominantly include backtesting and correlation-based measures. Backtesting
is computationally intensive, inherently sequential, and sensitive to specific
strategy parameters. Correlation-based metrics, though efficient, assess only
predictive ability and overlook other crucial properties such as temporal
stability, robustness, diversity, and interpretability. Additionally, the
closed-source nature of most existing alpha mining models hinders
reproducibility and slows progress in this field. To address these issues, we
propose AlphaEval, a unified, parallelizable, and backtest-free evaluation
framework for automated alpha mining models. AlphaEval assesses the overall
quality of generated alphas along five complementary dimensions: predictive
power, stability, robustness to market perturbations, financial logic, and
diversity. Extensive experiments across representative alpha mining algorithms
demonstrate that AlphaEval achieves evaluation consistency comparable to
comprehensive backtesting, while providing more comprehensive insights and
higher efficiency. Furthermore, AlphaEval effectively identifies superior
alphas compared to traditional single-metric screening approaches. All
implementations and evaluation tools are open-sourced to promote
reproducibility and community engagement.

Result: 精确确定了各种语言的计算复杂度，设计了相应的算法，分析了拟合本体的规模大小，并发现某些TGD类不存在有限基。

Conclusion: 不同本体和约束语言在拟合问题和有限基存在性方面表现出显著差异，为自动化知识获取提供了理论基础和实用指导。

Abstract: We study the problem of fitting ontologies and constraints to positive and
negative examples that take the form of a finite relational structure. As
ontology and constraint languages, we consider the description logics
$\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu L}$ and $\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu LI}$ as well as several
classes of tuple-generating dependencies (TGDs): full, guarded,
frontier-guarded, frontier-one, and unrestricted TGDs as well as inclusion
dependencies. We pinpoint the exact computational complexity, design
algorithms, and analyze the size of fitting ontologies and TGDs. We also
investigate the related problem of constructing a finite basis of concept
inclusions / TGDs for a given set of finite structures. While finite bases
exist for $\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu L}$, $\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu LI}$, guarded TGDs,
and inclusion dependencies, they in general do not exist for full,
frontier-guarded and frontier-one TGDs.

Motivation: 提升文本到SQL模型在真实应用中的基础能力和泛化能力，特别是在处理WHERE子句语义解析时减少对条件列数据和人工标注训练数据的依赖

Method: 整合模型可解释性分析与执行引导策略，采用过滤调整、逻辑关联精炼和模型融合技术，设计条件增强的CESQL模型

Result: 在WikiSQL数据集上表现优异，显著提高了预测结果的准确性，同时降低了对条件列数据和人工标注数据的依赖

Conclusion: 这项研究为处理复杂查询和真实数据库环境中不规则数据场景的研究提供了新的视角和方法

Abstract: To elevate the foundational capabilities and generalization prowess of the
text-to-SQL model in real-world applications, we integrate model
interpretability analysis with execution-guided strategy for semantic parsing
of WHERE clauses in SQL queries. Furthermore, we augment this approach with
filtering adjustments, logical correlation refinements, and model fusion,
culminating in the design of the CESQL model that facilitates conditional
enhancement. Our model excels on the WikiSQL dataset, which is emblematic of
single-table database query tasks, markedly boosting the accuracy of prediction
outcomes. When predicting conditional values in WHERE clauses, we have not only
minimized our dependence on data within the condition columns of tables but
also circumvented the impact of manually labeled training data. Our hope is
that this endeavor to enhance accuracy in processing basic database queries
will offer fresh perspectives for research into handling complex queries and
scenarios featuring irregular data in real-world database environments.

TL;DR: 搜索基于LLM代理的评估存在搜索时污染问题，导致代理可以从HuggingFace等平台直接获取测试数据集的答案，从而影响评测结果的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别和探讨搜索基于LLM代理评估中的新型污染问题，这种污染会导致代理通过搜索直接获取测试数据的答案，而非通过真正的推理能力来回答问题，从而影响评测的公正性和有效性。

Method: 在三个常用能力测试集（HLE、SimpleQA、GPQA）上进行实验，分析搜索基于代理的访问日志，检测是否从HuggingFace等平台获取到包含测试问题和答案的数据源。通过阻塞HuggingFace进行对照实验，并进行消融实验来识别其他污染源。

Result: 约3%的测试问题可以通过搜索直接从HuggingFace获取到标签数据。阻塞HuggingFace后，污染子集的准确率下降约15%。还发现公开评估数据集可能不是唯一的污染源。

Conclusion: 提出了评测设计和结果报告的最佳实践，以应对这种新型污染问题，确保搜索基于LLM代理评估的可信过程。并公开实验日志以便审计评估结果。

Abstract: Data contamination refers to the leakage of evaluation data into model
training data, resulting in overfitting to supposedly held-out test sets and
compromising test validity. We identify an analogous issue, search-time
contamination (STC), in evaluating search-based LLM agents which use tools to
gather information from online sources when answering user queries. STC occurs
when the retrieval step surfaces a source containing the test question (or a
near-duplicate) alongside its answer, enabling agents to copy rather than
genuinely infer or reason, undermining benchmark integrity. We find that
HuggingFace, an online platform hosting evaluation datasets, appears among
retrieved sources in search based agent logs. Consequently, agents often
explicitly acknowledge discovering question answer pairs from HuggingFace
within their reasoning chains. On three commonly used capability benchmarks:
Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), SimpleQA, and GPQA, we demonstrate that for
approximately 3% of questions, search-based agents directly find the datasets
with ground truth labels on HuggingFace. When millions of evaluation queries
target the same benchmark, even small, repeated leaks can accelerate the
benchmark's obsolescence, shortening its intended lifecycle. After HuggingFace
is blocked, we observe a drop in accuracy on the contaminated subset of
approximately 15%. We further show through ablation experiments that publicly
accessible evaluation datasets on HuggingFace may not be the sole source of
STC. To this end, we conclude by proposing best practices for benchmark design
and result reporting to address this novel form of leakage and ensure
trustworthy evaluation of search-based LLM agents. To facilitate the auditing
of evaluation results, we also publicly release the complete logs from our
experiments.

TL;DR: QuickMerge是一个轻量级token合并框架，通过注意力范数动态选择重要token，使用基于熵的预算估计器，并引入轻量级transformer先验来保持自回归兼容性，显著减少计算token数量同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成模型在语言、视觉和视频领域处理更大输入，token级别的计算成本成为主要瓶颈。现有token选择方法大多是静态的、特定于模态的或不兼容自回归生成。

Method: 提出QuickMerge框架：1）基于注意力范数动态选择重要token；2）使用基于熵的预算估计器确定token数量；3）引入轻量级transformer先验在合并后的token序列上进行训练，保持自回归兼容性。

Result: 在多模态领域评估显示，QuickMerge在计算精度权衡方面取得一致改进，显著减少token数量，同时匹配甚至超过学习型tokenizer和固定patch基线的性能。

Conclusion: QuickMerge通过语义显著性估计、灵活token预算和自回归对齐的组合，实现了用更少token进行准确生成的有效方法，解决了token计算成本瓶颈问题。

Abstract: As generative models scale to larger inputs across language, vision, and
video domains, the cost of token-level computation has become a key bottleneck.
While prior work suggests that only a subset of tokens significantly influence
downstream predictions, most token selection methods are static,
modality-specific, or incompatible with autoregressive generation. In this
paper, we propose QuickMerge, a lightweight token merging framework designed
for efficient next-token prediction.
  QuickMerge dynamically selects a reduced number of tokens based on attention
norm magnitude, guided by an entropy-based budget estimator. To preserve
autoregressive compatibility, we introduce a lightweight transformer prior
trained over the merged token sequence. By combining semantic salience
estimation, flexible token budgets, and AR alignment, QuickMerge enables
accurate generation with fewer tokens.
  We evaluate QuickMerge across multi-modality domains, demonstrating
consistent improvements in compute-accuracy tradeoffs. Specifically, QuickMerge
reduces token counts sustantially while matching as well as exceeding the
performance of learned tokenizers and fixed-patch baselines.

Motivation: 研究在复杂战略决策中立即机会与长期目标的缺口，通过棋牌模型分析人类与AI在战略维度上的差异

Method: 提出基于网络的棋子互动指标来量化棋局战略紧张程度，比较人类vs人类和AIvsAI游戏的动态变化

Result: 竞争力最强的AI能持续更长时间维持更高的战略紧张水平，人类玩家在专业水平提升时战略紧张会突然增加，但仍限制游戏复杂性

Conclusion: AI能容忍长期攻防平衡的复杂局面，而人类可能因认知限制而采取适应性策略，这一差异对AI在复杂战略环境中的应用有重要意义

Abstract: Strategic decision-making involves managing the tension between immediate
opportunities and long-term objectives. We study this trade-off in chess by
characterizing and comparing dynamics between human vs human and AI vs AI
games. We propose a network-based metric of piece-to-piece interaction to
quantify the ongoing strategic tension on the board. Its evolution in games
reveals that the most competitive AI players sustain higher levels of strategic
tension for longer durations than elite human players. Cumulative tension
varies with algorithmic complexity for AI and correspondingly in human-played
games increases abruptly with expertise at about 1600 Elo and again at 2300
Elo. The profiles reveal different approaches. Highly competitive AI tolerates
interconnected positions balanced between offensive and defensive tactics over
long periods. Human play, in contrast, limits tension and game complexity,
which may reflect cognitive limitations and adaptive strategies. The difference
may have implications for AI usage in complex, strategic environments.

Conclusion: 该研究为解决个性化信息的多跳推理问题提供了系统性的任务定义、评估框架和有效方法，推动了基于记忆的个性化代理发展。

Abstract: In large language model-based agents, memory serves as a critical capability
for achieving personalization by storing and utilizing users' information.
Although some previous studies have adopted memory to implement user
personalization, they typically focus on preference alignment and simple
question-answering. However, in the real world, complex tasks often require
multi-hop reasoning on a large amount of user information, which poses
significant challenges for current memory approaches. To address this
limitation, we propose the multi-hop personalized reasoning task to explore how
different memory mechanisms perform in multi-hop reasoning over personalized
information. We explicitly define this task and construct a dataset along with
a unified evaluation framework. Then, we implement various explicit and
implicit memory methods and conduct comprehensive experiments. We evaluate
their performance on this task from multiple perspectives and analyze their
strengths and weaknesses. Besides, we explore hybrid approaches that combine
both paradigms and propose the HybridMem method to address their limitations.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model through extensive
experiments. To benefit the research community, we release this project at

Result: 相比多模态模型直接提取，DIVE将准确率和覆盖率提升10-15%（商业模型）和30%以上（开源模型），建立了包含4,000篇文献30,000条数据的数据库，能在2分钟内识别未报道的氢存储成分

Conclusion: DIVE工作流和智能体设计可广泛适用于不同材料，为AI驱动的材料发现提供了新范式

Abstract: Data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) approaches are fundamentally
transforming the discovery of new materials. Despite the unprecedented
availability of materials data in the scientific literature, much of this
information remains trapped in unstructured figures and tables, hindering the
construction of large language model (LLM)-based AI agent for automated
materials design. Here, we present the Descriptive Interpretation of Visual
Expression (DIVE) multi-agent workflow, which systematically reads and
organizes experimental data from graphical elements in scientific literatures.
We focus on solid-state hydrogen storage materials-a class of materials central
to future clean-energy technologies and demonstrate that DIVE markedly improves
the accuracy and coverage of data extraction compared to the direct extraction
by multimodal models, with gains of 10-15% over commercial models and over 30%
relative to open-source models. Building on a curated database of over 30,000
entries from 4,000 publications, we establish a rapid inverse design workflow
capable of identifying previously unreported hydrogen storage compositions in
two minutes. The proposed AI workflow and agent design are broadly transferable
across diverse materials, providing a paradigm for AI-driven materials
discovery.

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the foremost cause of mortality
worldwide, a burden worsened by a severe deficit of healthcare workers.
Artificial intelligence (AI) agents have shown potential to alleviate this gap
via automated early detection and proactive screening, yet their clinical
application remains limited by: 1) prompt-based clinical role assignment that
relies on intrinsic model capabilities without domain-specific tool support; or
2) rigid sequential workflows, whereas clinical care often requires adaptive
reasoning that orders specific tests and, based on their results, guides
personalised next steps; 3) general and static knowledge bases without
continuous learning capability; and 4) fixed unimodal or bimodal inputs and
lack of on-demand visual outputs when further clarification is needed. In
response, a multimodal framework, CardAIc-Agents, was proposed to augment
models with external tools and adaptively support diverse cardiac tasks.
Specifically, a CardiacRAG agent generated general plans from updatable cardiac
knowledge, while the chief agent integrated tools to autonomously execute these
plans and deliver decisions. To enable adaptive and case-specific
customization, a stepwise update strategy was proposed to dynamically refine
plans based on preceding execution results, once the task was assessed as
complex. In addition, a multidisciplinary discussion tool was introduced to
interpret challenging cases, thereby supporting further adaptation. When
clinicians raised concerns, visual review panels were provided to assist final
validation. Experiments across three datasets showed the efficiency of
CardAIc-Agents compared to mainstream Vision-Language Models (VLMs),
state-of-the-art agentic systems, and fine-tuned VLMs.

Motivation: 现有的基于LLM的自动启发式设计方法存在静态算子和缺乏知识积累机制的问题，限制了其有效性。

Method: 提出HiFo-Prompt框架，包含两种协同提示策略：前瞻策略基于种群动态自适应引导搜索，管理探索-利用权衡；后瞻策略从过去世代的成功启发式中提炼可重用的设计原则，构建持久知识库。

Result: 实验结果表明HiFo-Prompt显著优于最先进的基于LLM的AHD方法，生成更高质量的启发式，同时实现更快的收敛速度和更好的查询效率。

Conclusion: HiFo-Prompt通过前瞻和后瞻的双重机制，成功将瞬时发现转化为持久知识，使LLM能够从自身经验中学习，为自动启发式设计提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: LLM-based Automatic Heuristic Design (AHD) within Evolutionary Computation
(EC) frameworks has shown promising results. However, its effectiveness is
hindered by the use of static operators and the lack of knowledge accumulation
mechanisms. We introduce HiFo-Prompt, a framework that guides LLMs with two
synergistic prompting strategies: Foresight and Hindsight. Foresight-based
prompts adaptively steer the search based on population dynamics, managing the
exploration-exploitation trade-off. In addition, hindsight-based prompts mimic
human expertise by distilling successful heuristics from past generations into
fundamental, reusable design principles. This dual mechanism transforms
transient discoveries into a persistent knowledge base, enabling the LLM to
learn from its own experience. Empirical results demonstrate that HiFo-Prompt
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based AHD methods, generating
higher-quality heuristics while achieving substantially faster convergence and
superior query efficiency.

TL;DR: LOOP是一个新颖的神经符号规划框架，通过神经网络和符号组件之间的迭代对话来解决复杂规划问题，在标准基准测试中达到85.8%的成功率，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的神经规划方法在复杂领域存在缺失前提条件、目标不一致和幻觉问题，而经典规划器缺乏灵活性和自然语言理解能力。现有神经符号方法采用一次性翻译方式，未能充分利用神经和符号组件的协同作用。

Method: LOOP将规划视为神经和符号组件之间的迭代对话，集成了13个协调的神经特征，包括图神经网络处理空间关系、多智能体验证确保共识正确性、分层分解管理复杂任务，以及从成功和失败中学习的因果记忆。

Result: 在六个标准IPC基准领域评估中，LOOP达到85.8%的成功率，显著优于LLM+P（55.0%）、LLM-as-Planner（19.2%）和Tree-of-Thoughts（3.3%）。

Conclusion: 可靠规划的关键不在于选择神经网络还是符号推理器，而在于让它们在整个过程真正"对话"。LOOP为构建可信赖的自主系统提供了全面蓝图。

Abstract: Planning is one of the most critical tasks in autonomous systems, where even
a small error can lead to major failures or million-dollar losses. Current
state-of-the-art neural planning approaches struggle with complex domains,
producing plans with missing preconditions, inconsistent goals, and
hallucinations. While classical planners provide logical guarantees, they lack
the flexibility and natural language understanding capabilities needed for
modern autonomous systems. Existing neuro-symbolic approaches use one-shot
translation from natural language to formal plans, missing the opportunity for
neural and symbolic components to work and refine solutions together. To
address this gap, we develop LOOP -- a novel neuro-symbolic planning framework
that treats planning as an iterative conversation between neural and symbolic
components rather than simple translation. LOOP integrates 13 coordinated
neural features including graph neural networks for spatial relationships,
multi-agent validation for consensus-based correctness, hierarchical
decomposition for complex task management, and causal memory that learns from
both successes and failures. Unlike existing approaches, LOOP generates PDDL
specifications, refines them iteratively based on symbolic feedback, and builds
a causal knowledge base from execution traces. LOOP was evaluated on six
standard IPC benchmark domains, where it achieved 85.8% success rate compared
to LLM+P (55.0%), LLM-as-Planner (19.2%), and Tree-of-Thoughts (3.3%). This
work shows that the key to reliable planning is not in choosing between neural
networks or symbolic reasoners but it lies in making them actually ``talk'' to
each other during the entire process. LOOP provides a thorough blueprint for
building autonomous systems that can finally be trusted with critical
real-world applications.

TL;DR: SPANER是一个模态无关的参数高效微调框架，通过共享提示机制将不同模态输入嵌入到统一语义空间，提升跨模态泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态PEFT方法主要关注任务特定性能提升，但忽略了多模态嵌入空间的结构，导致模态特定表示孤立，限制了跨模态泛化能力。

Method: 提出SPANER框架，采用共享提示机制作为概念锚点，使语义相关实例在空间中收敛，支持无缝集成额外模态（如音频）而无需改变核心架构。

Result: 在视觉-语言和音频-视觉基准测试中，SPANER展示了竞争力的少样本检索性能，同时在学习嵌入空间中保持了高语义一致性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了对齐嵌入结构（而非仅仅调整适配器权重）对于可扩展多模态学习的重要性，SPANER为多模态表示学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) have
significantly improved performance on downstream tasks such as few-shot
retrieval. However, most existing approaches focus on task-specific gains while
neglecting the structure of the multimodal embedding space. As a result,
modality-specific representations often remain isolated, limiting cross-modal
generalisation. In this work, we introduce Shared Prompt AligNER (SPANER), a
modality-agnostic PEFT framework designed to embed inputs from diverse
modalities into a unified semantic space. At its core, SPANER employs a shared
prompt mechanism that acts as a conceptual anchor, enabling semantically
related instances to converge spatially regardless of modality. This shared
prompt design is inherently extensible, supporting the seamless integration of
additional modalities, such as audio, without altering the core architecture.
Through comprehensive experiments across vision-language and audio-visual
benchmarks, SPANER demonstrates competitive few-shot retrieval performance
while preserving high semantic coherence in the learned embedding space. Our
results highlight the importance of aligning embedding structures, rather than
merely tuning adapter weights, for scalable multimodal learning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TASER是一个持续学习的智能表格提取系统，专门处理现实世界中高度非结构化的多页金融表格，通过模式引导的提取和推荐机制，在表格检测性能上比现有模型提升10.1%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实金融文档中的表格信息通常被埋藏在混乱、多页、碎片化的表格中（99.4%的表格没有边界框），需要专门的方法来提取和规范化这些高度非结构化的金融持仓信息。

Method: 开发了TASER系统，包含表格检测、分类、提取和推荐代理，利用初始模式执行提取，然后通过推荐代理审查输出、建议模式修订并决定最终推荐，实现持续学习。

Result: TASER在表格检测上比Table Transformer提升10.1%，大批量处理使可操作的模式建议增加104.3%，提取持仓量增加9.8。构建了包含22,584页、3,213个表格、7,315亿美元持仓的真实金融数据集TASERTab。

Conclusion: 基于代理的模式引导提取系统在理解现实世界金融表格方面展现出巨大潜力，持续学习过程对于提升提取性能至关重要。

Abstract: Real-world financial documents report essential information about an entity's
financial holdings that can span millions of different financial instrument
types. Yet, these details are often buried in messy, multi-page, fragmented
tables - for example, 99.4% of the tables in our dataset have no bounding boxes
with the maximum number of rows amounting to 426 per table across 44 pages. To
tackle these unique challenges from real-world tables, we present a
continuously learning, agentic table extraction system, TASER (Table Agents for
Schema-guided Extraction and Recommendation) that extracts highly unstructured,
multi-page, heterogeneous tables into normalized, schema-conforming outputs.
Our table agents execute on table detection, classification, extraction, and
recommendations by leveraging an initial schema. Then, our Recommender Agent
reviews the outputs, recommends schema revisions, and decides on the final
recommendations, enabling TASER to outperform existing table detection models
such as Table Transformer by 10.1%. Within this continuous learning process, we
highlight that larger batch sizes result in a 104.3% increase in schema
recommendations that are actionable and utilized, resulting in a 9.8% increase
in extracted holdings - highlighting the importance of a continuous learning
process. To train TASER, we have manually labeled 22,584 pages (28,150,449
tokens), 3,213 tables for $731,685,511,687 of holdings culminating in one of
the first real financial table datasets. We release our dataset TASERTab to
enable the research community to access real-world financial tables and
outputs. Our results highlight the promise of agentic, schema-guided extraction
systems for robust understanding of real-world financial tables.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems are transforming scientific discovery by
accelerating specific research tasks, from protein structure prediction to
materials design, yet remain confined to narrow domains requiring substantial
human oversight. The exponential growth of scientific literature and increasing
domain specialisation constrain researchers' capacity to synthesise knowledge
across disciplines and develop unifying theories, motivating exploration of
more general-purpose AI systems for science. Here we show that a
domain-agnostic, agentic AI system can independently navigate the scientific
workflow - from hypothesis generation through data collection to manuscript
preparation. The system autonomously designed and executed three psychological
studies on visual working memory, mental rotation, and imagery vividness,
executed one new online data collection with 288 participants, developed
analysis pipelines through 8-hour+ continuous coding sessions, and produced
completed manuscripts. The results demonstrate the capability of AI scientific
discovery pipelines to conduct non-trivial research with theoretical reasoning
and methodological rigour comparable to experienced researchers, though with
limitations in conceptual nuance and theoretical interpretation. This is a step
toward embodied AI that can test hypotheses through real-world experiments,
accelerating discovery by autonomously exploring regions of scientific space
that human cognitive and resource constraints might otherwise leave unexplored.
It raises important questions about the nature of scientific understanding and
the attribution of scientific credit.

Result: 在语言模型量化中比现有方法提高14%，离散旋转成像中降低16%重建误差并加速6倍，FIR滤波器设计中浮动减少50%

Conclusion: DMMV作为一个通用的上下文无关优化问题形式具有重要价值，提出的GPU加速吧啦算法在多个领域都取得显著成效

Abstract: We introduce the Discrete Min-Max Violation (DMMV) as a general optimization
problem which seeks an assignment of discrete values to variables that
minimizes the largest constraint violation. This context-free mathematical
formulation is applicable to a wide range of use cases that have worst-case
performance requirements. After defining the DMMV problem mathematically, we
explore its properties to establish a foundational understanding. To tackle
DMMV instance sizes of practical relevance, we develop a GPU-accelerated
heuristic that takes advantage of the mathematical properties of DMMV for
speeding up the solution process. We demonstrate the versatile applicability of
our heuristic by solving three optimization problems as use cases: (1)
post-training quantization of language models, (2) discrete tomography, and (3)
Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter design. In quantization without outlier
separation, our heuristic achieves 14% improvement on average over existing
methods. In discrete tomography, it reduces reconstruction error by 16% under
uniform noise and accelerates computations by a factor of 6 on GPU. For FIR
filter design, it nearly achieves 50% ripple reduction compared to using the
commercial integer optimization solver, Gurobi. Our comparative results point
to the benefits of studying DMMV as a context-free optimization problem and the
advantages that our proposed heuristic offers on three distinct problems. Our
GPU-accelerated heuristic will be made open-source to further stimulate
research on DMMV and its other applications. The code is available at

Motivation: 语言模型代理在安全关键场景中存在严重风险，虽然具备风险知识但在实际执行时无法有效应用这些知识，存在认知与执行的差距。

Method: 开发了包含三个维度的综合评估框架：风险知识、风险识别能力和风险规避行为。基于发现的性能差距，设计了独立的风险验证器和抽象器系统来批判代理的拟执行操作。

Result: 评估显示代理风险知识通过率>98%，但实际风险识别性能下降>23%，危险操作执行通过率<26%。风险验证器系统将危险操作执行率降低了55.3%。

Conclusion: 单纯扩展模型能力或推理计算无法解决安全问题，需要专门的安全机制。风险验证器方法能有效弥补认知与执行之间的差距，显著提升代理安全性。

Abstract: Language model (LM) agents have demonstrated significant potential for
automating real-world tasks, yet they pose a diverse array of potential, severe
risks in safety-critical scenarios. In this work, we identify a significant gap
between LM agents' risk awareness and safety execution abilities: while they
often answer "Yes" to queries like "Is executing `sudo rm -rf /*' dangerous?",
they will likely fail to identify such risks in instantiated trajectories or
even directly perform these risky actions when acting as agents. To
systematically investigate this, we develop a comprehensive evaluation
framework to examine agents' safety across three progressive dimensions: 1)
their knowledge about potential risks, 2) their ability to identify
corresponding risks in execution trajectories, and 3) their actual behaviors to
avoid executing these risky actions. Our evaluation reveals two critical
performance gaps that resemble the generator-validator gaps observed in LMs:
while agents demonstrate near-perfect risk knowledge ($>98\%$ pass rates), they
fail to apply this knowledge when identifying risks in actual scenarios (with
performance dropping by $>23\%$) and often still execute risky actions ($<26\%$
pass rates). Notably, this trend persists across more capable LMs as well as in
specialized reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1, indicating that simply scaling
model capabilities or inference compute does not inherently resolve safety
concerns. Instead, we take advantage of these observed gaps to develop a risk
verifier that independently critiques the proposed actions by agents, with an
abstractor that converts specific execution trajectories into abstract
descriptions where LMs can more effectively identify the risks. Our overall
system achieves a significant reduction of risky action execution by $55.3\%$
over vanilla-prompted agents.

Abstract: Developing general-purpose embodied agents is a core challenge in AI.
Minecraft provides rich complexity and internet-scale data, but its slow speed
and engineering overhead make it unsuitable for rapid prototyping. Crafter
offers a lightweight alternative that retains key challenges from Minecraft,
yet its use has remained limited to narrow tasks due to the absence of
foundation models that have driven progress in the Minecraft setting. In this
paper, we present CrafterDojo, a suite of foundation models and tools that
unlock the Crafter environment as a lightweight, prototyping-friendly, and
Minecraft-like testbed for general-purpose embodied agent research. CrafterDojo
addresses this by introducing CrafterVPT, CrafterCLIP, and CrafterSteve-1 for
behavior priors, vision-language grounding, and instruction following,
respectively. In addition, we provide toolkits for generating behavior and
caption datasets (CrafterPlay and CrafterCaption), reference agent
implementations, benchmark evaluations, and a complete open-source codebase.

Motivation: 大语言模型在医疗文本理解方面表现出色，但在基于电子健康记录的预测任务中表现不佳，因为难以处理时间结构化和高维数据。现有混合方法仅将LLM作为检索器，无法提升其内在推理能力

Method: 提出EAG-RL两阶段框架：1）使用专家引导的蒙特卡洛树搜索构建高质量推理轨迹初始化策略；2）通过强化学习将LLM注意力与专家模型识别的临床重要特征对齐

Result: 在两个真实世界EHR数据集上的实验显示，EAG-RL平均提升LLM内在EHR推理能力14.62%，同时增强了对特征扰动的鲁棒性和对未见临床领域的泛化能力

Conclusion: EAG-RL展示了在临床预测任务中实际部署的潜力，通过专家注意力指导有效提升了LLM的电子健康记录推理能力

Abstract: Improving large language models (LLMs) for electronic health record (EHR)
reasoning is essential for enabling accurate and generalizable clinical
predictions. While LLMs excel at medical text understanding, they underperform
on EHR-based prediction tasks due to challenges in modeling temporally
structured, high-dimensional data. Existing approaches often rely on hybrid
paradigms, where LLMs serve merely as frozen prior retrievers while downstream
deep learning (DL) models handle prediction, failing to improve the LLM's
intrinsic reasoning capacity and inheriting the generalization limitations of
DL models. To this end, we propose EAG-RL, a novel two-stage training framework
designed to intrinsically enhance LLMs' EHR reasoning ability through expert
attention guidance, where expert EHR models refer to task-specific DL models
trained on EHR data. Concretely, EAG-RL first constructs high-quality, stepwise
reasoning trajectories using expert-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search to
effectively initialize the LLM's policy. Then, EAG-RL further optimizes the
policy via reinforcement learning by aligning the LLM's attention with
clinically salient features identified by expert EHR models. Extensive
experiments on two real-world EHR datasets show that EAG-RL improves the
intrinsic EHR reasoning ability of LLMs by an average of 14.62%, while also
enhancing robustness to feature perturbations and generalization to unseen
clinical domains. These results demonstrate the practical potential of EAG-RL
for real-world deployment in clinical prediction tasks. Our code have been

Motivation: 当前强化学习在需要深入理解信息丰富图像和生成结构化输出的任务中应用不足。图表到代码生成任务需要复杂的视觉推理，仅靠监督微调效果有限，需要有效的强化学习策略来奖励结构化输出。

Method: 构建了包含300万真实arXiv图表-代码对的最大训练语料库，提出MSRL方法：1)文本级基于规则的奖励验证代码细节；2)视觉级基于模型的奖励通过渲染代码成图像并使用评估模型评估结构相似性；3)采用两阶段课程学习确保训练稳定性。

Result: MSRL显著突破了SFT的性能瓶颈，在ChartMimic和ReachQA基准测试上分别将高级指标提升了6.2%和9.9%，达到了与先进闭源模型竞争的性能水平。

Conclusion: 多模态结构化强化学习方法通过结合文本和视觉反馈的有效奖励机制，成功解决了图表到代码生成任务中的性能瓶颈问题，为复杂视觉推理任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective for general
reasoning in vision-language models, its application to tasks requiring
in-depth understanding of information-rich images and generation of structured
outputs remains underexplored. Chart-to-code generation exemplifies this
challenge, demanding complex reasoning over visual charts to generate
structured code. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) alone is often insufficient,
highlighting the need for effective RL strategies that appropriately reward
structured outputs. We systematically investigate the performance plateau in
SFT through large-scale experiments and propose Multimodal Structured
Reinforcement Learning (MSRL) for chart-to-code generation, which substantially
breaks through this plateau. We construct the largest training corpus to date,
containing 3 million chart-code pairs from real-world arXiv tables to mitigate
simplistic patterns of prior synthetic data. Despite reaching state-of-the-art
performance, our experiments show that scaling SFT data eventually hits a
plateau where further increases yield negligible improvements. Our MSRL method
leverages a multi-granularity structured reward system using multimodal textual
and visual feedback. At the textual level, rule-based rewards validate
fine-grained code details. At the visual level, model-based rewards assess
structural similarity by rendering generated code into images and employing an
evaluator model. We implement this within a two-stage curriculum for training
stability. Results demonstrate that MSRL significantly breaks the SFT plateau,
improving high-level metrics by 6.2% and 9.9% on ChartMimic and ReachQA
benchmarks respectively, achieving competitive performance with advanced
closed-source models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GUI定位方法依赖边界框或中心点回归，忽视了空间交互不确定性和视觉语义层次结构。现有注意力方法存在两个关键问题：背景区域处理不当导致注意力漂移，以及均匀标注无法区分目标UI元素的中心和边缘。

Method: 提出Valley-to-Peak (V2P)方法：1) 抑制注意力机制最小化模型对无关区域的关注；2) 基于Fitts定律的2D高斯热图建模，权重从中心向边缘逐渐递减，方差由目标大小决定。

Result: 在ScreenSpot-v2和ScreenSpot-Pro两个基准测试上分别达到92.3%和50.5%的性能。消融实验证实了各组件贡献，展示了V2P在精确GUI定位任务中的泛化能力。

Conclusion: V2P方法有效隔离目标区域并教导模型关注UI元素的最关键点，解决了GUI定位中的注意力漂移和点击不精确问题，为精确GUI定位任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Precise localization of GUI elements is crucial for the development of GUI
agents. Traditional methods rely on bounding box or center-point regression,
neglecting spatial interaction uncertainty and visual-semantic hierarchies.
Recent methods incorporate attention mechanisms but still face two key issues:
(1) ignoring processing background regions causes attention drift from the
desired area, and (2) uniform labeling fails to distinguish between center and
edges of the target UI element, leading to click imprecision. Inspired by how
humans visually process and interact with GUI elements, we propose the
Valley-to-Peak (V2P) method to address these issues. To mitigate background
distractions, V2P introduces a suppression attention mechanism that minimizes
the model's focus on irrelevant regions to highlight the intended region. For
the issue of center-edge distinction, V2P applies a Fitts' Law-inspired
approach by modeling GUI interactions as 2D Gaussian heatmaps where the weight
gradually decreases from the center towards the edges. The weight distribution
follows a Gaussian function, with the variance determined by the target's size.
Consequently, V2P effectively isolates the target area and teaches the model to
concentrate on the most essential point of the UI element. The model trained by
V2P achieves the performance with 92.3% and 50.5% on two benchmarks
ScreenSpot-v2 and ScreenSpot-Pro. Ablations further confirm each component's
contribution, highlighting V2P's generalizability for precise GUI grounding
tasks.

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了在不完整知识图谱中处理包含软约束查询的问题，为更精细化的查询答案提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Methods for query answering over incomplete knowledge graphs retrieve
entities that are likely to be answers, which is particularly useful when such
answers cannot be reached by direct graph traversal due to missing edges.
However, existing approaches have focused on queries formalized using
first-order-logic. In practice, many real-world queries involve constraints
that are inherently vague or context-dependent, such as preferences for
attributes or related categories. Addressing this gap, we introduce the problem
of query answering with soft constraints. We propose a Neural Query Reranker
(NQR) designed to adjust query answer scores by incorporating soft constraints
without disrupting the original answers to a query. NQR operates interactively,
refining answers based on incremental examples of preferred and non-preferred
entities. We extend existing QA benchmarks by generating datasets with soft
constraints. Our experiments demonstrate that NQR can capture soft constraints
while maintaining robust query answering performance.

Conclusion: 通过引入实例迁移学习和真实数据的使用，ITL-LIME有效解决了LIME在数据稀缺情况下的性能限制，为可解释人工智能提供了更可靠的解释方法

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods, such as Local
Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), have advanced the
interpretability of black-box machine learning models by approximating their
behavior locally using interpretable surrogate models. However, LIME's inherent
randomness in perturbation and sampling can lead to locality and instability
issues, especially in scenarios with limited training data. In such cases, data
scarcity can result in the generation of unrealistic variations and samples
that deviate from the true data manifold. Consequently, the surrogate model may
fail to accurately approximate the complex decision boundary of the original
model. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Instance-based Transfer
Learning LIME framework (ITL-LIME) that enhances explanation fidelity and
stability in data-constrained environments. ITL-LIME introduces instance
transfer learning into the LIME framework by leveraging relevant real instances
from a related source domain to aid the explanation process in the target
domain. Specifically, we employ clustering to partition the source domain into
clusters with representative prototypes. Instead of generating random
perturbations, our method retrieves pertinent real source instances from the
source cluster whose prototype is most similar to the target instance. These
are then combined with the target instance's neighboring real instances. To
define a compact locality, we further construct a contrastive learning-based
encoder as a weighting mechanism to assign weights to the instances from the
combined set based on their proximity to the target instance. Finally, these
weighted source and target instances are used to train the surrogate model for
explanation purposes.

third-party resumes and enrich the company's talent pool, it is essential to
conduct duplication detection between the fetched resumes and those already in
the company's talent pool. Such duplication detection is challenging due to the
semantic complexity, structural heterogeneity, and information incompleteness
of resume texts. To this end, we propose MHSNet, an multi-level identity
verification framework that fine-tunes BGE-M3 using contrastive learning. With
the fine-tuned , Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) generates multi-level sparse and
dense representations for resumes, enabling the computation of corresponding
multi-level semantic similarities. Moreover, the state-aware Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) is employed in MHSNet to handle diverse incomplete resumes. Experimental
results verify the effectiveness of MHSNet

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising results across various
tasks, yet their reasoning capabilities remain a fundamental challenge.
Developing AI systems with strong reasoning capabilities is regarded as a
crucial milestone in the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and
has garnered considerable attention from both academia and industry. Various
techniques have been explored to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs,
with neuro-symbolic approaches being a particularly promising way. This paper
comprehensively reviews recent developments in neuro-symbolic approaches for
enhancing LLM reasoning. We first present a formalization of reasoning tasks
and give a brief introduction to the neurosymbolic learning paradigm. Then, we
discuss neuro-symbolic methods for improving the reasoning capabilities of LLMs
from three perspectives: Symbolic->LLM, LLM->Symbolic, and LLM+Symbolic.
Finally, we discuss several key challenges and promising future directions. We
have also released a GitHub repository including papers and resources related
to this survey: https://github.com/LAMDASZ-ML/Awesome-LLM-Reasoning-with-NeSy.

TL;DR: DeepLog是一个神经符号AI的理论和操作框架，提供构建块和原语，通过扩展的代数电路作为计算图，支持多种逻辑类型和实现方式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决神经符号AI中不同表示和计算机制的抽象问题，提供一个统一的框架来支持多种神经符号系统的表示和仿真。

Method: 开发DeepLog语言（基于接地一阶逻辑的神经扩展）和计算级组件（使用扩展代数电路作为计算图），构建神经符号抽象机器。

Result: DeepLog能够表示和仿真广泛的神经符号系统，在GPU上高效实现，支持模糊逻辑、概率逻辑等多种逻辑类型。

Conclusion: DeepLog提供了一个通用且高效的神经符号AI框架，通过实验验证了其在处理不同逻辑类型和硬件平台上的优越性能。

Abstract: We contribute a theoretical and operational framework for neurosymbolic AI
called DeepLog. DeepLog introduces building blocks and primitives for
neurosymbolic AI that make abstraction of commonly used representations and
computational mechanisms used in neurosymbolic AI. DeepLog can represent and
emulate a wide range of neurosymbolic systems. It consists of two key
components. The first is the DeepLog language for specifying neurosymbolic
models and inference tasks. This language consists of an annotated neural
extension of grounded first-order logic, and makes abstraction of the type of
logic, e.g. boolean, fuzzy or probabilistic, and whether logic is used in the
architecture or in the loss function. The second DeepLog component is situated
at the computational level and uses extended algebraic circuits as
computational graphs. Together these two components are to be considered as a
neurosymbolic abstract machine, with the DeepLog language as the intermediate
level of abstraction and the circuits level as the computational one. DeepLog
is implemented in software, relies on the latest insights in implementing
algebraic circuits on GPUs, and is declarative in that it is easy to obtain
different neurosymbolic models by making different choices for the underlying
algebraic structures and logics. The generality and efficiency of the DeepLog
neurosymbolic machine is demonstrated through an experimental comparison
between 1) different fuzzy and probabilistic logics, 2) between using logic in
the architecture or in the loss function, and 3) between a standalone CPU-based
implementation of a neurosymbolic AI system and a DeepLog GPU-based one.

*Minh Hoang Nguyen,Van Dai Do,Dung Nguyen,Thin Nguyen,Hung Le*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CausalPlan是一个两阶段框架，通过将显式结构因果推理集成到LLM规划过程中，解决了小规模开源LLM在协作任务中产生因果无效或不连贯动作的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（尤其是小型开源模型）在协作任务中往往基于表面相关性而非因果推理产生无效动作，这限制了它们在动态环境中的协调和规划能力。

Method: 提出CausalPlan框架，包含结构因果行动（SCA）模型，从智能体轨迹中学习因果图来捕捉先前行动和当前环境状态对未来决策的影响，并用因果评分指导动作选择。

Result: 在Overcooked-AI基准测试中，CausalPlan显著减少了无效动作，在AI-AI和人类-AI设置中都改善了协作性能，优于强化学习基线方法。

Conclusion: 因果驱动规划对于部署高效、可解释和可泛化的多智能体LLM系统具有重要价值，无需对LLM本身进行微调即可实现干预一致的行为约束。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents-especially smaller, open-source
models-often produce causally invalid or incoherent actions in collaborative
tasks due to their reliance on surface-level correlations rather than grounded
causal reasoning. This limitation undermines their performance in terms of
coordination and planning in dynamic environments. We address this challenge
with CausalPlan, a two-phase framework that integrates explicit structural
causal reasoning into the LLM planning process. At the core of CausalPlan is
the Structural Causal Action (SCA) model, which learns a causal graph from
agent trajectories to capture how prior actions and current environment states
influence future decisions. This structure is then used to guide action
selection by assigning causal scores to LLM-generated proposals, reweighting
them accordingly, or falling back to causally grounded alternatives when
needed. By embedding this causal knowledge directly into the decision loop,
CausalPlan constrains planning to intervention-consistent behaviours without
requiring fine-tuning of the LLM itself. We evaluate CausalPlan on the
Overcooked-AI benchmark across five multi-agent coordination tasks and four
LLMs of varying sizes: Gemma-7B, Llama-8B, Qwen-14B, and Llama-70B.
Experimental results show that CausalPlan consistently reduces invalid actions
and improves collaboration in both AI-AI and human-AI settings, outperforming
strong reinforcement learning baselines. Our findings highlight the value of
causality-driven planning for deploying efficient, interpretable, and
generalisable multi-agent LLM systems.

TL;DR: 通过专业知识表和多人工智能协作框架，EMRC框架在医疗决策中显著提升了诊断准确性，超越了现有的单一和多重LLM方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单一大语言模型在医疗决策中存在知识限制和静态训练数据的缺陷，无法健壮整合复杂的临床信息

Method: 使用公开语料库构建LLM专业知识表，根据医学科室类别和查询难度动态选择最优LLM，通过自信度评估和对抗验证进行多代理协作

Result: 在三个公开MDM数据集上超过现有最佳方法，在MMLU-Pro-Health数据集上达到74.45%准确率，比GPT-4-0613提升2.69%

Conclusion: EMRC框架通过专业知识动态选择和多代理协作机制，有效提升了医疗决策系统的准确性和可靠性

Abstract: Medical Decision-Making (MDM) is a complex process requiring substantial
domain-specific expertise to effectively synthesize heterogeneous and
complicated clinical information. While recent advancements in Large Language
Models (LLMs) show promise in supporting MDM, single-LLM approaches are limited
by their parametric knowledge constraints and static training corpora, failing
to robustly integrate the clinical information. To address this challenge, we
propose the Expertise-aware Multi-LLM Recruitment and Collaboration (EMRC)
framework to enhance the accuracy and reliability of MDM systems. It operates
in two stages: (i) expertise-aware agent recruitment and (ii) confidence- and
adversarial-driven multi-agent collaboration. Specifically, in the first stage,
we use a publicly available corpus to construct an LLM expertise table for
capturing expertise-specific strengths of multiple LLMs across medical
department categories and query difficulty levels. This table enables the
subsequent dynamic selection of the optimal LLMs to act as medical expert
agents for each medical query during the inference phase. In the second stage,
we employ selected agents to generate responses with self-assessed confidence
scores, which are then integrated through the confidence fusion and adversarial
validation to improve diagnostic reliability. We evaluate our EMRC framework on
three public MDM datasets, where the results demonstrate that our EMRC
outperforms state-of-the-art single- and multi-LLM methods, achieving superior
diagnostic performance. For instance, on the MMLU-Pro-Health dataset, our EMRC
achieves 74.45% accuracy, representing a 2.69% improvement over the
best-performing closed-source model GPT- 4-0613, which demonstrates the
effectiveness of our expertise-aware agent recruitment strategy and the agent
complementarity in leveraging each LLM's specialized capabilities.

Motivation: 量化公式对SMT求解器构成了重大挑战，现有的多种实例化技术虽然互补，但仍需要更有效的方法来处理这种本质上不可判定的问题。

Method: 将观察到的实例化视为潜在语言的样本，使用概率上下文无关文法来生成类似的新项。方法既模仿历史成功实例化，也通过反转学习到的项概率来探索多样性。

Result: 该方法能够动态学习并综合多种实例化技术的优点，在量词推理中实现了利用和探索的平衡。

Conclusion: 通过概率性语言模型动态学习并生成新实例化，为SMT求解器处理量化公式提供了一种有效的新方法，能够综合现有技术的优点并提高求解效率。

Abstract: Quantified formulas pose a significant challenge for Satisfiability Modulo
Theories (SMT) solvers due to their inherent undecidability. Existing
instantiation techniques, such as e-matching, syntax-guided, model-based,
conflict-based, and enumerative methods, often complement each other. This
paper introduces a novel instantiation approach that dynamically learns from
these techniques during solving. By treating observed instantiations as samples
from a latent language, we use probabilistic context-free grammars to generate
new, similar terms. Our method not only mimics successful past instantiations
but also explores diversity by optionally inverting learned term probabilities,
aiming to balance exploitation and exploration in quantifier reasoning.

Motivation: 当前单一RAG框架无法良好适应广泛的下游任务，需要利用多个RAG系统的优势来提升性能。

Method: 从理论分析角度通过信息熵角度解释RAG集成框架；从机制分析角度研究了管线级别（Branching、Iterative、Loop、Agentic）和模块级别（Generator、Retriever、Reranker）的集成方法。

Result: 实验结果显示，无论在管线级别还是模块级别，聚合多个RAG系统都具有良好的普适性和稳健性。

Conclusion: 本研究为多RAG系统集成相关研究奠定了基础，提供了理论支撑和实践方法。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology has been widely applied in
recent years. However, despite the emergence of various RAG frameworks, a
single RAG framework still cannot adapt well to a broad range of downstream
tasks. Therefore, how to leverage the advantages of multiple RAG systems has
become an area worth exploring. To address this issue, we have conducted a
comprehensive and systematic investigation into ensemble methods based on RAG
systems. Specifically, we have analyzed the RAG ensemble framework from both
theoretical and mechanistic analysis perspectives. From the theoretical
analysis, we provide the first explanation of the RAG ensemble framework from
the perspective of information entropy. In terms of mechanism analysis, we have
explored the RAG ensemble framework from both the pipeline and module levels.
We carefully select four different pipelines (Branching, Iterative, Loop, and
Agentic) and three different modules (Generator, Retriever, and Reranker) to
solve seven different research questions. The experiments show that aggregating
multiple RAG systems is both generalizable and robust, whether at the pipeline
level or the module level. Our work lays the foundation for similar research on
the multi-RAG system ensemble.

Conclusion: 通过伪代码调试、反思步骤和多版本选择的综合方法，可以有效提高LLM生成广义规划的准确性和可靠性

Abstract: LLMs have recently been used to generate Python programs representing
generalized plans in PDDL planning, i.e., plans that generalize across the
tasks of a given PDDL domain. Previous work proposed a framework consisting of
three steps: the LLM first generates a summary and then a strategy for the
domain, both in natural language, and then implements that strategy as a Python
program, that gets debugged on example planning tasks. In that work, only one
strategy is generated and passed directly to the program generation. If the
strategy is incorrect, its implementation will therefore result in an incorrect
generalized plan. Here, we introduce an approach that generates the strategy in
the form of pseudocode and enables automatic debugging of the pseudocode, hence
allowing us to identify and fix errors prior to the generation of the
generalized plan itself. Additionally, we extend the Python debugging phase
with a reflection step prompting the LLM to pinpoint the reason for the
observed plan failure. Finally, we take inspiration from LLM code generation to
produce several program variants and pick the best one. Running experiments on
17 benchmark domains, we show that these extensions substantially improve (and
never deteriorate) the quality of the generalized plans. In 12 of the domains,
our best Python programs solve all tasks that can be generated with the
respective instance generator.

Motivation: 金融市场时间序列数据分析需要高性能、可解释且可审计的模型，但现有AutoML框架缺乏对领域特定需求和动态目标的适应性，而LLM代理系统提供了更灵活的工作流自动化路径。

Method: 设计模块化代理框架，包含规划代理和结构化知识库，通过三阶段迭代决策过程（模型选择、代码优化、微调），结合上下文推理和实验反馈来指导探索。

Result: 在多种金融预测和合成数据生成任务上的实证评估表明，TS-Agent在准确性、鲁棒性和决策可追溯性方面持续优于最先进的AutoML和代理基线方法。

Conclusion: TS-Agent框架支持自适应学习、鲁棒调试和透明审计，满足了金融服务等高风险环境的关键需求，为时间序列建模提供了更有效的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Time-series data is central to decision-making in financial markets, yet
building high-performing, interpretable, and auditable models remains a major
challenge. While Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) frameworks streamline
model development, they often lack adaptability and responsiveness to
domain-specific needs and evolving objectives. Concurrently, Large Language
Models (LLMs) have enabled agentic systems capable of reasoning, memory
management, and dynamic code generation, offering a path toward more flexible
workflow automation. In this paper, we introduce \textsf{TS-Agent}, a modular
agentic framework designed to automate and enhance time-series modeling
workflows for financial applications. The agent formalizes the pipeline as a
structured, iterative decision process across three stages: model selection,
code refinement, and fine-tuning, guided by contextual reasoning and
experimental feedback. Central to our architecture is a planner agent equipped
with structured knowledge banks, curated libraries of models and refinement
strategies, which guide exploration, while improving interpretability and
reducing error propagation. \textsf{TS-Agent} supports adaptive learning,
robust debugging, and transparent auditing, key requirements for high-stakes
environments such as financial services. Empirical evaluations on diverse
financial forecasting and synthetic data generation tasks demonstrate that
\textsf{TS-Agent} consistently outperforms state-of-the-art AutoML and agentic
baselines, achieving superior accuracy, robustness, and decision traceability.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了协作AI代理的新兴行为特征，为设计稳定有效的AI驱动商业分析系统提供了重要蓝图和见解。

Abstract: The rise of autonomous, AI-driven agents in economic settings raises critical
questions about their emergent strategic behavior. This paper investigates
these dynamics in the cooperative context of a multi-echelon supply chain, a
system famously prone to instabilities like the bullwhip effect. We conduct
computational experiments with generative AI agents, powered by Large Language
Models (LLMs), within a controlled supply chain simulation designed to isolate
their behavioral tendencies. Our central finding is the "collaboration
paradox": a novel, catastrophic failure mode where theoretically superior
collaborative AI agents, designed with Vendor-Managed Inventory (VMI)
principles, perform even worse than non-AI baselines. We demonstrate that this
paradox arises from an operational flaw where agents hoard inventory, starving
the system. We then show that resilience is only achieved through a synthesis
of two distinct layers: high-level, AI-driven proactive policy-setting to
establish robust operational targets, and a low-level, collaborative execution
protocol with proactive downstream replenishment to maintain stability. Our
final framework, which implements this synthesis, can autonomously generate,
evaluate, and quantify a portfolio of viable strategic choices. The work
provides a crucial insight into the emergent behaviors of collaborative AI
agents and offers a blueprint for designing stable, effective AI-driven systems
for business analytics.

Abstract: This contribution is concerned with the following issue: can pretrained large
language models (LLMs) be refined and customized to the point where they become
virtual assistants helping experts with the effective use of a simulation tool?
In this case study, the ``simulation tool'' considered is PyChrono, an open
source multi-physics dynamics engine for multibody systems. We present a
framework for refining and customizing both open- and closed-source LLMs to
harness the power of AI in generating scripts that perform PyChrono virtual
experiments. We refine and customize several classes of LLMs through a process
that leads to a quantifiable improvement in the quality of the generated
PyChrono simulation scripts. These scripts can range from simple
single-pendulum simulations to complex virtual experiments involving full
vehicles on deformable terrain. While the generated scripts are rarely perfect,
they often serve as strong starting points for the user to modify and improve
on. Additionally, the LLM can answer specific API questions about the
simulator, or recommend modeling approaches. The framework discussed is general
and can be applied to lower the entry barrier for simulation tools associated
with other application domains.

Abstract: The longest run subsequence (LRS) problem is an NP-hard combinatorial
optimization problem belonging to the class of subsequence problems from
bioinformatics. In particular, the problem plays a role in genome reassembly.
In this paper, we present a solution to the LRS problem using a Biased Random

computational efficiency of evaluating individuals, which involves converting
vectors of gray values into valid solutions to the problem. For comparison
purposes, a Max-Min Ant System is developed and implemented. This is in
addition to the application of the integer linear programming solver CPLEX for
solving all considered problem instances. The computation results show that the
proposed BRKGA is currently a state-of-the-art technique for the LRS problem.
Nevertheless, the results also show that there is room for improvement,
especially in the context of input strings based on large alphabet sizes.

Abstract: We introduce ComputerRL, a framework for autonomous desktop intelligence that
enables agents to operate complex digital workspaces skillfully. ComputerRL
features the API-GUI paradigm, which unifies programmatic API calls and direct
GUI interaction to address the inherent mismatch between machine agents and
human-centric desktop environments. Scaling end-to-end RL training is crucial
for improvement and generalization across diverse desktop tasks, yet remains
challenging due to environmental inefficiency and instability in extended
training. To support scalable and robust training, we develop a distributed RL
infrastructure capable of orchestrating thousands of parallel virtual desktop
environments to accelerate large-scale online RL. Furthermore, we propose
Entropulse, a training strategy that alternates reinforcement learning with
supervised fine-tuning, effectively mitigating entropy collapse during extended
training runs. We employ ComputerRL on open models GLM-4-9B-0414 and
Qwen2.5-14B, and evaluate them on the OSWorld benchmark. The AutoGLM-OS-9B
based on GLM-4-9B-0414 achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 48.1%,
demonstrating significant improvements for general agents in desktop

Abstract: This paper proposes PreSem-Surf, an optimized method based on the Neural
Radiance Field (NeRF) framework, capable of reconstructing high-quality scene

depth, and semantic information to improve reconstruction performance.
Specifically, a novel SG-MLP sampling structure combined with PR-MLP

allowing the model to capture scene-related information earlier and better
distinguish noise from local details. Furthermore, progressive semantic
modeling is adopted to extract semantic information at increasing levels of
precision, reducing training time while enhancing scene understanding.
Experiments on seven synthetic scenes with six evaluation metrics show that

Abstract: We present a multi-level elastodynamics timestep solver for accelerating
incremental potential contact (IPC) simulations. Our method retains the
robustness of gold standard IPC in the face of intricate geometry, complex
heterogeneous material distributions and high resolution input data without
sacrificing visual fidelity (per-timestep relative displacement error of
$\approx1\%$). The success of our method is enabled by a novel, sparse,
geometry- and material-aware basis construction method which allows for the use
of fast preconditioned conjugate gradient solvers (in place of a sparse direct
solver), but without suffering convergence issues due to stiff or heterogeneous
materials. The end result is a solver that produces results visually
indistinguishable and quantitatively very close to gold-standard IPC methods
but up to $13\times$ faster on identical hardware.

Abstract: The boundary-constrained floor plan generation problem aims to generate the
topological and geometric properties of a set of rooms within a given boundary.
Recently, learning-based methods have made significant progress in generating
realistic floor plans. However, these methods involve a workflow of converting
vector data into raster images, using image-based generative models, and then
converting the results back into vector data. This process is complex and
redundant, often resulting in information loss. Raster images, unlike vector
data, cannot scale without losing detail and precision. To address these
issues, we propose a novel deep learning framework called DiffPlanner for
boundary-constrained floor plan generation, which operates entirely in vector
space. Our framework is a Transformer-based conditional diffusion model that
integrates an alignment mechanism in training, aligning the optimization
trajectory of the model with the iterative design processes of designers. This
enables our model to handle complex vector data, better fit the distribution of
the predicted targets, accomplish the challenging task of floor plan layout
design, and achieve user-controllable generation. We conduct quantitative
comparisons, qualitative evaluations, ablation experiments, and perceptual
studies to evaluate our method. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
DiffPlanner surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in generating floor
plans and bubble diagrams in the creative stages, offering more controllability
to users and producing higher-quality results that closely match the ground
truths.

Abstract: Recent video editing methods achieve attractive results in style transfer or
appearance modification. However, editing the structural content of 3D scenes
in videos remains challenging, particularly when dealing with significant
viewpoint changes, such as large camera rotations or zooms. Key challenges
include generating novel view content that remains consistent with the original
video, preserving unedited regions, and translating sparse 2D inputs into
realistic 3D video outputs. To address these issues, we propose Sketch3DVE, a
sketch-based 3D-aware video editing method to enable detailed local
manipulation of videos with significant viewpoint changes. To solve the
challenge posed by sparse inputs, we employ image editing methods to generate
edited results for the first frame, which are then propagated to the remaining
frames of the video. We utilize sketching as an interaction tool for precise
geometry control, while other mask-based image editing methods are also
supported. To handle viewpoint changes, we perform a detailed analysis and
manipulation of the 3D information in the video. Specifically, we utilize a
dense stereo method to estimate a point cloud and the camera parameters of the
input video. We then propose a point cloud editing approach that uses depth
maps to represent the 3D geometry of newly edited components, aligning them
effectively with the original 3D scene. To seamlessly merge the newly edited
content with the original video while preserving the features of unedited
regions, we introduce a 3D-aware mask propagation strategy and employ a video
diffusion model to produce realistic edited videos. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority of Sketch3DVE in video editing. Homepage and code:

Conclusion: Is-NeRF通过显式光路建模和散射感知渲染，有效解决了传统NeRF在处理模糊图像时的限制，为复杂光路场景的高保真恢复提供了有效方案

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has gained significant attention for its
prominent implicit 3D representation and realistic novel view synthesis
capabilities. Available works unexceptionally employ straight-line volume
rendering, which struggles to handle sophisticated lightpath scenarios and
introduces geometric ambiguities during training, particularly evident when
processing motion-blurred images. To address these challenges, this work
proposes a novel deblur neural radiance field, Is-NeRF, featuring explicit
lightpath modeling in real-world environments. By unifying six common light
propagation phenomena through an in-scattering representation, we establish a
new scattering-aware volume rendering pipeline adaptable to complex lightpaths.
Additionally, we introduce an adaptive learning strategy that enables
autonomous determining of scattering directions and sampling intervals to
capture finer object details. The proposed network jointly optimizes NeRF
parameters, scattering parameters, and camera motions to recover fine-grained
scene representations from blurry images. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate
that it effectively handles complex real-world scenarios, outperforming
state-of-the-art approaches in generating high-fidelity images with accurate
geometric details.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种不确定性感知学习策略，通过同时学习医生的背景知识和肺部病变信息，提高医疗AI在胸部X光片诊断中的准确性和可信质。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗AI虽然发展快速，但医生对其不确定性的担忧导致了临床应用的限制。这主要来自医疗AI仅依靠重复学习病变信息，缺乏医生所拥有的丰富背景知识和临床经验。

Method: 研究提出了不确定性感知学习策略，同时学习医生的背景知识和肺部病变信息。使用了来自Ajou大学医院的2,517张无病变图像和656张结节图像进行训练。

Result: 提出模型达到92%的性能（IoU 0.2 / FPPI 2），敏感度比基线模型提高10%，并将作为不确定性指标的熵提降低了0.2。

Conclusion: 该研究通过学习医生的背景知识有效地减少了医疗AI的诊断不确定性，为提高医生对AI系统的信任和普及临床应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Early detection and rapid intervention of lung cancer are crucial.
Nonetheless, ensuring an accurate diagnosis is challenging, as physicians'
ability to interpret chest X-rays varies significantly depending on their
experience and degree of fatigue. Although medical AI has been rapidly
advancing to assist in diagnosis, physicians' trust in such systems remains
limited, preventing widespread clinical adoption. This skepticism fundamentally
stems from concerns about its diagnostic uncertainty. In clinical diagnosis,
physicians utilize extensive background knowledge and clinical experience. In
contrast, medical AI primarily relies on repetitive learning of the target
lesion to generate diagnoses based solely on that data. In other words, medical
AI does not possess sufficient knowledge to render a diagnosis, leading to
diagnostic uncertainty. Thus, this study suggests an Uncertainty-Aware Learning
Policy that can address the issue of knowledge deficiency by learning the
physicians' background knowledge alongside the Chest X-ray lesion information.
We used 2,517 lesion-free images and 656 nodule images, all obtained from Ajou
University Hospital. The proposed model attained 92% (IoU 0.2 / FPPI 2) with a
10% enhancement in sensitivity compared to the baseline model while also
decreasing entropy as a measure of uncertainty by 0.2.
