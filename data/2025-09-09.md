### [1] [Label Smoothing++: Enhanced Label Regularization for Training Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05307)
*Sachin Chhabra,Hemanth Venkateswara,Baoxin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Label Smoothing++是一种改进的标签正则化方法，通过为非目标类别分配非零概率并考虑类别间关系，解决了传统标签平滑破坏类别关系的缺点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统标签平滑虽然能改善神经网络泛化能力，但为所有非目标类别分配相同概率，破坏了类别间的语义关系。需要一种能保持类别关系同时防止过拟合的方法。

Method: 提出Label Smoothing++策略，为目标类别使用固定标签，同时让网络学习非目标类别的标签，为非目标类别分配非零概率并考虑其相互关系。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，该方法能有效缓解过自信预测，同时促进类别间关系和泛化能力。

Conclusion: Label Smoothing++通过更好地建模类别间关系，在保持标签平滑优势的同时解决了其局限性，提高了模型的泛化性能。

Abstract: Training neural networks with one-hot target labels often results in
overconfidence and overfitting. Label smoothing addresses this issue by
perturbing the one-hot target labels by adding a uniform probability vector to
create a regularized label. Although label smoothing improves the network's
generalization ability, it assigns equal importance to all the non-target
classes, which destroys the inter-class relationships. In this paper, we
propose a novel label regularization training strategy called Label
Smoothing++, which assigns non-zero probabilities to non-target classes and
accounts for their inter-class relationships. Our approach uses a fixed label
for the target class while enabling the network to learn the labels associated
with non-target classes. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, we
demonstrate how Label Smoothing++ mitigates overconfident predictions while
promoting inter-class relationships and generalization capabilities.

### [2] [VILOD: A Visual Interactive Labeling Tool for Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05317)
*Isac Holm*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VILOD是一个可视化交互标注工具，通过t-SNE投影、不确定性热图和模型状态视图，使目标检测中的人机协作标注更加透明和高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标检测深度学习需要大量标注数据，但传统主动学习方法缺乏透明度，限制了人类专家的战略洞察，可能错过重要样本。

Method: 开发VILOD工具，集成t-SNE图像特征投影、不确定性热图和模型状态可视化，支持用户在交互式人机循环工作流中探索数据和实施多样本选择策略。

Result: 实证研究表明VILOD使模型状态和数据集特征更易解释，不同可视化引导标注策略相比自动化不确定性采样基线获得了有竞争力的目标检测性能轨迹。

Conclusion: 该工作为OD标注的人机循环主动学习工作流提供了新颖工具和实证见解，使其更加透明、可管理且可能更有效。

Abstract: The advancement of Object Detection (OD) using Deep Learning (DL) is often
hindered by the significant challenge of acquiring large, accurately labeled
datasets, a process that is time-consuming and expensive. While techniques like
Active Learning (AL) can reduce annotation effort by intelligently querying
informative samples, they often lack transparency, limit the strategic insight
of human experts, and may overlook informative samples not aligned with an
employed query strategy. To mitigate these issues, Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)
approaches integrating human intelligence and intuition throughout the machine
learning life-cycle have gained traction. Leveraging Visual Analytics (VA),
effective interfaces can be created to facilitate this human-AI collaboration.
This thesis explores the intersection of these fields by developing and
investigating "VILOD: A Visual Interactive Labeling tool for Object Detection".
VILOD utilizes components such as a t-SNE projection of image features,
together with uncertainty heatmaps and model state views. Enabling users to
explore data, interpret model states, AL suggestions, and implement diverse
sample selection strategies within an iterative HITL workflow for OD. An
empirical investigation using comparative use cases demonstrated how VILOD,
through its interactive visualizations, facilitates the implementation of
distinct labeling strategies by making the model's state and dataset
characteristics more interpretable (RQ1). The study showed that different
visually-guided labeling strategies employed within VILOD result in competitive
OD performance trajectories compared to an automated uncertainty sampling AL
baseline (RQ2). This work contributes a novel tool and empirical insight into
making the HITL-AL workflow for OD annotation more transparent, manageable, and
potentially more effective.

### [3] [Context-Aware Knowledge Distillation with Adaptive Weighting for Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05319)
*Zhengda Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出自适应知识蒸馏(AKD)框架，通过动态调整硬标签和软标签损失的平衡因子alpha，使用学生-教师差异和上下文感知模块来提升蒸馏效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识蒸馏使用固定的alpha超参数来平衡硬标签和软标签损失，但静态alpha在训练过程中不是最优的，因为硬监督和软监督之间的最优权衡会随时间变化。

Method: 1) 将alpha作为可学习参数自动优化；2) 基于学生-教师差异动态计算alpha；3) 引入上下文感知模块(CAM)，使用MLP+Attention自适应重新加权教师输出的类别权重。

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上，使用ResNet-50作为教师、ResNet-18作为学生的实验表明，该方法相比固定权重KD基线获得了更高的准确率，并实现了更稳定的收敛。

Conclusion: 自适应知识蒸馏框架通过动态调整损失权重和引入上下文感知机制，有效提升了知识蒸馏的性能和训练稳定性。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a widely used technique to transfer knowledge
from a large teacher network to a smaller student model. Traditional KD uses a
fixed balancing factor alpha as a hyperparameter to combine the hard-label
cross-entropy loss with the soft-label distillation loss. However, a static
alpha is suboptimal because the optimal trade-off between hard and soft
supervision can vary during training.
  In this work, we propose an Adaptive Knowledge Distillation (AKD) framework.
First we try to make alpha as learnable parameter that can be automatically
learned and optimized during training. Then we introduce a formula to reflect
the gap between the student and the teacher to compute alpha dynamically,
guided by student-teacher discrepancies, and further introduce a Context-Aware
Module (CAM) using MLP + Attention to adaptively reweight class-wise teacher
outputs. Experiments on CIFAR-10 with ResNet-50 as teacher and ResNet-18 as
student demonstrate that our approach achieves superior accuracy compared to
fixed-weight KD baselines, and yields more stable convergence.

analysis, data augmentation, and brain-computer interface applications, with
substantial research and engineering significance.

### [5] [Application of discrete Ricci curvature in pruning randomly wired neural networks: A case study with chest x-ray classification of COVID-19](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05322)
*Pavithra Elumalai,Sudharsan Vijayaraghavan,Madhumita Mondal,Areejit Samal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究比较了三种边中心网络度量（FRC、ORC、EBC）在随机有线神经网络剪枝中的效果，发现计算效率更高的FRC能达到与ORC相当的剪枝性能，同时显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索网络拓扑结构对深度学习性能的影响，寻找计算效率更高的网络剪枝方法，特别是在COVID-19胸部X光图像分类任务中减少网络复杂度同时保持性能。

Method: 使用三种边中心网络度量（Forman-Ricci曲率、Ollivier-Ricci曲率、边介数中心性）对三种随机网络生成器（ER、WS、BA模型）生成的RWNN进行选择性剪枝，保留重要突触。

Result: FRC基于剪枝能有效简化RWNN，提供显著计算优势，同时保持与ORC相当的性能表现。通过模块性和全局效率分析揭示了压缩网络中模块化分离与网络效率之间的权衡关系。

Conclusion: 计算效率更高的FRC可以作为ORC的有效替代方案进行网络剪枝，为深度学习网络的优化压缩提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Randomly Wired Neural Networks (RWNNs) serve as a valuable testbed for
investigating the impact of network topology in deep learning by capturing how
different connectivity patterns impact both learning efficiency and model
performance. At the same time, they provide a natural framework for exploring
edge-centric network measures as tools for pruning and optimization. In this
study, we investigate three edge-centric network measures: Forman-Ricci
curvature (FRC), Ollivier-Ricci curvature (ORC), and edge betweenness
centrality (EBC), to compress RWNNs by selectively retaining important synapses
(or edges) while pruning the rest. As a baseline, RWNNs are trained for
COVID-19 chest x-ray image classification, aiming to reduce network complexity
while preserving performance in terms of accuracy, specificity, and
sensitivity. We extend prior work on pruning RWNN using ORC by incorporating
two additional edge-centric measures, FRC and EBC, across three network
generators: Erd\"{o}s-R\'{e}nyi (ER) model, Watts-Strogatz (WS) model, and
Barab\'{a}si-Albert (BA) model. We provide a comparative analysis of the
pruning performance of the three measures in terms of compression ratio and
theoretical speedup. A central focus of our study is to evaluate whether FRC,
which is computationally more efficient than ORC, can achieve comparable
pruning effectiveness. Along with performance evaluation, we further
investigate the structural properties of the pruned networks through modularity
and global efficiency, offering insights into the trade-off between modular
segregation and network efficiency in compressed RWNNs. Our results provide
initial evidence that FRC-based pruning can effectively simplify RWNNs,
offering significant computational advantages while maintaining performance
comparable to ORC.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of Optical Music Recognition (OMR)
for handwritten jazz lead sheets, a widely used musical score type that encodes
melody and chords. The task is challenging due to the presence of chords, a
score component not handled by existing OMR systems, and the high variability
and quality issues associated with handwritten images. Our contribution is
two-fold. We present a novel dataset consisting of 293 handwritten jazz lead
sheets of 163 unique pieces, amounting to 2021 total staves aligned with
Humdrum **kern and MusicXML ground truth scores. We also supply synthetic score
images generated from the ground truth. The second contribution is the
development of an OMR model for jazz lead sheets. We discuss specific
tokenisation choices related to our kind of data, and the advantages of using
synthetic scores and pretrained models. We publicly release all code, data, and
models.

### [7] [RT-VLM: Re-Thinking Vision Language Model with 4-Clues for Real-World Object Recognition Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05333)
*Junghyun Park,Tuan Anh Nguyen,Dugki Min*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RT-VLM框架通过合成数据集生成和两阶段重新思考机制，有效应对目标识别模型在域偏移下的性能下降问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界部署中，目标识别模型面临多种域偏移（图像统计变化、姿态变化、遮挡、类间混淆）导致准确率严重下降，需要开发更鲁棒的视觉理解方法

Method: 1) 构建合成数据集生成管道，生成包含4个线索（边界框、类名、目标级描述、场景级描述）的图像标注；2) 对Llama 3.2 11B Vision Instruct进行参数高效监督调优；3) 推理时执行两阶段重新思考：先输出四个线索，再将其作为证据进行迭代修正

Result: 在隔离单个域偏移的鲁棒性基准测试中，RT-VLM始终超越强基线模型

Conclusion: 结构化多模态证据与显式自批判循环的结合是实现可靠且可迁移视觉理解的有前途路径

Abstract: Real world deployments often expose modern object recognition models to
domain shifts that precipitate a severe drop in accuracy. Such shifts encompass
(i) variations in low level image statistics, (ii) changes in object pose and
viewpoint, (iii) partial occlusion, and (iv) visual confusion across adjacent
classes. To mitigate this degradation, we introduce the Re-Thinking Vision
Language Model (RT-VLM) framework. The foundation of this framework is a unique
synthetic dataset generation pipeline that produces images annotated with
"4-Clues": precise bounding boxes, class names, detailed object-level captions,
and a comprehensive context-level caption for the entire scene. We then perform
parameter efficient supervised tuning of Llama 3.2 11B Vision Instruct on this
resource. At inference time, a two stage Re-Thinking scheme is executed: the
model first emits its own four clues, then re examines these responses as
evidence and iteratively corrects them. Across robustness benchmarks that
isolate individual domain shifts, RT-VLM consistently surpasses strong
baselines. These findings indicate that the integration of structured
multimodal evidence with an explicit self critique loop constitutes a promising
route toward reliable and transferable visual understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统运动性能测量技术质明、复杂且费用高的问题，让业余和娱乐玩家也能享受高级性能分析服务

Method: 采用自定制YOLOv5模型进行羽毛球检测，结合Kalman滤波实现稳健轨迹跟踪，通过视频基于动力学速度估计方法进行时空缩放

Result: 开发出了一个直观易用的移动应用程序，能够自动计算羽毛球速度，为各级别玩家提供性能分析

Conclusion: 该系统成功平台化了高级运动性能分析技术，使得普通玩家也能便捷地获得专业级别的训练反馈

Abstract: Performance metrics in sports, such as shot speed and angle, provide crucial
feedback for athlete development. However, the technology to capture these
metrics has historically been expensive, complex, and largely inaccessible to
amateur and recreational players. This paper addresses this gap in the context
of badminton, one of the world's most popular sports, by introducing a novel,
cost-effective, and user-friendly system for measuring smash speed using
ubiquitous smartphone technology. Our approach leverages a custom-trained
YOLOv5 model for shuttlecock detection, combined with a Kalman filter for
robust trajectory tracking. By implementing a video-based kinematic speed
estimation method with spatiotemporal scaling, the system automatically
calculates the shuttlecock's velocity from a standard video recording. The
entire process is packaged into an intuitive mobile application, democratizing
access to high-level performance analytics and empowering players at all levels
to analyze and improve their game.

### [9] [A Stroke-Level Large-Scale Database of Chinese Character Handwriting and the OpenHandWrite_Toolbox for Handwriting Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05335)
*Zebo Xu,Shaoyun Yu,Mark Torrance,Guido Nottbusch,Nan Zhao,Zhenguang Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文构建了个大规模中文手写数据库和开放手写工具箱，通过多重回归分析发现词形、语音等语言因素在字符、部首和笔画层次对手写准备和执行有层级衰减的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决中文手写研究中语言组件（语音、语义、词形）在不同层次的调控机制不清、以及缺乏细粒度手写数据捕获和批量处理工具的问题。

Method: 构建大规模手写数据库（42名受试者手写1200个汉字），升级开放手写工具箱OpenHandWrite_Toolbox，支持实验设计修改、笔躍轨迹捕获和批量处理，并使用多重回归分析语言因素影响。

Result: 词形预测因子在字符、部首和笔画层次都影响手写准备和执行；语音因素在所有三个层次都影响执行。这些词汇效应呈现层级衰减特征：字符层最明显，部首层次之，笔画层最弱。

Conclusion: 手写准备和执行在部首和笔画层次与语言组件密切相关，该数据库和工具箱为语言心理学和语言神经学研究提供了价值较高的资源。

Abstract: Understanding what linguistic components (e.g., phonological, semantic, and
orthographic systems) modulate Chinese handwriting at the character, radical,
and stroke levels remains an important yet understudied topic. Additionally,
there is a lack of comprehensive tools for capturing and batch-processing
fine-grained handwriting data. To address these issues, we constructed a
large-scale handwriting database in which 42 Chinese speakers for each
handwriting 1200 characters in a handwriting-to-dictation task. Additionally,
we enhanced the existing handwriting package and provided comprehensive
documentation for the upgraded OpenHandWrite_Toolbox, which can easily modify
the experimental design, capture the stroke-level handwriting trajectory, and
batch-process handwriting measurements (e.g., latency, duration, and
pen-pressure). In analysing our large-scale database, multiple regression
results show that orthographic predictors impact handwriting preparation and
execution across character, radical, and stroke levels. Phonological factors
also influence execution at all three levels. Importantly, these lexical
effects demonstrate hierarchical attenuation - they were most pronounced at the
character level, followed by the radical, and were weakest at the stroke
levels. These findings demonstrate that handwriting preparation and execution
at the radical and stroke levels are closely intertwined with linguistic
components. This database and toolbox offer valuable resources for future
psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic research on the handwriting of characters
and sub-characters across different languages.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合动态图神经网络和LSTM的混合模型，用于预测跌倒事件，通过解耦运动预测和步态分类任务实现高精度早期跌倒检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注跌倒检测，但跌倒发生前的预测以及稳定状态与即将跌倒之间的瞬态状态分析尚未得到充分探索，这对于辅助机器人系统至关重要。

Method: 使用混合模型：DGNN作为分类器区分稳定、瞬态和跌倒三种步态状态，LSTM网络预测后续时间步的人类运动。从视频序列中提取实时骨骼特征作为输入。

Result: 在OUMVLP-Pose和URFD数据集上验证，相比仅使用DGNN的模型和文献中的模型，在预测误差和识别准确率方面表现出优越性能。解耦预测和分类比统一处理方法效果更好。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅能提前检测跌倒，还能监测瞬态状态，为高级辅助系统提供有价值的见解，有望增强其功能。

Abstract: Detecting and preventing falls in humans is a critical component of assistive
robotic systems. While significant progress has been made in detecting falls,
the prediction of falls before they happen, and analysis of the transient state
between stability and an impending fall remain unexplored. In this paper, we
propose a anticipatory fall detection method that utilizes a hybrid model
combining Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (DGNN) with Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) networks that decoupled the motion prediction and gait classification
tasks to anticipate falls with high accuracy. Our approach employs real-time
skeletal features extracted from video sequences as input for the proposed
model. The DGNN acts as a classifier, distinguishing between three gait states:
stable, transient, and fall. The LSTM-based network then predicts human
movement in subsequent time steps, enabling early detection of falls. The
proposed model was trained and validated using the OUMVLP-Pose and URFD
datasets, demonstrating superior performance in terms of prediction error and
recognition accuracy compared to models relying solely on DGNN and models from
literature. The results indicate that decoupling prediction and classification
improves performance compared to addressing the unified problem using only the
DGNN. Furthermore, our method allows for the monitoring of the transient state,
offering valuable insights that could enhance the functionality of advanced
assistance systems.

### [11] [Comparative Evaluation of Hard and Soft Clustering for Precise Brain Tumor Segmentation in MR Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05340)
*Dibya Jyoti Bora,Mrinal Kanti Mishra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文对比分析了K-Means硬聚类和Fuzzy C-Means软聚类在MRI脑罐分割中的性能。K-Means运行更快（0.3s/弹），但FCM分割精度更高（DSC 0.67 vs 0.43），但计算成本更高（1.3s/弹）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精确分割脑罐对临床决策、放疗规划和疾病监测至关重要。由于脑罐的异质性和强度分布复杂，需要寻找有效的分割方法。

Method: 使用BraTS2020数据集，通过高斯滤波和CLAHE进行预处理。对比K-Means（硬聚类）和FCM（软聚类）两种聚类方法的性能。

Result: K-Means平均运行时间0.3秒，DSC指标0.43；FCM运行时间1.3秒，DSC指标0.67。FCM分割精度更高，但计算成本更大。

Conclusion: 硬聚类和软聚类在计算效率和边界精确度之间存在明显的担杀。K-Means适用于需要高速处理的场景，而FCM适用于需要高精度分割的情况。

Abstract: Segmentation of brain tumors from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remains a
pivotal challenge in medical image analysis due to the heterogeneous nature of
tumor morphology and intensity distributions. Accurate delineation of tumor
boundaries is critical for clinical decision-making, radiotherapy planning, and
longitudinal disease monitoring. In this study, we perform a comprehensive
comparative analysis of two major clustering paradigms applied in MRI tumor
segmentation: hard clustering, exemplified by the K-Means algorithm, and soft
clustering, represented by Fuzzy C-Means (FCM). While K-Means assigns each
pixel strictly to a single cluster, FCM introduces partial memberships, meaning
each pixel can belong to multiple clusters with varying degrees of association.
Experimental validation was performed using the BraTS2020 dataset,
incorporating pre-processing through Gaussian filtering and Contrast Limited
Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE). Evaluation metrics included the Dice
Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and processing time, which collectively
demonstrated that K-Means achieved superior speed with an average runtime of
0.3s per image, whereas FCM attained higher segmentation accuracy with an
average DSC of 0.67 compared to 0.43 for K-Means, albeit at a higher
computational cost (1.3s per image). These results highlight the inherent
trade-off between computational efficiency and boundary precision.

Conclusion: 该模型能够有效地进行多类别葵花病虫害识别，为精准农业提供了可靠的技术支撑

Abstract: Accurate classification of pests and diseases plays a vital role in precision
agriculture, enabling efficient identification, targeted interventions, and
preventing their further spread. However, current methods primarily focus on
binary classification, which limits their practical applications, especially in
scenarios where accurately identifying the specific type of disease or pest is
essential. We propose a robust deep learning based model for multi-class
classification of onion crop diseases and pests. We enhance a pre-trained
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model by integrating attention based modules
and employing comprehensive data augmentation pipeline to mitigate class
imbalance. We propose a model which gives 96.90% overall accuracy and 0.96 F1
score on real-world field image dataset. This model gives better results than
other approaches using the same datasets.

*Gaspard Beaudouin,Minghan Li,Jaeyeon Kim,Sunghoon Yoon,Mengyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DVRF是一种基于蒸馏的无反演图像编辑框架，通过显式建模源和目标速度场差异来减少过平滑伪影，并引入时间相关偏移项来增强目标分布对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有蒸馏采样方法中普遍存在的过平滑伪影问题，提升文本到图像编辑的质量和保真度。

Method: 提出Delta Velocity Rectified Flow (DVRF)框架，通过显式建模源-目标速度场差异和使用时间相关偏移项来优化编辑过程。

Result: 实验结果表明DVRF在编辑质量、保真度和可控性方面表现优异，且无需架构修改，具有高效性和广泛适用性。

Conclusion: DVRF成功弥合了基于分数的扩散优化和基于速度的整流流优化，为FlowEdit等方法提供了理论解释，是文本到图像编辑的有效解决方案。

Abstract: We propose Delta Velocity Rectified Flow (DVRF), a novel inversion-free,
path-aware editing framework within rectified flow models for text-to-image
editing. DVRF is a distillation-based method that explicitly models the
discrepancy between the source and target velocity fields in order to mitigate
over-smoothing artifacts rampant in prior distillation sampling approaches. We
further introduce a time-dependent shift term to push noisy latents closer to
the target trajectory, enhancing the alignment with the target distribution. We
theoretically demonstrate that when this shift is disabled, DVRF reduces to
Delta Denoising Score, thereby bridging score-based diffusion optimization and
velocity-based rectified-flow optimization. Moreover, when the shift term
follows a linear schedule under rectified-flow dynamics, DVRF generalizes the
Inversion-free method FlowEdit and provides a principled theoretical
interpretation for it. Experimental results indicate that DVRF achieves
superior editing quality, fidelity, and controllability while requiring no
architectural modifications, making it efficient and broadly applicable to
text-to-image editing tasks. Code is available at

Abstract: Deep learning has become a powerful tool for medical image analysis; however,
conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) often fail to capture the
fine-grained and complex features critical for accurate diagnosis. To address
this limitation, we systematically integrate attention mechanisms into five
widely adopted CNN architectures, namely, VGG16, ResNet18, InceptionV3,
DenseNet121, and EfficientNetB5, to enhance their ability to focus on salient
regions and improve discriminative performance. Specifically, each baseline
model is augmented with either a Squeeze and Excitation block or a hybrid
Convolutional Block Attention Module, allowing adaptive recalibration of
channel and spatial feature representations. The proposed models are evaluated
on two distinct medical imaging datasets, a brain tumor MRI dataset comprising
multiple tumor subtypes, and a Products of Conception histopathological dataset
containing four tissue categories. Experimental results demonstrate that
attention augmented CNNs consistently outperform baseline architectures across
all metrics. In particular, EfficientNetB5 with hybrid attention achieves the
highest overall performance, delivering substantial gains on both datasets.
Beyond improved classification accuracy, attention mechanisms enhance feature
localization, leading to better generalization across heterogeneous imaging
modalities. This work contributes a systematic comparative framework for
embedding attention modules in diverse CNN architectures and rigorously
assesses their impact across multiple medical imaging tasks. The findings
provide practical insights for the development of robust, interpretable, and
clinically applicable deep learning based decision support systems.

Abstract: Timely and accurate detection of defects and contaminants in solar panels is
critical for maintaining the efficiency and reliability of photovoltaic
systems. This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of five
state-of-the-art object detection models: YOLOv3, Faster R-CNN, RetinaNet,
EfficientDet, and Swin Transformer, for identifying physical and electrical
defects as well as surface contaminants such as dust, dirt, and bird droppings
on solar panels. A custom dataset, annotated in the COCO format and
specifically designed for solar panel defect and contamination detection, was
developed alongside a user interface to train and evaluate the models. The
performance of each model is assessed and compared based on mean Average
Precision (mAP), precision, recall, and inference speed. The results
demonstrate the trade-offs between detection accuracy and computational
efficiency, highlighting the relative strengths and limitations of each model.
These findings provide valuable guidance for selecting appropriate detection
approaches in practical solar panel monitoring and maintenance scenarios.

Abstract: Instance segmentation is essential for numerous computer vision applications,
including robotics, human-computer interaction, and autonomous driving.
Currently, popular models bring impressive performance in instance segmentation
by training with a large number of human annotations, which are costly to
collect. For this reason, we present a new framework that efficiently and
effectively segments objects without the need for human annotations. Firstly, a
MultiCut algorithm is applied to self-supervised features for coarse mask
segmentation. Then, a mask filter is employed to obtain high-quality coarse
masks. To train the segmentation network, we compute a novel superpixel-guided
mask loss, comprising hard loss and soft loss, with high-quality coarse masks
and superpixels segmented from low-level image features. Lastly, a
self-training process with a new adaptive loss is proposed to improve the
quality of predicted masks. We conduct experiments on public datasets in
instance segmentation and object detection to demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed framework. The results show that the proposed framework
outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Cell biomechanics involve a great number of complex phenomena that are
fundamental to the evolution of life itself and other associated processes,
ranging from the very early stages of embryo-genesis to the maintenance of
damaged structures or the growth of tumors. Given the importance of such
phenomena, increasing research has been dedicated to their understanding, but
the many interactions between them and their influence on the decisions of
cells as a collective network or cluster remain unclear. We present a new
approach that combines Structure Preserving Neural Networks, which study cell
movements as a purely mechanical system, with other Machine Learning tools
(Artificial Neural Networks), which allow taking into consideration
environmental factors that can be directly deduced from an experiment with
Computer Vision techniques. This new model, tested on simulated and real cell
migration cases, predicts complete cell trajectories following a roll-out
policy with a high level of accuracy. This work also includes a mitosis event
prediction model based on Neural Networks architectures which makes use of the
same observed features.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的潜在生成模型在图像压缩过程中存在频率偏差，传统的优化目标本质上优先考虑低频重建，而忽略了高频细节，导致重建图像缺乏真实感，尤其是在细节丰富的纹理区域。

Method: 提出了一种基于小波变换的频率感知变分自动编码器（FA-VAE）框架。该方法显式地将低频和高频组件解耦合，分别进行优化，以改善细小纹理的重建质量，同时保持全局结构。

Result: 该方法能够有效地改善高频细节的重建质量，减少了图像的过度平滑和视觉伪影，提高了感知质量。

Conclusion: 频率感知的优化对于实现真实图像表示至关重要。FA-VAE框架为当前潜在生成模型存在的保真性问题提供了解决方案，对内容创作、神经渲染和医学成像等应用领域具有广泛意义。

Abstract: Latent generative models have shown remarkable progress in high-fidelity
image synthesis, typically using a two-stage training process that involves
compressing images into latent embeddings via learned tokenizers in the first
stage. The quality of generation strongly depends on how expressive and
well-optimized these latent embeddings are. While various methods have been
proposed to learn effective latent representations, the reconstructed images
often lack realism, particularly in textured regions with sharp transitions,
due to loss of fine details governed by high frequencies. We conduct a detailed
frequency decomposition of existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) latent tokenizers
and show that conventional objectives inherently prioritize low-frequency
reconstruction, often at the expense of high-frequency fidelity. Our analysis
reveals these latent tokenizers exhibit a bias toward low-frequency
information, when jointly optimized, leading to over-smoothed outputs and
visual artifacts that diminish perceptual quality. To address this, we propose
a wavelet-based, frequency-aware variational autoencoder (FA-VAE) framework
that explicitly decouples the optimization of low- and high-frequency
components. This decoupling enables improved reconstruction of fine textures
while preserving global structure. Our approach bridges the fidelity gap in
current latent tokenizers and emphasizes the importance of frequency-aware
optimization for realistic image representation, with broader implications for
applications in content creation, neural rendering, and medical imaging.

Abstract: Deep Convolutional Neural Networks have achieved state of the art performance
across various computer vision tasks, however their practical deployment is
limited by computational and memory overhead. This paper introduces
Differential Sensitivity Fusion Pruning, a novel single shot filter pruning
framework that focuses on evaluating the stability and redundancy of filter
importance scores across multiple criteria. Differential Sensitivity Fusion
Pruning computes a differential sensitivity score for each filter by fusing the
discrepancies among gradient based sensitivity, first order Taylor expansion,
and KL divergence of activation distributions. An exponential scaling mechanism
is applied to emphasize filters with inconsistent importance across metrics,
identifying candidates that are structurally unstable or less critical to the
model performance. Unlike iterative or reinforcement learning based pruning
strategies, Differential Sensitivity Fusion Pruning is efficient and
deterministic, requiring only a single forward-backward pass for scoring and
pruning. Extensive experiments across varying pruning rates between 50 to 70
percent demonstrate that Differential Sensitivity Fusion Pruning significantly
reduces model complexity, achieving over 80 percent Floating point Operations
Per Seconds reduction while maintaining high accuracy. For instance, at 70
percent pruning, our approach retains up to 98.23 percent of baseline accuracy,
surpassing traditional heuristics in both compression and generalization. The
proposed method presents an effective solution for scalable and adaptive Deep
Convolutional Neural Networks compression, paving the way for efficient
deployment on edge and mobile platforms.

Motivation: 解决YOLO架构在资源受限环境（如无人机）中部署的效率问题，探索不同层冻结策略对当代YOLOv8和YOLOv10的具体影响

Method: 系统性研究多种冻结配置，集成梯度行为分析（L2范数）和视觉解释（Grad-CAM）来提供训练动态深度见解

Result: 发现没有通用最佳冻结策略，而是依赖于数据特性：冻结背骨网络有效保留通用特征，浅层冻结更适合处理极端类别不平衡，节省达28% GPU内存，某些情况下mAP@50超过全量微调

Conclusion: 这项工作提供了实证性发现和实用指南，为资源有限场景下的对象检测进行平衡转移学习提供了基于证据的实践方法

Abstract: The You Only Look Once (YOLO) architecture is crucial for real-time object
detection. However, deploying it in resource-constrained environments such as
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) requires efficient transfer learning. Although
layer freezing is a common technique, the specific impact of various freezing
configurations on contemporary YOLOv8 and YOLOv10 architectures remains
unexplored, particularly with regard to the interplay between freezing depth,
dataset characteristics, and training dynamics. This research addresses this
gap by presenting a detailed analysis of layer-freezing strategies. We
systematically investigate multiple freezing configurations across YOLOv8 and
YOLOv10 variants using four challenging datasets that represent critical
infrastructure monitoring. Our methodology integrates a gradient behavior
analysis (L2 norm) and visual explanations (Grad-CAM) to provide deeper
insights into training dynamics under different freezing strategies. Our
results reveal that there is no universal optimal freezing strategy but,
rather, one that depends on the properties of the data. For example, freezing
the backbone is effective for preserving general-purpose features, while a
shallower freeze is better suited to handling extreme class imbalance. These
configurations reduce graphics processing unit (GPU) memory consumption by up
to 28% compared to full fine-tuning and, in some cases, achieve mean average
precision (mAP@50) scores that surpass those of full fine-tuning. Gradient
analysis corroborates these findings, showing distinct convergence patterns for
moderately frozen models. Ultimately, this work provides empirical findings and
practical guidelines for selecting freezing strategies. It offers a practical,
evidence-based approach to balanced transfer learning for object detection in
scenarios with limited resources.

Conclusion: QUAN在资源受限的机器人系统中具有部署潜力，适用于需要旋转感知的其他领域应用。

Abstract: This paper introduces Quaternion Approximate Networks (QUAN), a novel deep
learning framework that leverages quaternion algebra for rotation equivariant
image classification and object detection. Unlike conventional quaternion
neural networks attempting to operate entirely in the quaternion domain, QUAN
approximates quaternion convolution through Hamilton product decomposition
using real-valued operations. This approach preserves geometric properties
while enabling efficient implementation with custom CUDA kernels. We introduce
Independent Quaternion Batch Normalization (IQBN) for training stability and
extend quaternion operations to spatial attention mechanisms. QUAN is evaluated
on image classification (CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet), object detection (COCO,
DOTA), and robotic perception tasks. In classification tasks, QUAN achieves
higher accuracy with fewer parameters and faster convergence compared to
existing convolution and quaternion-based models. For objection detection, QUAN
demonstrates improved parameter efficiency and rotation handling over standard
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) while establishing the SOTA for quaternion
CNNs in this downstream task. These results highlight its potential for
deployment in resource-constrained robotic systems requiring rotation-aware
perception and application in other domains.

Abstract: Recently, distilling open-vocabulary language features from 2D images into 3D
Gaussians has attracted significant attention. Although existing methods
achieve impressive language-based interactions of 3D scenes, we observe two
fundamental issues: background Gaussians contributing negligibly to a rendered
pixel get the same feature as the dominant foreground ones, and multi-view
inconsistencies due to view-specific noise in language embeddings. We introduce
Visibility-Aware Language Aggregation (VALA), a lightweight yet effective
method that computes marginal contributions for each ray and applies a
visibility-aware gate to retain only visible Gaussians. Moreover, we propose a
streaming weighted geometric median in cosine space to merge noisy multi-view
features. Our method yields a robust, view-consistent language feature
embedding in a fast and memory-efficient manner. VALA improves open-vocabulary
localization and segmentation across reference datasets, consistently
surpassing existing works.

Method: 使用修剪后的骨架序列进行预训练，提出新颖的数据增强策略"Shuffle and Warp"，引入Cross Permutation Contrasting (CPC)和Relative Order Reasoning (ROR)两个对比学习代理任务

Conclusion: 所提出的双代理对比学习框架能够有效学习适用于动作分割的多尺度特征表示，通过数据增强和对比学习策略提升了性能

Abstract: In this paper, a contrastive representation learning framework is proposed to
enhance human action segmentation via pre-training using trimmed (single
action) skeleton sequences. Unlike previous representation learning works that
are tailored for action recognition and that build upon isolated sequence-wise
representations, the proposed framework focuses on exploiting multi-scale
representations in conjunction with cross-sequence variations. More
specifically, it proposes a novel data augmentation strategy, 'Shuffle and
Warp', which exploits diverse multi-action permutations. The latter effectively
assists two surrogate tasks that are introduced in contrastive learning: Cross
Permutation Contrasting (CPC) and Relative Order Reasoning (ROR). In
optimization, CPC learns intra-class similarities by contrasting
representations of the same action class across different permutations, while
ROR reasons about inter-class contexts by predicting relative mapping between
two permutations. Together, these tasks enable a Dual-Surrogate Contrastive
Learning (DuoCLR) network to learn multi-scale feature representations
optimized for action segmentation. In experiments, DuoCLR is pre-trained on a
trimmed skeleton dataset and evaluated on an untrimmed dataset where it
demonstrates a significant boost over state-the-art comparatives in both
multi-class and multi-label action segmentation tasks. Lastly, ablation studies
are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of each component of the proposed
approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视了事件流的内在不完整性问题，这是由于动态视觉传感器的阈值机制在敏感性和噪声之间的批执所导致的。这种退化影响了运动先验知识的完整性，限制了事件导向去模糊的效果。

Method: 提出了一个具有特定模态解耦表征的健壮事件导向去模糊（RED）网络。首先引入了一种健壮性导向的批逐策略（RPS），通过随机遮蔽事件来导入不完整模式以增强系统的健壮性。其次提出了解耦的OmniAttention机制，显式地建模内部运动、运动间和跨模态的相关性。最后设计了两个交互模块来增强模糊图像中的运动敏感区域并向不完整事件表征注入语义上下文。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了事件流不完整性导致的运动先验知识退化问题，通过健壮性导向的训练策略和解耦注意力机制，显著提升了事件导向去模糊的效果和适应能力。

Abstract: Event cameras provide sparse yet temporally high-temporal-resolution motion
information, demonstrating great potential for motion deblurring. Existing
methods focus on cross-modal interaction, overlooking the inherent
incompleteness of event streams, which arises from the trade-off between
sensitivity and noise introduced by the thresholding mechanism of Dynamic
Vision Sensors (DVS). Such degradation compromises the integrity of motion
priors and limits the effectiveness of event-guided deblurring. To tackle these
challenges, we propose a Robust Event-guided Deblurring (RED) network with
modality-specific disentangled representation. First, we introduce a
Robustness-Oriented Perturbation Strategy (RPS) that applies random masking to
events, which exposes RED to incomplete patterns and then foster robustness
against various unknown scenario conditions.Next, a disentangled OmniAttention
is presented to explicitly model intra-motion, inter-motion, and cross-modality
correlations from two inherently distinct but complementary sources: blurry
images and partially disrupted events. Building on these reliable features, two
interactive modules are designed to enhance motion-sensitive areas in blurry
images and inject semantic context into incomplete event representations.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate RED
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and
robustness.

analysis. The approach prioritizes quantization of high-sensitivity parameters,
leveraging unquantized low-sensitivity parameters to compensate for
quantization errors, thereby mitigating accuracy degradation. Furthermore, by
exploiting column-wise clustering of parameter sensitivity, the method
introduces a row-parallel quantization framework with a globally shared inverse
Hessian matrix update mechanism, reducing computational complexity by an order
of magnitude. Experimental results on ResNet-50 and YOLOv5s demonstrate a
20-200-fold quantization speedup over the Optimal Brain Quantization baseline,
with mean accuracy loss below 0.3%, confirming the method's efficacy in
balancing efficiency and accuracy.

TL;DR: 基于3D Gaussian的头部重建与重现分离框架，仅需单张照片输入即可生成可控虚拟人物，支持90 FPS高帧率渲染


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统虚拟人物生成方法对多角度输入的依赖性，实现仅需单张照片的高效控制虚拟人物生成

Method: 基于WebSSL的大规模一次性Gaussian头部生成器，采用两阶段训练策略，分离的重建与重现框架设计

Result: 在512x512分辨率下达到90 FPS的高帧率渲染，重建模块参数扩大带来性能提升，驱动效率不受影响，超越当前最先进方法

Conclusion: 该分离框架通过单张照片输入实现了高效的可控虚拟人物生成，具有良好的扩展性和高频细节重建能力，为实时虚拟人物应用提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: In this paper, we explore a reconstruction and reenactment separated
framework for 3D Gaussians head, which requires only a single portrait image as
input to generate controllable avatar. Specifically, we developed a large-scale
one-shot gaussian head generator built upon WebSSL and employed a two-stage
training approach that significantly enhances the capabilities of
generalization and high-frequency texture reconstruction. During inference, an
ultra-lightweight gaussian avatar driven by control signals enables high
frame-rate rendering, achieving 90 FPS at a resolution of 512x512. We further
demonstrate that the proposed framework follows the scaling law, whereby
increasing the parameter scale of the reconstruction module leads to improved
performance. Moreover, thanks to the separation design, driving efficiency
remains unaffected. Finally, extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments
validate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

*Changtao Miao,Yi Zhang,Man Luo,Weiwei Feng,Kaiyuan Zheng,Qi Chu,Tao Gong,Jianshu Li,Yunfeng Diao,Wei Zhou,Joey Tianyi Zhou,Xiaoshuai Hao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MFFI多维人脸伪造图像数据集，针对现有Deepfake检测数据集在真实场景多样性不足的问题，通过四个维度增强真实性：更广泛的伪造方法、多样的面部场景、多样化的真实数据、多级退化操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI生成内容(AIGC)技术的快速发展使得人脸伪造更加复杂，对社会安全构成威胁。但现有Deepfake检测方法受限于数据集多样性不足，无法满足真实场景需求，特别是在未知伪造技术、面部场景变化、真实数据丰富度和现实传播退化等方面存在局限。

Method: 构建MFFI数据集，基于四个策略维度：1)包含50种不同伪造方法的更广泛伪造技术；2)多样化的面部场景；3)多样化的真实数据；4)多级退化操作。数据集包含1024K图像样本。

Result: 基准评估显示MFFI在场景复杂性、跨域泛化能力和检测难度梯度方面优于现有公共数据集，验证了其在模拟真实世界条件方面的技术先进性和实用性。

Conclusion: MFFI数据集通过多维度的真实性增强，为Deepfake检测提供了更接近真实场景的基准数据集，有助于提升检测模型在复杂现实环境中的性能。

Abstract: Rapid advances in Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) have
enabled increasingly sophisticated face forgeries, posing a significant threat
to social security. However, current Deepfake detection methods are limited by
constraints in existing datasets, which lack the diversity necessary in
real-world scenarios. Specifically, these data sets fall short in four key
areas: unknown of advanced forgery techniques, variability of facial scenes,
richness of real data, and degradation of real-world propagation. To address
these challenges, we propose the Multi-dimensional Face Forgery Image
(\textbf{MFFI}) dataset, tailored for real-world scenarios. MFFI enhances
realism based on four strategic dimensions: 1) Wider Forgery Methods; 2) Varied
Facial Scenes; 3) Diversified Authentic Data; 4) Multi-level Degradation
Operations. MFFI integrates $50$ different forgery methods and contains $1024K$
image samples. Benchmark evaluations show that MFFI outperforms existing public
datasets in terms of scene complexity, cross-domain generalization capability,
and detection difficulty gradients. These results validate the technical
advance and practical utility of MFFI in simulating real-world conditions. The
dataset and additional details are publicly available at

TL;DR: VideoGraph：一种基于语言引导的时空图建模方法，通过递归时空图网络将视频中的对象和帧分别建模为空间和时间图节点，实现视频摘要任务


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频摘要方法主要关注帧间的全局时序建模，但忽略了细粒度视觉实体（如对象）与视频主要内容的相关性。语言引导的视频摘要需要全面理解复杂真实世界视频的语义信息

Method: 提出递归时空图网络VideoGraph，将对象和帧分别作为空间图和时间图的节点，通过图边连接表示节点间的语义关系。引入语言查询来丰富节点表示，避免仅依赖视觉相似性，并采用递归策略优化图结构和关键帧分类

Result: 在多个通用和查询聚焦视频摘要基准测试中，VideoGraph在监督和无监督设置下均达到了最先进的性能

Conclusion: 通过语言引导的时空图建模方法能够有效捕获视频中对象和帧之间的语义关系，为视频摘要任务提供了新的有效解决方案

Abstract: Video summarization aims to select keyframes that are visually diverse and
can represent the whole story of a given video. Previous approaches have
focused on global interlinkability between frames in a video by temporal
modeling. However, fine-grained visual entities, such as objects, are also
highly related to the main content of the video. Moreover, language-guided
video summarization, which has recently been studied, requires a comprehensive
linguistic understanding of complex real-world videos. To consider how all the
objects are semantically related to each other, this paper regards video
summarization as a language-guided spatiotemporal graph modeling problem. We
present recursive spatiotemporal graph networks, called VideoGraph, which
formulate the objects and frames as nodes of the spatial and temporal graphs,
respectively. The nodes in each graph are connected and aggregated with graph
edges, representing the semantic relationships between the nodes. To prevent
the edges from being configured with visual similarity, we incorporate language
queries derived from the video into the graph node representations, enabling
them to contain semantic knowledge. In addition, we adopt a recursive strategy
to refine initial graphs and correctly classify each frame node as a keyframe.
In our experiments, VideoGraph achieves state-of-the-art performance on several
benchmarks for generic and query-focused video summarization in both supervised
and unsupervised manners. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自监督督表征学习方法主要关注全局表征，无法抓取局部语义和细粒度细节，不适合需要空间精度的密集预测任务

Method: 提出Patch-level Kernel Alignment (PaKA)对齐目标，通过对齐教师和学生模型的密集特征分布来抓取统计依赖关系，并研究专门为密集表征学习设计的整合增强策略

Result: 在多个密集视觉标准测试集上达到了最先进的结果

Conclusion: 该框架通过补丁级对齐和专门增强策略，有效地将现有语义知识转移到密集特征空间，为密集视觉任务提供了高效的表征学习方案

Abstract: Dense representations are essential for vision tasks that require spatial
precision and fine-grained detail. While most self-supervised representation
learning methods focus on global representations that summarize the image as a
whole, such approaches often fall short in capturing the localized semantics
necessary for dense prediction tasks. To overcome these limitations, we propose
a framework that builds on pretrained representations through additional
self-supervised learning, aiming to transfer existing semantic knowledge into
the dense feature space. Our method aligns the distributions of dense features
between a teacher and a student model. Specifically, we introduce Patch-level
Kernel Alignment (PaKA), a simple yet effective alignment objective that
captures statistical dependencies, thereby matching the structural
relationships of dense patches across the two models. In addition, we
investigate augmentation strategies specifically designed for dense
representation learning. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art results across
a variety of dense vision benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our
approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpecPrune-VLA是一种无需训练的双层剪枝方法，利用局部和全局信息进行智能token选择，在保持成功率的同时显著加速VLA模型推理


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型剪枝方法仅使用当前动作的局部信息，忽略了历史动作的全局上下文，导致成功率下降超过20%且加速效果有限。观察到连续动作间存在高度相似性，需要同时利用局部和全局信息进行更智能的token选择

Method: 1) 动作级静态剪枝：使用全局历史和局部上下文减少每个动作的视觉token；2) 层级动态剪枝：基于层级重要性逐层剪枝token；3) 轻量级动作感知控制器：按动作速度分类为粗/细粒度，调整剪枝强度（细粒度动作对剪枝更敏感）

Result: 在LIBERO数据集上，SpecPrune-VLA相比OpenVLA-OFT在NVIDIA A800上实现1.46倍加速，在NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090上实现1.57倍加速，且成功率损失可忽略不计

Conclusion: 通过结合局部和全局信息进行智能token选择，SpecPrune-VLA能够在保持VLA模型性能的同时显著提升推理速度，为计算密集型模型的加速提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Pruning accelerates compute-bound models by reducing computation. Recently
applied to Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, existing methods prune tokens
using only local info from current action, ignoring global context from prior
actions, causing >20% success rate drop and limited speedup. We observe high
similarity across consecutive actions and propose leveraging both local
(current) and global (past) info for smarter token selection. We introduce
SpecPrune-VLA, a training-free method with two-level pruning and heuristic
control: (1) Static pruning at action level: uses global history and local
context to reduce visual tokens per action; (2) Dynamic pruning at layer level:
prunes tokens per layer based on layer-specific importance; (3) Lightweight
action-aware controller: classifies actions as coarse/fine-grained (by speed),
adjusting pruning aggressiveness since fine-grained actions are
pruning-sensitive. Experiments on LIBERO show SpecPrune-VLA achieves 1.46 times
speedup on NVIDIA A800 and 1.57 times on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 vs.
OpenVLA-OFT, with negligible success rate loss.

*Kien Nguyen,Anh Tran,Cuong Pham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Subspace Mapping (SuMa)方法，专门用于有效擦除文本到图像扩散模型中的狭窄概念（如版权角色、名人），同时保持图像质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概念擦除方法无法同时实现鲁棒性和有效性，特别是对于狭窄概念（如版权内容、名人）的擦除存在挑战，这些概念与非目标概念距离较近，需要更精细的操作

Method: SuMa首先推导表示要擦除概念的目标子空间，然后通过将其映射到最小化两个子空间距离的参考子空间来中和目标概念

Result: 在四个任务（子类擦除、名人擦除、艺术风格擦除、实例擦除）上的实验表明，SuMa在图像质量上与专注于有效性的方法相当，同时在完整性方面与目标方法结果相当

Conclusion: SuMa方法能够有效解决狭窄概念擦除的挑战，实现了鲁棒性和有效性的平衡，为处理版权和法律问题提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: The rapid growth of text-to-image diffusion models has raised concerns about
their potential misuse in generating harmful or unauthorized contents. To
address these issues, several Concept Erasure methods have been proposed.
However, most of them fail to achieve both robustness, i.e., the ability to
robustly remove the target concept., and effectiveness, i.e., maintaining image
quality. While few recent techniques successfully achieve these goals for NSFW
concepts, none could handle narrow concepts such as copyrighted characters or
celebrities. Erasing these narrow concepts is critical in addressing copyright
and legal concerns. However, erasing them is challenging due to their close
distances to non-target neighboring concepts, requiring finer-grained
manipulation. In this paper, we introduce Subspace Mapping (SuMa), a novel
method specifically designed to achieve both robustness and effectiveness in
easing these narrow concepts. SuMa first derives a target subspace representing
the concept to be erased and then neutralizes it by mapping it to a reference
subspace that minimizes the distance between the two. This mapping ensures the
target concept is robustly erased while preserving image quality. We conduct
extensive experiments with SuMa across four tasks: subclass erasure, celebrity
erasure, artistic style erasure, and instance erasure and compare the results
with current state-of-the-art methods. Our method achieves image quality
comparable to approaches focused on effectiveness, while also yielding results
that are on par with methods targeting completeness.

Motivation: 航空遥感中的多光谱和RGB成像技术推动了精准农业的发展，但高光谱图像标注有限或无标注的情况下的分析具有挑战性。

Method: 采用自监督学习方法构建与植被特性相关的嵌入空间，创建树木的神经网络表示。

Result: 实验结果表明，使用植被特性相关嵌入空间构建的树木表示，在下游机器学习任务中性能优于直接使用高光谱植被特性作为树木表示的方法。

Conclusion: 自监督学习能够有效提取高光谱图像中的植被特性信息，构建的神经网络嵌入表示在下游任务中具有更好的性能表现。

Abstract: Aerial remote sensing using multispectral and RGB imagers has provided a
critical impetus to precision agriculture. Analysis of the hyperspectral images
with limited or no labels is challenging. This paper focuses on self-supervised
learning to create neural network embeddings reflecting vegetation properties
of trees from aerial hyperspectral images of crop fields. Experimental results
demonstrate that a constructed tree representation, using a vegetation
property-related embedding space, performs better in downstream machine
learning tasks compared to the direct use of hyperspectral vegetation
properties as tree representations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 因为基于非孜加拉尼数据集训练的车辆检测系统在孜加拉尼独特的道路环境中无法准确识别本土车辆类型，导致自动驾驶技术在发展中地区存在关键缺口。

Method: 研究使用手机摄像头拍摄高分辨率图片(1920x1080)，通过LabelImg手动标注YOLO格式的边框围，构建了包含29个特定车辆类别的自定义数据集，并对六种YOLO模型变体进行性能评估。

Result: YOLOv11x表现最佳，达到63.7% mAP@0.5和43.8% mAP@0.5:0.95，但推理时间较长(45.8毫秒)。中等模型(YOLOv8m、YOLOv11m)在62.5%和61.8% mAP@0.5的性能下保持14-15毫秒的正常推理时间。罕见车辆类别(如建筑车辆和Desi Nosimons)几乎无法检测，视觉相似车辆间存在错误分类。

Conclusion: 这项研究为开发适用于孜加担尼交通条件的健壮物体检测系统奠定了基础，解决了传统通用模型在发展中地区无法满足需求的关键问题，推动了自动驾驶技术在发展中地区的进步。

Abstract: Vehicle detection systems trained on Non-Bangladeshi datasets struggle to
accurately identify local vehicle types in Bangladesh's unique road
environments, creating critical gaps in autonomous driving technology for
developing regions. This study evaluates six YOLO model variants on a custom
dataset featuring 29 distinct vehicle classes, including region-specific
vehicles such as ``Desi Nosimon'', ``Leguna'', ``Battery Rickshaw'', and
``CNG''. The dataset comprises high-resolution images (1920x1080) captured
across various Bangladeshi roads using mobile phone cameras and manually
annotated using LabelImg with YOLO format bounding boxes. Performance
evaluation revealed YOLOv11x as the top performer, achieving 63.7\% mAP@0.5,
43.8\% mAP@0.5:0.95, 61.4\% recall, and 61.6\% F1-score, though requiring 45.8
milliseconds per image for inference. Medium variants (YOLOv8m, YOLOv11m)
struck an optimal balance, delivering robust detection performance with mAP@0.5
values of 62.5\% and 61.8\% respectively, while maintaining moderate inference
times around 14-15 milliseconds. The study identified significant detection
challenges for rare vehicle classes, with Construction Vehicles and Desi
Nosimons showing near-zero accuracy due to dataset imbalances and insufficient
training samples. Confusion matrices revealed frequent misclassifications
between visually similar vehicles, particularly Mini Trucks versus Mini Covered
Vans. This research provides a foundation for developing robust object
detection systems specifically adapted to Bangladesh traffic conditions,
addressing critical needs in autonomous vehicle technology advancement for
developing regions where conventional generic-trained models fail to perform
adequately.

TL;DR: EditIDv2是一个无需调优的解决方案，专门针对高复杂度叙事场景和长文本输入，通过改进ID特征整合模块和引入新训练策略，在保持身份一致性的同时实现深度语义编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有角色编辑方法在简单提示下表现良好，但在面对包含多层语义、时间逻辑和复杂上下文关系的长文本叙事时，往往出现编辑能力下降、语义理解偏差和身份一致性崩溃的问题。

Method: 通过PerceiverAttention的精细分解、引入ID损失和与扩散模型的联合动态训练，以及整合模块的离线融合策略，在少量数据润滑下实现深度多级语义编辑。

Result: 在复杂叙事环境中保持身份一致性的同时实现深度语义编辑，满足长提示词和高质量图像生成的需求，在IBench评估中取得优异结果。

Conclusion: EditIDv2成功解决了长文本叙事场景下的角色编辑挑战，通过创新的架构设计和训练策略实现了高质量的语义编辑和身份保持。

Abstract: We propose EditIDv2, a tuning-free solution specifically designed for
high-complexity narrative scenes and long text inputs. Existing character
editing methods perform well under simple prompts, but often suffer from
degraded editing capabilities, semantic understanding biases, and identity
consistency breakdowns when faced with long text narratives containing multiple
semantic layers, temporal logic, and complex contextual relationships. In
EditID, we analyzed the impact of the ID integration module on editability. In
EditIDv2, we further explore and address the influence of the ID feature
integration module. The core of EditIDv2 is to discuss the issue of editability
injection under minimal data lubrication. Through a sophisticated decomposition
of PerceiverAttention, the introduction of ID loss and joint dynamic training
with the diffusion model, as well as an offline fusion strategy for the
integration module, we achieve deep, multi-level semantic editing while
maintaining identity consistency in complex narrative environments using only a
small amount of data lubrication. This meets the demands of long prompts and
high-quality image generation, and achieves excellent results in the IBench
evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有场景图预测方法主要依赖视觉线索，难以有效整合常识知识，限制了长期预测的鲁棒性

Method: 采用对象导向的两阶段方法(OOTSM)：首先用LLM预测物体出现和消失，然后生成详细的人-物关系，使用纯文本模型进行场景图预测

Result: 短期mean-Recall(@10)提升3.4%，长期mean-Recall(@50)大幅提升21.9%，在Action Genome基准上表现优异

Conclusion: 语言场景图预测(LSGA)作为独立任务具有研究价值，OOTSM方法有效整合了常识知识，显著提升了场景图预测性能

Abstract: A scene graph is a structured represention of objects and their relationships
in a scene. Scene Graph Anticipation (SGA) involves predicting future scene
graphs from video clips, enabling applications as intelligent surveillance and
human-machine collaboration. Existing SGA approaches primarily leverage visual
cues, often struggling to integrate valuable commonsense knowledge, thereby
limiting long-term prediction robustness. To explicitly leverage such
commonsense knowledge, we propose a new approach to better understand the
objects, concepts, and relationships in a scene graph. Our approach decouples
the SGA task in two steps: first a scene graph capturing model is used to
convert a video clip into a sequence of scene graphs, then a pure text-based
model is used to predict scene graphs in future frames. Our focus in this work
is on the second step, and we call it Linguistic Scene Graph Anticipation
(LSGA) and believes it should have independent interest beyond the use in SGA
discussed here. For LSGA, we introduce an Object-Oriented Two-Staged Method
(OOTSM) where an Large Language Model (LLM) first forecasts object appearances
and disappearances before generating detailed human-object relations. We
conduct extensive experiments to evaluate OOTSM in two settings. For LSGA, we
evaluate our fine-tuned open-sourced LLMs against zero-shot APIs (i.e., GPT-4o,
GPT-4o-mini, and DeepSeek-V3) on a benchmark constructed from Action Genome
annotations. For SGA, we combine our OOTSM with STTran++ from, and our
experiments demonstrate effective state-of-the-art performance: short-term
mean-Recall (@10) increases by 3.4% while long-term mean-Recall (@50) improves
dramatically by 21.9%. Code is available at https://github.com/ZhuXMMM/OOTSM.

TL;DR: 将高能物理中处理粒子对撞机pileup噪声的物理原理（守恒性、局域性、隔离性）转化为神经网络中的归纳偏置，构建物理启发的图像去噪模型，在强噪声条件下展现更好的鲁棒性


<details>

Motivation: 高能粒子物理中的pileup噪声处理策略（基于物理先验如守恒性、局域性和隔离性）可以启发图像去噪任务，探索物理启发的归纳偏置是否能提升模型在强噪声条件下的鲁棒性

Method: 提出层次化的PU-inspired去噪器：带守恒约束的残差CNN、高斯噪声变体，以及将物理原理集成到UNet骨干中的WIPUNet模型

Result: 在CIFAR-10和BSD500数据集上，PU-inspired CNN与标准基线相当，而WIPUNet在高噪声水平（σ=75,100）下表现出显著优势，显示物理启发先验在强噪声下提供稳定性

Conclusion: 物理启发的归纳偏置可以模块化地集成到神经网络架构中，在不依赖复杂SOTA技术的情况下，显著提升模型在高噪声条件下的鲁棒性能

Abstract: In high-energy particle physics, collider measurements are contaminated by
"pileup", overlapping soft interactions that obscure the hard-scatter signal of
interest. Dedicated subtraction strategies exploit physical priors such as
conservation, locality, and isolation. Inspired by this analogy, we investigate
how such principles can inform image denoising by embedding physics-guided
inductive biases into neural architectures. This paper is a proof of concept:
rather than targeting state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmarks, we ask whether
physics-inspired priors improve robustness under strong corruption.
  We introduce a hierarchy of PU-inspired denoisers: a residual CNN with
conservation constraints, its Gaussian-noise variants, and the Weighted
Inductive Pileup-physics-inspired U-Network for Denoising (WIPUNet), which
integrates these ideas into a UNet backbone. On CIFAR-10 with Gaussian noise at
$\sigma\in\{15,25,50,75,100\}$, PU-inspired CNNs are competitive with standard
baselines, while WIPUNet shows a \emph{widening margin} at higher noise.
Complementary BSD500 experiments show the same trend, suggesting
physics-inspired priors provide stability where purely data-driven models
degrade. Our contributions are: (i) translating pileup-mitigation principles
into modular inductive biases; (ii) integrating them into UNet; and (iii)
demonstrating robustness gains at high noise without relying on heavy SOTA
machinery.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型和视觉语言大模型在单轮任务中表现优异，但在需要深度上下文理解和复杂视觉推理的多轮交互中面临挑战，容易出现推理碎片化、上下文丢失和幻觉问题。

Method: 提出CAMVR框架，包含两个关键创新：1) 视觉-文本上下文记忆单元(VCMU)，动态存储和管理每轮交互的关键视觉特征、文本语义表示及其跨模态对应关系；2) 自适应视觉聚焦指导(AVFG)机制，利用VCMU上下文动态调整视觉编码器对上下文相关图像区域的注意力。

Result: 在VisDial、改进的A-OKVQA和新型多轮指令跟随(MTIF)数据集上的广泛实验表明，CAMVR始终实现最先进的性能。

Conclusion: CAMVR框架通过创新的记忆管理和注意力机制，有效提升了多轮视觉-文本推理的连贯性和准确性，为解决多轮视觉对话中的核心挑战提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs)
excel in single-turn tasks but face significant challenges in multi-turn
interactions requiring deep contextual understanding and complex visual
reasoning, often leading to fragmented reasoning, context loss, and
hallucinations. To address these limitations, we propose Context-Aware
Multi-Turn Visual Reasoning (CAMVR), a novel framework designed to empower
LVLMs with robust and coherent multi-turn visual-textual inference
capabilities. CAMVR introduces two key innovations: a Visual-Textual Context
Memory Unit (VCMU), a dynamic read-write memory network that stores and manages
critical visual features, textual semantic representations, and their
cross-modal correspondences from each interaction turn; and an Adaptive Visual
Focus Guidance (AVFG) mechanism, which leverages the VCMU's context to
dynamically adjust the visual encoder's attention to contextually relevant
image regions. Our multi-level reasoning integration strategy ensures that
response generation is deeply coherent with both current inputs and accumulated
historical context. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets, including
VisDial, an adapted A-OKVQA, and our novel Multi-Turn Instruction Following
(MTIF) dataset, demonstrate that CAMVR consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像分割领域的可重复性危机部分源于评估指标实现的不一致性，基于距离的指标在不同开源工具中存在显著差异，需要更可靠的实现方法。

Method: 提出MeshMetrics框架，采用基于网格的方法而非传统的基于网格的方法来计算Hausdorff距离和归一化表面距离等指标，减少离散化伪影的影响。

Conclusion: MeshMetrics提供了一个更精确的基于距离的分割评估指标计算框架，作为开源Python包发布，有助于提高分割评估的可靠性和可重复性。

Abstract: The surge of research in image segmentation has yielded remarkable
performance gains but also exposed a reproducibility crisis. A major
contributor is performance evaluation, where both selection and implementation
of metrics play critical roles. While recent efforts have improved the former,
the reliability of metric implementation has received far less attention.
Pitfalls in distance-based metric implementation can lead to considerable
discrepancies between common open-source tools, for instance, exceeding 100 mm
for the Hausdorff distance and 30%pt for the normalized surface distance for
the same pair of segmentations. To address these pitfalls, we introduce
MeshMetrics, a mesh-based framework that provides a more precise computation of
distance-based metrics than conventional grid-based approaches. Through
theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate that MeshMetrics
achieves higher accuracy and precision than established tools, and is
substantially less affected by discretization artifacts, such as distance
quantization. We release MeshMetrics as an open-source Python package,
available at https://github.com/gasperpodobnik/MeshMetrics.

*Jingwei Peng,Zhixuan Qiu,Boyu Jin,Surasakdi Siripong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LVLM-VAR是一个基于预训练视觉语言大模型的新型视频动作识别框架，通过视频到语义标记转换和LoRA微调，在NTU数据集上实现了最先进的性能（94.1%和90.0%）并显著提升了模型可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在深度语义理解、复杂上下文信息和细粒度区分方面存在局限，特别是在处理多样化视频数据时。受大型语言模型强大能力的启发，需要开发能够更好理解视频动作语义的新方法。

Method: 提出Video-to-Semantic-Tokens (VST)模块，将原始视频序列转换为离散的语义和时间一致的"语义动作标记"，创建LVLM可理解的"动作叙述"。结合自然语言指令，通过LoRA微调的LVLM（如LLaVA-13B）进行处理，实现动作分类和语义推理。

Result: 在NTU RGB+D和NTU RGB+D 120等挑战性基准测试中达到最先进或极具竞争力的性能：NTU RGB+D X-Sub达到94.1%，NTU RGB+D 120 X-Set达到90.0%。同时通过生成自然语言解释显著提升了模型可解释性。

Conclusion: LVLM-VAR框架成功将预训练视觉语言大模型应用于视频动作识别，不仅实现了优异的识别精度，还通过语义标记和自然语言解释增强了模型的可解释性，为视频理解任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Human action recognition often struggles with deep semantic understanding,
complex contextual information, and fine-grained distinction, limitations that
traditional methods frequently encounter when dealing with diverse video data.
Inspired by the remarkable capabilities of large language models, this paper
introduces LVLM-VAR, a novel framework that pioneers the application of
pre-trained Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) to video action recognition,
emphasizing enhanced accuracy and interpretability. Our method features a
Video-to-Semantic-Tokens (VST) Module, which innovatively transforms raw video
sequences into discrete, semantically and temporally consistent "semantic
action tokens," effectively crafting an "action narrative" that is
comprehensible to an LVLM. These tokens, combined with natural language
instructions, are then processed by a LoRA-fine-tuned LVLM (e.g., LLaVA-13B)
for robust action classification and semantic reasoning. LVLM-VAR not only
achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance on challenging
benchmarks such as NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120, demonstrating significant
improvements (e.g., 94.1% on NTU RGB+D X-Sub and 90.0% on NTU RGB+D 120 X-Set),
but also substantially boosts model interpretability by generating natural
language explanations for its predictions.

Motivation: 现有的跨视角地理定位方法主要依赖RGB图像的语义特征，往往忽略了空间结构信息在捕捉视角不变特征中的重要性。视角差异和外观变化给无人机定位导航带来巨大挑战。

Method: 使用双分支特征提取框架，结合差异感知融合模块(DAFM)和联合约束交互聚合(JCIA)策略，深度融合RGB和法线图像的语义与结构信息。提出3D地理增强技术生成潜在视角变化样本。

Result: 在University-1652和SUES-200数据集上的大量实验验证了该方法对复杂视角变化的鲁棒性，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过融合几何结构信息和语义信息，JRN-Geo网络能够有效处理跨视角地理定位中的视角差异问题，为无人机定位导航提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization plays a critical role in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
(UAV) localization and navigation. However, significant challenges arise from
the drastic viewpoint differences and appearance variations between images.
Existing methods predominantly rely on semantic features from RGB images, often
neglecting the importance of spatial structural information in capturing
viewpoint-invariant features. To address this issue, we incorporate geometric
structural information from normal images and introduce a Joint perception
network to integrate RGB and Normal images (JRN-Geo). Our approach utilizes a
dual-branch feature extraction framework, leveraging a Difference-Aware Fusion
Module (DAFM) and Joint-Constrained Interaction Aggregation (JCIA) strategy to
enable deep fusion and joint-constrained semantic and structural information
representation. Furthermore, we propose a 3D geographic augmentation technique
to generate potential viewpoint variation samples, enhancing the network's
ability to learn viewpoint-invariant features. Extensive experiments on the
University-1652 and SUES-200 datasets validate the robustness of our method
against complex viewpoint ariations, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: LiDAR-BIND-T扩展了多模态融合框架，通过时间一致性机制提升雷达/声纳到LiDAR转换的时空连贯性，显著改善SLAM性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态传感器融合中的时间不一致问题，提升下游SLAM任务的鲁棒性和性能

Method: 引入三种时间一致性机制：时间嵌入相似性对齐、运动对齐变换损失、窗口时间融合模块，并更新模型架构以保持空间结构

Result: 在雷达/声纳到LiDAR转换任务中表现出更好的时空连贯性，降低了绝对轨迹误差，提高了Cartographer SLAM中的占据地图精度

Conclusion: LiDAR-BIND-T保持了即插即用的模态融合特性，同时显著增强了时间稳定性，为下游SLAM应用提供了更鲁棒的解决方案

Abstract: This paper extends LiDAR-BIND, a modular multi-modal fusion framework that
binds heterogeneous sensors (radar, sonar) to a LiDAR-defined latent space,
with mechanisms that explicitly enforce temporal consistency. We introduce
three contributions: (i) temporal embedding similarity that aligns consecutive
latents, (ii) a motion-aligned transformation loss that matches displacement
between predictions and ground truth LiDAR, and (iii) windows temporal fusion
using a specialised temporal module. We further update the model architecture
to better preserve spatial structure. Evaluations on radar/sonar-to-LiDAR
translation demonstrate improved temporal and spatial coherence, yielding lower
absolute trajectory error and better occupancy map accuracy in
Cartographer-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping). We propose
different metrics based on the Fr\'echet Video Motion Distance (FVMD) and a
correlation-peak distance metric providing practical temporal quality
indicators to evaluate SLAM performance. The proposed temporal LiDAR-BIND, or
LiDAR-BIND-T, maintains plug-and-play modality fusion while substantially
enhancing temporal stability, resulting in improved robustness and performance
for downstream SLAM.

TL;DR: 提出了Multi-LVI-SAM多相机LiDAR-视觉-惯性里程计框架，通过全景视觉特征模型统一多鱼眼相机数据，结合因子图紧耦合方法，显著提高了状态估计的精度和鲁棒性。

Motivation: 为了解决多相机系统中视觉信息融合效率低、一致性差的问题，以及相机帧与全景模型帧不对齐导致的三角测量不一致性，需要开发一个能够统一处理多相机观测的全局优化框架。

Method: 1) 提出全景视觉特征模型，将多相机观测统一为单一表示；2) 设计外参补偿方法解决帧不对齐问题；3) 基于因子图实现LiDAR-视觉-惯性紧耦合系统集成。

Result: 在公开数据集上的实验表明，全景视觉特征模型提高了多相机约束的质量和一致性，相比现有多相机LiDAR-视觉-惯性系统具有更高的精度和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Multi-LVI-SAM框架通过全景视觉特征模型和外参补偿方法，有效解决了多相机系统的融合挑战，为高精度鲁棒状态估计提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a multi-camera LiDAR-visual-inertial odometry framework,
Multi-LVI-SAM, which fuses data from multiple fisheye cameras, LiDAR and
inertial sensors for highly accurate and robust state estimation. To enable
efficient and consistent integration of visual information from multiple
fisheye cameras, we introduce a panoramic visual feature model that unifies
multi-camera observations into a single representation. The panoramic model
serves as a global geometric optimization framework that consolidates
multi-view constraints, enabling seamless loop closure and global pose
optimization, while simplifying system design by avoiding redundant handling of
individual cameras. To address the triangulation inconsistency caused by the
misalignment between each camera's frame and the panoramic model's frame, we
propose an extrinsic compensation method. This method improves feature
consistency across views and significantly reduces triangulation and
optimization errors, leading to more accurate pose estimation. We integrate the
panoramic visual feature model into a tightly coupled LiDAR-visual-inertial
system based on a factor graph. Extensive experiments on public datasets
demonstrate that the panoramic visual feature model enhances the quality and
consistency of multi-camera constraints, resulting in higher accuracy and
robustness than existing multi-camera LiDAR-visual-inertial systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于深度适配的超分辨框架，通过空间变化逆问题形式化和神经网络实现，解决传统方法在实际场景中深度依赖性降级问题，在多个数据集上达到了独创性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单图超分辨方法假设空间不变的降级模型，但真实成像系统存在大气散射、景深变化和透视扭曲等复杂的距离依赖效应，需要空间适配的重建策略来结合几何场景理解以获得最佳性能。

Method: 提出严格的变分框架，将超分辨形式化为空间变化逆问题，使用伪微分运算符并包含距离依赖的谱特征。神经网络通过渗透殊殊块实现离散梯度流动力学，使用深度条件卷积内核确保收敛到理论能量函数的稳定点，学习的距离适配正则化项根据本地几何结构动态调整平滑性约束。

Result: 在5个标准数据集上达到最先进性能，在KITTI户外场景上在2倍和4倍缩放下分别获得36.89/0.9516和30.54/0.8721的PSNR/SSIM值，超过现有方法0.44dB和0.36dB。这是第一个理论基础坚实的距离适配超分辨框架，在深度变化场景中显著改善性能同时在传统标准上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 该工作建立了首个理论基础坚实的距离适配超分辨框架，通过结合变分理论分析和深度条件神经网络实现，有效解决了真实场景中空间变化降约问题，为超分辨领域提供了新的理论基础和实践方向。

Abstract: Single image super-resolution traditionally assumes spatially-invariant
degradation models, yet real-world imaging systems exhibit complex
distance-dependent effects including atmospheric scattering, depth-of-field
variations, and perspective distortions. This fundamental limitation
necessitates spatially-adaptive reconstruction strategies that explicitly
incorporate geometric scene understanding for optimal performance. We propose a
rigorous variational framework that characterizes super-resolution as a
spatially-varying inverse problem, formulating the degradation operator as a
pseudodifferential operator with distance-dependent spectral characteristics
that enable theoretical analysis of reconstruction limits across depth ranges.
Our neural architecture implements discrete gradient flow dynamics through
cascaded residual blocks with depth-conditional convolution kernels, ensuring
convergence to stationary points of the theoretical energy functional while
incorporating learned distance-adaptive regularization terms that dynamically
adjust smoothness constraints based on local geometric structure. Spectral
constraints derived from atmospheric scattering theory prevent bandwidth
violations and noise amplification in far-field regions, while adaptive kernel
generation networks learn continuous mappings from depth to reconstruction
filters. Comprehensive evaluation across five benchmark datasets demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance, achieving 36.89/0.9516 and 30.54/0.8721 PSNR/SSIM
at 2 and 4 scales on KITTI outdoor scenes, outperforming existing methods by
0.44dB and 0.36dB respectively. This work establishes the first
theoretically-grounded distance-adaptive super-resolution framework and
demonstrates significant improvements on depth-variant scenarios while
maintaining competitive performance across traditional benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了InterAct数据集和基于扩散的方法，用于从语音输入同时生成两个人的交互式面部表情和身体动作，解决了长期动态交互行为捕捉的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作大多只考虑单人或固定姿态的对话手势，无法准确捕捉日常场景中两人动态、语义一致的长时间交互行为。

Method: 采集了包含241个运动序列的多模态数据集InterAct，并提出分层回归身体动作的扩散方法，以及改进嘴唇准确性的微调机制。

Result: InterAct数据集包含丰富复杂的个体运动和长期交互模式，提出的方法能有效从语音生成交互式表情和动作。

Conclusion: 该工作为动态交互行为研究提供了高质量数据集和有效方法，推动了多人交互建模的发展。

Abstract: We address the problem of accurate capture of interactive behaviors between
two people in daily scenarios. Most previous works either only consider one
person or solely focus on conversational gestures of two people, assuming the
body orientation and/or position of each actor are constant or barely change
over each interaction. In contrast, we propose to simultaneously model two
people's activities, and target objective-driven, dynamic, and semantically
consistent interactions which often span longer duration and cover bigger
space. To this end, we capture a new multi-modal dataset dubbed InterAct, which
is composed of 241 motion sequences where two people perform a realistic and
coherent scenario for one minute or longer over a complete interaction. For
each sequence, two actors are assigned different roles and emotion labels, and
collaborate to finish one task or conduct a common interaction activity. The
audios, body motions, and facial expressions of both persons are captured.
InterAct contains diverse and complex motions of individuals and interesting
and relatively long-term interaction patterns barely seen before. We also
demonstrate a simple yet effective diffusion-based method that estimates
interactive face expressions and body motions of two people from speech inputs.
Our method regresses the body motions in a hierarchical manner, and we also
propose a novel fine-tuning mechanism to improve the lip accuracy of facial
expressions. To facilitate further research, the data and code is made
available at https://hku-cg.github.io/interact/ .

Motivation: 当前方法在处理复杂组合描述时，整体视觉-语言融合方式存在困难，特别是在外观相似但运动和姿态不一致的对象场景中。

Method: 1) 将自然语言查询解析为结构化语义命令；2) 时空定位模块生成所有候选轨迹；3) 分层识别模块通过粗粒度运动推理和细粒度姿态验证两阶段选择正确目标。

Result: 在Ref-YouTube-VOS、Ref-DAVIS17和MeViS三个主要基准测试中取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: PARSE-VOS框架通过分层推理和LLM驱动的方法，有效解决了视频对象分割中的语言-视觉对齐挑战，无需训练即可实现优异性能。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment an object of
interest throughout a video based on a language description. The prominent
challenge lies in aligning static text with dynamic visual content,
particularly when objects exhibiting similar appearances with inconsistent
motion and poses. However, current methods often rely on a holistic
visual-language fusion that struggles with complex, compositional descriptions.
In this paper, we propose \textbf{PARSE-VOS}, a novel, training-free framework
powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), for a hierarchical, coarse-to-fine
reasoning across text and video domains. Our approach begins by parsing the
natural language query into structured semantic commands. Next, we introduce a
spatio-temporal grounding module that generates all candidate trajectories for
all potential target objects, guided by the parsed semantics. Finally, a
hierarchical identification module select the correct target through a
two-stage reasoning process: it first performs coarse-grained motion reasoning
with an LLM to narrow down candidates; if ambiguity remains, a fine-grained
pose verification stage is conditionally triggered to disambiguate. The final
output is an accurate segmentation mask for the target object.
\textbf{PARSE-VOS} achieved state-of-the-art performance on three major
benchmarks: Ref-YouTube-VOS, Ref-DAVIS17, and MeViS.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了AdCare-VLM，一种基于Video-LLaVA的多模态大视觉语言模型，用于通过病人视频进行药物遵循性的视觉问答分析。模型在自建的结核病药物监测视频数据集上进行微调，在多个测试配置下都超过了现有的VLM模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 慢性疾病需要严格的药物遵循性来防止病情加重和降低死亡率，但病人行为、医疗成本等因素很容易影响遵循性。需要一种能够通过视频分析来监测药物投服行为的技术方案。

Method: 使用临床专家标注的806个结核病药物监测视频构建了LLM-TB-VQA数据集，包含正面、负面和模糊的遵循案例。在Video-LLaVA基础上微调AdCare-VLM模型，识别视觉特征（如病人面部、药物、水、投服动作）与医学概念的关联关系，完善多模态表征对齐。

Result: 在多种配置下（预训练、普通微调、LoRA），AdCare-VLM都显著超过了LLaVA-V1.5和Chat-UniVi等现有VLM模型，绝对性能提升3.1%到3.54%。消融实验和注意力地图可视化验证了方法的有效性和可解释性。

Conclusion: AdCare-VLM作为一种专门的多模态大模型，能够通过视频分析有效监测药物遵循性，为慢性疾病管理提供了一种可靠的技术解决方案，具有重要的临床应用价值。

Abstract: Chronic diseases, including diabetes, hypertension, asthma, HIV-AIDS,
epilepsy, and tuberculosis, necessitate rigorous adherence to medication to
avert disease progression, manage symptoms, and decrease mortality rates.
Adherence is frequently undermined by factors including patient behavior,
caregiver support, elevated medical costs, and insufficient healthcare
infrastructure. We propose AdCare-VLM, a specialized Video-LLaVA-based
multimodal large vision language model (LVLM) aimed at visual question
answering (VQA) concerning medication adherence through patient videos. We
employ a private dataset comprising 806 custom-annotated tuberculosis (TB)
medication monitoring videos, which have been labeled by clinical experts, to
fine-tune the model for adherence pattern detection. We present LLM-TB-VQA, a
detailed medical adherence VQA dataset that encompasses positive, negative, and
ambiguous adherence cases. Our method identifies correlations between visual
features, such as the clear visibility of the patient's face, medication, water
intake, and the act of ingestion, and their associated medical concepts in
captions. This facilitates the integration of aligned visual-linguistic
representations and improves multimodal interactions. Experimental results
indicate that our method surpasses parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
enabled VLM models, such as LLaVA-V1.5 and Chat-UniVi, with absolute
improvements ranging from 3.1% to 3.54% across pre-trained, regular, and
low-rank adaptation (LoRA) configurations. Comprehensive ablation studies and
attention map visualizations substantiate our approach, enhancing
interpretability.

Conclusion: 该数据集可为未来甲骨文导向的LMMs的视觉注意力评估和优化提供支持，促进甲骨文视觉解读技术的发展。

Abstract: Deciphering oracle bone characters (OBCs), the oldest attested form of
written Chinese, has remained the ultimate, unwavering goal of scholars,
offering an irreplaceable key to understanding humanity's early modes of
production. Current decipherment methodologies of OBC are primarily constrained
by the sporadic nature of archaeological excavations and the limited corpus of
inscriptions. With the powerful visual perception capability of large
multimodal models (LMMs), the potential of using LMMs for visually deciphering
OBCs has increased. In this paper, we introduce PictOBI-20k, a dataset designed
to evaluate LMMs on the visual decipherment tasks of pictographic OBCs. It
includes 20k meticulously collected OBC and real object images, forming over
15k multi-choice questions. We also conduct subjective annotations to
investigate the consistency of the reference point between humans and LMMs in
visual reasoning. Experiments indicate that general LMMs possess preliminary
visual decipherment skills, and LMMs are not effectively using visual
information, while most of the time they are limited by language priors. We
hope that our dataset can facilitate the evaluation and optimization of visual
attention in future OBC-oriented LMMs. The code and dataset will be available
at https://github.com/OBI-Future/PictOBI-20k.

Abstract: In medical imaging, point distribution models are often used to reconstruct
and complete partial shapes using a statistical model of the full shape. A
commonly overlooked, but crucial factor in this reconstruction process, is the
pose of the training data relative to the partial target shape. A difference in
pose alignment of the training and target shape leads to biased solutions,
particularly when observing small parts of a shape. In this paper, we
demonstrate the importance of pose alignment for partial shape reconstructions
and propose an efficient method to adjust an existing model to a specific
target. Our method preserves the computational efficiency of linear models
while significantly improving reconstruction accuracy and predicted variance.
It exactly recovers the intended aligned model for translations, and provides a
good approximation for small rotations, all without access to the original
training data. Hence, existing shape models in reconstruction pipelines can be
adapted by a simple preprocessing step, making our approach widely applicable
in plug-and-play scenarios.

Conclusion: 本文提出的框架成功克服了PointPillars的两大限制，通过3DPillars结构和两阶段检测流程，实现了基于伪图像表示的高效高性能3D物体检测，为快速且准确的3D检测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: PointPillars is the fastest 3D object detector that exploits pseudo image
representations to encode features for 3D objects in a scene. Albeit efficient,
PointPillars is typically outperformed by state-of-the-art 3D detection methods
due to the following limitations: 1) The pseudo image representations fail to
preserve precise 3D structures, and 2) they make it difficult to adopt a
two-stage detection pipeline using 3D object proposals that typically shows
better performance than a single-stage approach. We introduce in this paper the
first two-stage 3D detection framework exploiting pseudo image representations,
narrowing the performance gaps between PointPillars and state-of-the-art
methods, while retaining its efficiency. Our framework consists of two novel
components that overcome the aforementioned limitations of PointPillars: First,
we introduce a new CNN architecture, dubbed 3DPillars, that enables learning 3D
voxel-based features from the pseudo image representation efficiently using 2D
convolutions. The basic idea behind 3DPillars is that 3D features from voxels
can be viewed as a stack of pseudo images. To implement this idea, we propose a
separable voxel feature module that extracts voxel-based features without using
3D convolutions. Second, we introduce an RoI head with a sparse scene context
feature module that aggregates multi-scale features from 3DPillars to obtain a
sparse scene feature. This enables adopting a two-stage pipeline effectively,
and fully leveraging contextual information of a scene to refine 3D object
proposals. Experimental results on the KITTI and Waymo Open datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, achieving a good
compromise in terms of speed and accuracy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法中，前向投影方法生成稀疏BEV特征，反向投影方法存在深度模糊问题导致误检，需要结合相机和雷达的互补优势来解决这些问题

Method: 使用反向投影方法，通过雷达信息缓解深度模糊；在视角变换过程中聚合透视图像特征到BEV查询；结合图像密集但不准确的深度分布与雷达稀疏但精确的深度信息；引入包含雷达上下文信息的空间交叉注意力机制

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，3D目标检测达到62.4% NDS和54.0% mAP，在基于反向投影的相机-雷达融合方法中达到最先进性能

Conclusion: CRAB模型通过有效的相机-雷达融合策略，成功解决了深度模糊问题，在3D目标检测和分割任务中表现出优异的性能

Abstract: Recently, camera-radar fusion-based 3D object detection methods in bird's eye
view (BEV) have gained attention due to the complementary characteristics and
cost-effectiveness of these sensors. Previous approaches using forward
projection struggle with sparse BEV feature generation, while those employing
backward projection overlook depth ambiguity, leading to false positives. In
this paper, to address the aforementioned limitations, we propose a novel
camera-radar fusion-based 3D object detection and segmentation model named CRAB
(Camera-Radar fusion for reducing depth Ambiguity in Backward projection-based
view transformation), using a backward projection that leverages radar to
mitigate depth ambiguity. During the view transformation, CRAB aggregates
perspective view image context features into BEV queries. It improves depth
distinction among queries along the same ray by combining the dense but
unreliable depth distribution from images with the sparse yet precise depth
information from radar occupancy. We further introduce spatial cross-attention
with a feature map containing radar context information to enhance the
comprehension of the 3D scene. When evaluated on the nuScenes open dataset, our
proposed approach achieves a state-of-the-art performance among backward
projection-based camera-radar fusion methods with 62.4\% NDS and 54.0\% mAP in
3D object detection.

TL;DR: 提出了两种注意力引导的自编码器架构用于医疗设备制造中的深度异常检测，分别基于结构相似性评分和马氏距离评分，在小型不平衡数据集上实现了高精度实时缺陷检测和监管合规监控。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗设备制造中的自动化视觉检测面临小样本、不平衡数据、高分辨率图像和严格监管要求的挑战，需要开发既能满足实时检测需求又能符合监管标准的深度异常检测方法。

Method: 提出了两种注意力引导的自编码器架构：第一种使用4-MS-SSIM结构相似性异常评分进行轻量级实时缺陷检测；第二种使用马氏距离对降维潜在特征进行评分，提供对分布偏移的高敏感性监控。

Result: 第一种方法在仅有10%缺陷样本的测试集上达到ACC 0.903（无监督阈值）和0.931（有监督阈值）；第二种方法在有监督阈值下达到ACC 0.722，两种方法均优于重新实现的基线方法。

Conclusion: 这两种方法提供了互补能力：第一种支持可靠的在线检测，第二种支持可扩展的生产后监控和监管合规监测，为在受监管制造环境中部署深度异常检测提供了实用途径，符合欧盟AI法案对高风险AI系统的要求。

Abstract: Automating visual inspection in medical device manufacturing remains
challenging due to small and imbalanced datasets, high-resolution imagery, and
stringent regulatory requirements. This work proposes two attention-guided
autoencoder architectures for deep anomaly detection designed to address these
constraints. The first employs a structural similarity-based anomaly score
(4-MS-SSIM), offering lightweight and accurate real-time defect detection,
yielding ACC 0.903 (unsupervised thresholding) and 0.931 (supervised
thresholding) on the - Surface Seal Image - Test split with only 10% of
defective samples. The second applies a feature-distance approach using
Mahalanobis scoring on reduced latent features, providing high sensitivity to
distributional shifts for supervisory monitoring, achieving ACC 0.722 with
supervised thresholding. Together, these methods deliver complementary
capabilities: the first supports reliable inline inspection, while the second
enables scalable post-production surveillance and regulatory compliance
monitoring. Experimental results demonstrate that both approaches surpass
re-implemented baselines and provide a practical pathway for deploying deep
anomaly detection in regulated manufacturing environments, aligning accuracy,
efficiency, and the regulatory obligations defined for high-risk AI systems
under the EU AI Act.

*Tyler Ward,Abdullah Imran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Probabilistic SAM是SAM的概率扩展版本，通过引入潜在变量空间和变分训练目标，能够生成反映人类标注变异性的多样化分割掩码，特别适用于医学图像中存在标注不确定性的场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的可提示分割模型（如SAM）是确定性的，只能为每个提示生成单一分割结果，无法捕捉真实世界任务中固有的模糊性。这在医学成像中尤其成问题，因为标注不确定性和专家间差异可能导致多个合理的分割结果。

Method: 在SAM框架中集成先验网络和后验网络，通过潜在变量空间调节提示嵌入，使用变分目标进行训练，学习生成多样化的分割掩码分布。

Result: 在LIDC-IDRI肺结节数据集上的评估显示，Probabilistic SAM能够产生与专家分歧一致的多样的输出结果，在不确定性感知指标上优于现有的概率基线方法。

Conclusion: Probabilistic SAM成功扩展了SAM的概率能力，能够有效处理医学图像分割中的不确定性，为不确定性感知的分割任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in promptable segmentation, such as the Segment Anything
Model (SAM), have enabled flexible, high-quality mask generation across a wide
range of visual domains. However, SAM and similar models remain fundamentally
deterministic, producing a single segmentation per object per prompt, and fail
to capture the inherent ambiguity present in many real-world tasks. This
limitation is particularly troublesome in medical imaging, where multiple
plausible segmentations may exist due to annotation uncertainty or inter-expert
variability. In this paper, we introduce Probabilistic SAM, a probabilistic
extension of SAM that models a distribution over segmentations conditioned on
both the input image and prompt. By incorporating a latent variable space and
training with a variational objective, our model learns to generate diverse and
plausible segmentation masks reflecting the variability in human annotations.
The architecture integrates a prior and posterior network into the SAM
framework, allowing latent codes to modulate the prompt embeddings during
inference. The latent space allows for efficient sampling during inference,
enabling uncertainty-aware outputs with minimal overhead. We evaluate
Probabilistic SAM on the public LIDC-IDRI lung nodule dataset and demonstrate
its ability to produce diverse outputs that align with expert disagreement,
outperforming existing probabilistic baselines on uncertainty-aware metrics.

Motivation: 沙尘暴对健康和能见度造成害处，需要从卫星图像中快速检测沙尘

Method: 使用3D卷积网络学习MODIS卫星的36个波段图像的空间-波段模式，分离沙尘、云层和地表特征，采用简单归一化和局部填充处理缺失数据

Result: 在17个独立MODIS场景中，模型达到约0.92的准确率，均方误差为0.014，在沙尘核心区域显示出强一致性

Conclusion: 聚合波段-空间学习能够提供全球范围的及时沙尘警报，使用更宽的输入窗口或注意力模型可进一步揑升边缘检测效果

Abstract: Dust storms harm health and reduce visibility; quick detection from
satellites is needed. We present a near real-time system that flags dust at the
pixel level using multi-band images from NASA's Terra and Aqua (MODIS). A 3D
convolutional network learns patterns across all 36 bands, plus split thermal
bands, to separate dust from clouds and surface features. Simple normalization
and local filling handle missing data. An improved version raises training
speed by 21x and supports fast processing of full scenes. On 17 independent
MODIS scenes, the model reaches about 0.92 accuracy with a mean squared error
of 0.014. Maps show strong agreement in plume cores, with most misses along
edges. These results show that joint band-and-space learning can provide timely
dust alerts at global scale; using wider input windows or attention-based
models may further sharpen edges.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of carotid artery structures in histopathological
images is vital for advancing cardiovascular disease research and diagnosis.
However, deep learning model development in this domain is constrained by the
scarcity of annotated cardiovascular histopathological data. This study
investigates a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art deep learning
segmentation models, including convolutional neural networks (U-Net,
DeepLabV3+), a Vision Transformer (SegFormer), and recent foundation models
(SAM, MedSAM, MedSAM+UNet), on a limited dataset of cardiovascular histology
images. Despite employing an extensive hyperparameter optimization strategy
with Bayesian search, our findings reveal that model performance is highly
sensitive to data splits, with minor differences driven more by statistical
noise than by true algorithmic superiority. This instability exposes the
limitations of standard benchmarking practices in low-data clinical settings
and challenges the assumption that performance rankings reflect meaningful
clinical utility.

Result: 实验结果表明BTCChat在变化描述和视觉问答任务上达到了最先进的性能

Conclusion: BTCChat通过创新的变化提取和提示增强机制，有效提升了双时相卫星图像的变化理解能力

Abstract: Bi-temporal satellite imagery supports critical applications such as urban
development monitoring and disaster assessment. Although powerful multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) have been applied in bi-temporal change analysis,
previous methods process image pairs through direct concatenation, inadequately
modeling temporal correlations and spatial semantic changes. This deficiency
hampers visual-semantic alignment in change understanding, thereby constraining
the overall effectiveness of current approaches. To address this gap, we
propose BTCChat, a multi-temporal MLLM with advanced bi-temporal change
understanding capability. BTCChat supports bi-temporal change captioning and
retains single-image interpretation capability. To better capture temporal
features and spatial semantic changes in image pairs, we design a Change
Extraction module. Moreover, to enhance the model's attention to spatial
details, we introduce a Prompt Augmentation mechanism, which incorporates
contextual clues into the prompt to enhance model performance. Experimental
results demonstrate that BTCChat achieves state-of-the-art performance on
change captioning and visual question answering tasks.

TL;DR: ViSK-GAT是一个新颖的多模态深度学习框架，结合视觉和骨骼坐标特征来分类肌肉骨骼风险，在复杂环境中实现了93%以上的准确率，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的肌肉骨骼风险评估方法大多设计用于受控环境，依赖单一数据类型，在复杂环境中可靠性不足。需要开发能够处理多模态数据的方法来早期准确评估运动员的肌肉骨骼风险。

Method: 提出ViSK-GAT框架，结合残差块和轻量级Transformer块学习空间和时间依赖性。包含两个新模块：细粒度注意力模块（FGAM）通过跨模态注意力精炼特征，多模态几何对应模块（MGCM）通过对齐图像特征和坐标表示增强跨模态一致性。构建了包含8个风险类别的多模态数据集。

Result: 验证准确率93.55%，测试准确率93.89%，精确率93.86%，F1分数93.85%，Cohen's Kappa和Matthews相关系数均为93%。回归结果显示低RMSE（0.1205）和MAE（0.0156），在9个流行迁移学习骨干网络中 consistently 优于先前方法。

Conclusion: ViSK-GAT模型推进了人工智能在肌肉骨骼风险分类中的应用，能够实现有影响力的早期干预，为运动医学提供了有效的风险评估工具。

Abstract: Musculoskeletal disorders pose significant risks to athletes, and assessing
risk early is important for prevention. However, most existing methods are
designed for controlled settings and fail to reliably assess risk in complex
environments due to their reliance on a single type of data. This research
proposes ViSK-GAT (Visual-Skeletal Geometric Attention Transformer), a novel
multimodal deep learning framework designed to classify musculoskeletal risk
using visual and skeletal coordinate-based features. In addition, a custom
multimodal dataset is constructed by combining visual data and skeletal
coordinates for risk assessment. Each sample is labeled into eight risk
categories based on the Rapid Entire Body Assessment system. ViSK-GAT combines
a Residual Block with a Lightweight Transformer Block to learn spatial and
temporal dependencies jointly. It incorporates two novel modules: the
Fine-Grained Attention Module (FGAM), which enables precise inter-modal feature
refinement through cross-attention between visual and skeletal inputs, and the
Multimodal Geometric Correspondence Module (MGCM), which enhances cross-modal
coherence by aligning image features with coordinate-based representations.
ViSK-GAT achieved strong performance with validation and test accuracies of
93.55\% and 93.89\%, respectively; a precision of 93.86\%; an F1 score of
93.85\%; and Cohen's Kappa and Matthews Correlation Coefficient of 93\%. The
regression results also indicated a low Root Mean Square Error of the predicted
probability distribution of 0.1205 and a corresponding Mean Absolute Error of
0.0156. Compared to nine popular transfer learning backbones, ViSK-GAT
consistently outperformed previous methods. The ViSK-GAT model advances
artificial intelligence implementation and application, transforming
musculoskeletal risk classification and enabling impactful early interventions
in sports.

TL;DR: 基于CLIP模型的语义压缩方法，通过压缩特征嵌入而非像素重建，在极低比特率下保持跨任务语义完整性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像压缩方法注重像素级重建，但新兴应用更关注语义保持和跨数据分布的鲁棒性，需要新的语义压缩范式

Method: 利用多模态基础模型的零样本能力，将CLIP特征嵌入压缩为最小比特，同时保持不同任务间的语义信息

Result: 在基准数据集上保持语义完整性，平均比特率约2-3×10⁻³ bpp，比主流方法节省95%以上比特率

Conclusion: 该方法在极端压缩下仍能保持跨数据分布和下游任务的零样本鲁棒性，为语义压缩提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Recent deep learning-based methods for lossy image compression achieve
competitive rate-distortion performance through extensive end-to-end training
and advanced architectures. However, emerging applications increasingly
prioritize semantic preservation over pixel-level reconstruction and demand
robust performance across diverse data distributions and downstream tasks.
These challenges call for advanced semantic compression paradigms. Motivated by
the zero-shot and representational capabilities of multimodal foundation
models, we propose a novel semantic compression method based on the contrastive
language-image pretraining (CLIP) model. Rather than compressing images for
reconstruction, we propose compressing the CLIP feature embeddings into minimal
bits while preserving semantic information across different tasks. Experiments
show that our method maintains semantic integrity across benchmark datasets,
achieving an average bit rate of approximately 2-3* 10(-3) bits per pixel. This
is less than 5% of the bitrate required by mainstream image compression
approaches for comparable performance. Remarkably, even under extreme
compression, the proposed approach exhibits zero-shot robustness across diverse
data distributions and downstream tasks.

Motivation: 当前深度文本提示方法存在两个关键限制：1）过度依赖对比学习目标，只关注高层语义对齐而忽略细粒度特征优化；2）所有输入类别使用静态提示，缺乏内容感知适应能力。

Method: 提出了AttriPrompt框架，包含属性检索模块（聚类视觉特征并从提示池中检索语义相似的提示）、双流对比学习（实现细粒度对齐）和自正则化机制（防止在有限训练数据上过拟合）。

Result: 在三个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，AttriPrompt优于最先进的方法，在基础到新颖设置中实现了高达7.37%的改进，并在跨域知识转移方面表现出色。

Conclusion: 该方法使视觉语言预训练模型成为现实世界实施的更可行解决方案，通过层次化视觉信息和细粒度对齐显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: The evolution of prompt learning methodologies has driven exploration of
deeper prompt designs to enhance model performance. However, current deep text
prompting approaches suffer from two critical limitations: Over-reliance on
constrastive learning objectives that prioritize high-level semantic alignment,
neglecting fine-grained feature optimization; Static prompts across all input
categories, preventing content-aware adaptation. To address these limitations,
we propose AttriPrompt-a novel framework that enhances and refines textual
semantic representations by leveraging the intermediate-layer features of
CLIP's vision encoder. We designed an Attribute Retrieval module that first
clusters visual features from each layer. The aggregated visual features
retrieve semantically similar prompts from a prompt pool, which are then
concatenated to the input of every layer in the text encoder. Leveraging
hierarchical visual information embedded in prompted text features, we
introduce Dual-stream Contrastive Learning to realize fine-grained alignment.
Furthermore, we introduce a Self-Regularization mechanism by applying explicit
regularization constraints between the prompted and non-prompted text features
to prevent overfitting on limited training data. Extensive experiments across
three benchmarks demonstrate AttriPrompt's superiority over state-of-the-art
methods, achieving up to 7.37\% improvement in the base-to-novel setting. The
observed strength of our method in cross-domain knowledge transfer positions
vision-language pre-trained models as more viable solutions for real-world
implementation.

Conclusion: 该研究为流匹配模型的强化学习应用提供了一种更有效的采样方法，通过消除噪声干扰显著提升了奖励学习的性能和模型的可靠性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has recently emerged as a powerful technique for
improving image and video generation in Diffusion and Flow Matching models,
specifically for enhancing output quality and alignment with prompts. A
critical step for applying online RL methods on Flow Matching is the
introduction of stochasticity into the deterministic framework, commonly
realized by Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE). Our investigation reveals a
significant drawback to this approach: SDE-based sampling introduces pronounced
noise artifacts in the generated images, which we found to be detrimental to
the reward learning process. A rigorous theoretical analysis traces the origin
of this noise to an excess of stochasticity injected during inference. To
address this, we draw inspiration from Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models
(DDIM) to reformulate the sampling process. Our proposed method,
Coefficients-Preserving Sampling (CPS), eliminates these noise artifacts. This
leads to more accurate reward modeling, ultimately enabling faster and more
stable convergence for reinforcement learning-based optimizers like Flow-GRPO
and Dance-GRPO. Code will be released at https://github.com/IamCreateAI/FlowCPS

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效利用原始图和增强图的互补信息，提高医学图像边界分割的准确性

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a crucial method for assisting professionals in
diagnosing various diseases through medical imaging. However, various factors
such as noise, blurriness, and low contrast often hinder the accurate diagnosis
of diseases. While numerous image enhancement techniques can mitigate these
issues, they may also alter crucial information needed for accurate diagnosis
in the original image. Conventional image fusion strategies, such as feature
concatenation can address this challenge. However, they struggle to fully
leverage the advantages of both original and enhanced images while suppressing
the side effects of the enhancements. To overcome the problem, we propose a
dual interactive fusion module (DIFM) that effectively exploits mutual
complementary information from the original and enhanced images. DIFM employs
cross-attention bidirectionally to simultaneously attend to corresponding
spatial information across different images, subsequently refining the
complementary features via global spatial attention. This interaction leverages
low- to high-level features implicitly associated with diverse structural
attributes like edges, blobs, and object shapes, resulting in enhanced features
that embody important spatial characteristics. In addition, we introduce a
multi-scale boundary loss based on gradient extraction to improve segmentation
accuracy at object boundaries. Experimental results on the ACDC and Synapse
datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method quantitatively and
qualitatively. Code available at: https://github.com/JJeong-Gari/DIN

Abstract: The deployment of high-accuracy 3D object detection models from point cloud

integrates SAB with depthwise separable convolutions and a simple multiscale
fusion strategy, achieving end-to-end efficiency. Extensive experiments on the
KITTI dataset validate StripDet's superiority. With only 0.65M parameters, our
model achieves a 79.97% mAP for car detection, surpassing the baseline

Abstract: We propose a novel method to generate bloom lighting effect in real time
using neural networks. Our solution generate brightness mask from given 3D
scene view up to 30% faster than state-of-the-art methods. The existing
traditional techniques rely on multiple blur appliances and texture sampling,
also very often have existing conditional branching in its implementation.
These operations occupy big portion of the execution time. We solve this
problem by proposing two neural network-based bloom lighting methods, Neural
Bloom Lighting (NBL) and Fast Neural Bloom Lighting (FastNBL), focusing on
their quality and performance. Both methods were tested on a variety of 3D
scenes, with evaluations conducted on brightness mask accuracy and inference
speed. The main contribution of this work is that both methods produce
high-quality bloom effects while outperforming the standard state-of-the-art
bloom implementation, with FastNBL being faster by 28% and NBL faster by 12%.
These findings highlight that we can achieve realistic bloom lighting phenomena
faster, moving us towards more realism in real-time environments in the future.
This improvement saves computational resources, which is a major bottleneck in
real-time rendering. Furthermore, it is crucial for sustaining immersion and
ensuring smooth experiences in high FPS environments, while maintaining
high-quality realism.

Abstract: The application of self-supervised techniques has become increasingly
prevalent within medical visualization tasks, primarily due to its capacity to
mitigate the data scarcity prevalent in the healthcare sector. The majority of
current works are influenced by designs originating in the generic 2D visual
domain, which lack the intuitive demonstration of the model's learning process
regarding 3D spatial knowledge. Consequently, these methods often fall short in
terms of medical interpretability. We propose a method consisting of three
sub-tasks to capture the spatially relevant semantics in medical 3D imaging.
Their design adheres to observable principles to ensure interpretability, and
minimize the performance loss caused thereby as much as possible. By leveraging
the enhanced semantic depth offered by the extra dimension in 3D imaging, this
approach incorporates multi-granularity spatial relationship modeling to
maintain training stability. Experimental findings suggest that our approach is
capable of delivering performance that is on par with current methodologies,
while facilitating an intuitive understanding of the self-supervised learning
process.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniStyle2通过去风格化方法构建大规模数据集DST-100K，训练简单前馈模型在艺术风格迁移任务中超越现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决艺术风格迁移中缺乏真实监督数据的基本挑战，通过去风格化方法获得风格-内容对齐的真实监督信号

Method: 1) 开发DST文本引导去风格化模型重建无风格内容；2) 创建DST-Filter多阶段评估模型使用思维链推理自动筛选高质量数据对；3) 基于DST-100K数据集训练FLUX.1-dev前馈模型

Result: OmniStyle2在定性和定量基准测试中一致超越最先进方法

Conclusion: 通过去风格化的可扩展数据生成提供了可靠的监督范式，克服了艺术风格迁移中缺乏真实数据的基本挑战

Abstract: OmniStyle2 introduces a novel approach to artistic style transfer by
reframing it as a data problem. Our key insight is destylization, reversing
style transfer by removing stylistic elements from artworks to recover natural,
style-free counterparts. This yields DST-100K, a large-scale dataset that
provides authentic supervision signals by aligning real artistic styles with
their underlying content. To build DST-100K, we develop (1) DST, a text-guided
destylization model that reconstructs stylefree content, and (2) DST-Filter, a
multi-stage evaluation model that employs Chain-of-Thought reasoning to
automatically discard low-quality pairs while ensuring content fidelity and
style accuracy. Leveraging DST-100K, we train OmniStyle2, a simple feed-forward
model based on FLUX.1-dev. Despite its simplicity, OmniStyle2 consistently
surpasses state-of-the-art methods across both qualitative and quantitative
benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that scalable data generation via
destylization provides a reliable supervision paradigm, overcoming the
fundamental challenge posed by the lack of ground-truth data in artistic style
transfer.

TL;DR: 提出ConstStyle方法，通过将训练和测试数据映射到统一域来减少域偏移影响，在域泛化任务中显著优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度神经网络在测试数据分布与训练数据不同时性能下降的问题，特别是当训练域有限或与未见测试域差距较大时的域泛化挑战

Method: 使用统一域捕获域不变特征并桥接域差距，训练时将样本映射到优化后的统一域，测试时类似投影未见域样本

Result: 在多种场景下一致优于现有方法，当只有有限训练域时，准确率可比次优方法提升高达19.82%

Conclusion: ConstStyle通过统一域对齐有效减少域偏移影响，即使在大域差距或少量训练域情况下也能显著提升域泛化性能

Abstract: Deep neural networks often suffer performance drops when test data
distribution differs from training data. Domain Generalization (DG) aims to
address this by focusing on domain-invariant features or augmenting data for
greater diversity. However, these methods often struggle with limited training
domains or significant gaps between seen (training) and unseen (test) domains.
To enhance DG robustness, we hypothesize that it is essential for the model to
be trained on data from domains that closely resemble unseen test domains-an
inherently difficult task due to the absence of prior knowledge about the
unseen domains. Accordingly, we propose ConstStyle, a novel approach that
leverages a unified domain to capture domain-invariant features and bridge the
domain gap with theoretical analysis. During training, all samples are mapped
onto this unified domain, optimized for seen domains. During testing, unseen
domain samples are projected similarly before predictions. By aligning both
training and testing data within this unified domain, ConstStyle effectively
reduces the impact of domain shifts, even with large domain gaps or few seen
domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConstStyle consistently
outperforms existing methods across diverse scenarios. Notably, when only a
limited number of seen domains are available, ConstStyle can boost accuracy up
to 19.82\% compared to the next best approach.

Conclusion: STRIDE方法通过创新的指导策略和网络架构，有效提升了稀疏视图CT重建的质量，具有良好的泛化性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities in
image processing tasks. We propose a Sparse condition Temporal Rewighted
Integrated Distribution Estimation guided diffusion model (STRIDE) for
sparse-view CT reconstruction. Specifically, we design a joint training
mechanism guided by sparse conditional probabilities to facilitate the model
effective learning of missing projection view completion and global information
modeling. Based on systematic theoretical analysis, we propose a temporally
varying sparse condition reweighting guidance strategy to dynamically adjusts
weights during the progressive denoising process from pure noise to the real
image, enabling the model to progressively perceive sparse-view information.
The linear regression is employed to correct distributional shifts between
known and generated data, mitigating inconsistencies arising during the
guidance process. Furthermore, we construct a dual-network parallel
architecture to perform global correction and optimization across multiple
sub-frequency components, thereby effectively improving the model capability in
both detail restoration and structural preservation, ultimately achieving
high-quality image reconstruction. Experimental results on both public and real
datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the best improvement of
2.58 dB in PSNR, increase of 2.37\% in SSIM, and reduction of 0.236 in MSE
compared to the best-performing baseline methods. The reconstructed images
exhibit excellent generalization and robustness in terms of structural
consistency, detail restoration, and artifact suppression.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种解耦策略，通过注入预计算的语义分割先验信息来指导单目3D目标检测，无需扩展检测模型或联合学习先验，在KITTI基准上对小目标检测性能有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单目3D目标检测由于缺乏深度信息而具有挑战性，现有方法主要依赖RGB图像特征。本文旨在探索如何通过引入额外的分割信息来提升检测性能，而不增加模型复杂度。

Method: 采用解耦策略，将预计算的语义分割信息作为先验知识直接融合到特征空间中，引导检测过程，不扩展检测模型架构或添加额外的预测分支。

Result: 在KITTI 3D目标检测基准上，该方法在行人、自行车等小目标检测方面优于仅使用RGB特征的等效架构，证明了理解输入数据可以减少对额外传感器或训练数据的需求。

Conclusion: 通过注入分割先验信息可以有效提升单目3D目标检测性能，特别是在小目标检测方面，这种方法为平衡性能与计算复杂度提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Monocular 3D Object Detection represents a challenging Computer Vision task
due to the nature of the input used, which is a single 2D image, lacking in any
depth cues and placing the depth estimation problem as an ill-posed one.
Existing solutions leverage the information extracted from the input by using
Convolutional Neural Networks or Transformer architectures as feature
extraction backbones, followed by specific detection heads for 3D parameters
prediction. In this paper, we introduce a decoupled strategy based on injecting
precomputed segmentation information priors and fusing them directly into the
feature space for guiding the detection, without expanding the detection model
or jointly learning the priors. The focus is on evaluating the impact of
additional segmentation information on existing detection pipelines without
adding additional prediction branches. The proposed method is evaluated on the
KITTI 3D Object Detection Benchmark, outperforming the equivalent architecture
that relies only on RGB image features for small objects in the scene:
pedestrians and cyclists, and proving that understanding the input data can
balance the need for additional sensors or training data.

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合时序信息和运动动态，有效提升了单目视角空间飞行器位始估计的准确性和演进性能

Abstract: Monocular 6-DoF pose estimation plays an important role in multiple
spacecraft missions. Most existing pose estimation approaches rely on single
images with static keypoint localisation, failing to exploit valuable temporal
information inherent to space operations. In this work, we adapt a deep
learning framework from human pose estimation to the spacecraft pose estimation
domain that integrates motion-aware heatmaps and optical flow to capture motion
dynamics. Our approach combines image features from a Vision Transformer (ViT)
encoder with motion cues from a pre-trained optical flow model to localise 2D
keypoints. Using the estimates, a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) solver recovers
6-DoF poses from known 2D-3D correspondences. We train and evaluate our method
on the SPADES-RGB dataset and further assess its generalisation on real and
synthetic data from the SPARK-2024 dataset. Overall, our approach demonstrates
improved performance over single-image baselines in both 2D keypoint
localisation and 6-DoF pose estimation. Furthermore, it shows promising
generalisation capabilities when testing on different data distributions.

Abstract: As global interest in diverse culinary experiences grows, food image models
are essential for improving food-related applications by enabling accurate food
recognition, recipe suggestions, dietary tracking, and automated meal planning.
Despite the abundance of food datasets, a noticeable gap remains in capturing
the nuances of Indian cuisine due to its vast regional diversity, complex
preparations, and the lack of comprehensive labeled datasets that cover its
full breadth. Through this exploration, we uncover Khana, a new benchmark
dataset for food image classification, segmentation, and retrieval of dishes
from Indian cuisine. Khana fills the gap by establishing a taxonomy of Indian
cuisine and offering around 131K images in the dataset spread across 80 labels,
each with a resolution of 500x500 pixels. This paper describes the dataset
creation process and evaluates state-of-the-art models on classification,
segmentation, and retrieval as baselines. Khana bridges the gap between
research and development by providing a comprehensive and challenging benchmark

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VQA系统假设单一答案和区域，但盲人和低视力用户拍摄的照片模糊、构图不佳，提出的问题具有模糊性，导致多个有效答案对应不同图像区域

Method: 使用LoRA调优的BLIP-2模型生成多个候选答案，用PolyFormer进行空间定位，最后通过思维链推理模块评估答案是否指向相同或不同区域

Result: 在VQA-AnswerTherapy基准测试中优于先前方法，对辅助场景中常见的模糊性和视觉噪声更具鲁棒性

Conclusion: VQA系统需要适应真实的人类不确定性，为盲人和低视力用户提供包容性支持，该工作推动了相关研究和可访问性应用的发展

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) holds great potential for assisting Blind and
Low Vision (BLV) users, yet real-world usage remains challenging. Due to visual
impairments, BLV users often take blurry or poorly framed photos and face
difficulty in articulating specific questions about what they cannot fully see.
As a result, their visual questions are frequently ambiguous, and different
users may interpret them in diverse ways. This leads to multiple valid answers,
each grounded in different image regions-posing a mismatch with conventional
VQA systems that assume a single answer and region. To bridge this gap, we
present BLaVe-CoT, a VQA framework designed to reason about answer consistency
in the face of ambiguity. Our method proposes diverse candidate answers using a
LoRA-tuned BLIP-2 model, then grounds each answer spatially using PolyFormer,
and finally applies a chain-of-thought reasoning module to assess whether the
answers refer to the same or different regions. Evaluated on the
VQA-AnswerTherapy benchmark, BLaVe-CoT outperforms previous methods and proves
more robust to the ambiguity and visual noise common in assistive settings.
This work highlights the need for VQA systems that can adapt to real human
uncertainty and provide inclusive support for BLV users. To foster further
research and accessibility applications, we have made the code publicly
available at https://github.com/Accecwan/BLaVe-CoT.

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVD) has emerged as a pivotal technology
for applications involving Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). However, the
prevailing large-scale datasets for OVD pre-training are predominantly composed
of ground-level, natural images. This creates a significant domain gap, causing
models trained on them to exhibit a substantial drop in performance on UAV
imagery. To address this limitation, we first propose a refined UAV-Label
engine. Then we construct and introduce UAVDE-2M(contains over 2,000,000
instances and 1800 categories) and UAVCAP-15k(contains over 15,000 images).
Furthermore, we propose a novel Cross-Attention Gated Enhancement Fusion (CAGE)
module and integrate it into the YOLO-World-v2 architecture. Finally, extensive
experiments on the VisDrone and SIMD datasets verify the effectiveness of our
proposed method for applications in UAV-based imagery and remote sensing.

<details>

Motivation: 现有微表情识别方法存在局限性：手工特征方法需要关键帧，深度学习方法受限于小规模和低多样性的训练数据。需要一种能够有效捕捉微表情瞬时性、细微性和动态性的新方法。

Method: 提出FDP框架：1）使用局部-全局特征感知transformer学习帧表示；2）通过排序器计算帧级特征的排序分数；3）时间维度池化获取动态表示；4）同时进行微表情分类和动态图像构建任务，后者有助于捕捉面部细微动作并缓解数据稀缺问题。

Conclusion: FDP框架通过排序机制有效编码微表情的动态信息，结合transformer特征学习和动态图像构建任务，成功解决了微表情识别的挑战，在多个基准数据集上取得了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Facial micro-expression recognition (MER) is a challenging task, due to the
transience, subtlety, and dynamics of micro-expressions (MEs). Most existing
methods resort to hand-crafted features or deep networks, in which the former
often additionally requires key frames, and the latter suffers from small-scale
and low-diversity training data. In this paper, we develop a novel fine-grained
dynamic perception (FDP) framework for MER. We propose to rank frame-level
features of a sequence of raw frames in chronological order, in which the rank
process encodes the dynamic information of both ME appearances and motions.
Specifically, a novel local-global feature-aware transformer is proposed for
frame representation learning. A rank scorer is further adopted to calculate
rank scores of each frame-level feature. Afterwards, the rank features from
rank scorer are pooled in temporal dimension to capture dynamic representation.
Finally, the dynamic representation is shared by a MER module and a dynamic
image construction module, in which the former predicts the ME category, and
the latter uses an encoder-decoder structure to construct the dynamic image.
The design of dynamic image construction task is beneficial for capturing
facial subtle actions associated with MEs and alleviating the data scarcity
issue. Extensive experiments show that our method (i) significantly outperforms
the state-of-the-art MER methods, and (ii) works well for dynamic image
construction. Particularly, our FDP improves by 4.05%, 2.50%, 7.71%, and 2.11%
over the previous best results in terms of F1-score on the CASME II, SAMM,
CAS(ME)^2, and CAS(ME)^3 datasets, respectively. The code is available at

Abstract: Visual-LiDAR odometry is a critical component for autonomous system
localization, yet achieving high accuracy and strong robustness remains a
challenge. Traditional approaches commonly struggle with sensor misalignment,
fail to fully leverage temporal information, and require extensive manual
tuning to handle diverse sensor configurations. To address these problems, we
introduce DVLO4D, a novel visual-LiDAR odometry framework that leverages sparse
spatial-temporal fusion to enhance accuracy and robustness. Our approach
proposes three key innovations: (1) Sparse Query Fusion, which utilizes sparse
LiDAR queries for effective multi-modal data fusion; (2) a Temporal Interaction
and Update module that integrates temporally-predicted positions with current
frame data, providing better initialization values for pose estimation and
enhancing model's robustness against accumulative errors; and (3) a Temporal
Clip Training strategy combined with a Collective Average Loss mechanism that
aggregates losses across multiple frames, enabling global optimization and
reducing the scale drift over long sequences. Extensive experiments on the

Abstract: Automated inspection of transmission lines using UAVs is hindered by the
difficulty of detecting small and ambiguous defects against complex
backgrounds. Conventional detectors often suffer from detail loss due to
strided downsampling, weak boundary sensitivity in lightweight backbones, and
insufficient integration of global context with local cues. To address these
challenges, we propose TinyDef-DETR, a DETR-based framework designed for
small-defect detection. The method introduces a stride-free space-to-depth
module for lossless downsampling, an edge-enhanced convolution for
boundary-aware feature extraction, a cross-stage dual-domain multi-scale
attention module to jointly capture global and local information, and a
Focaler-Wise-SIoU regression loss to improve localization of small objects.
Experiments conducted on the CSG-ADCD dataset demonstrate that TinyDef-DETR
achieves substantial improvements in both precision and recall compared to
competitive baselines, with particularly notable gains on small-object subsets,
while incurring only modest computational overhead. Further validation on the
VisDrone benchmark confirms the generalization capability of the proposed
approach. Overall, the results indicate that integrating detail-preserving
downsampling, edge-sensitive representations, dual-domain attention, and
difficulty-adaptive regression provides a practical and efficient solution for
UAV-based small-defect inspection in power grids.

Conclusion: 交错推理方法能有效提升文本到图像生成的质量和细节保持能力，IRG框架为多模态理解与生成提供了新的有效途径

Abstract: Unified multimodal understanding and generation models recently have achieve
significant improvement in image generation capability, yet a large gap remains
in instruction following and detail preservation compared to systems that
tightly couple comprehension with generation such as GPT-4o. Motivated by
recent advances in interleaving reasoning, we explore whether such reasoning
can further improve Text-to-Image (T2I) generation. We introduce Interleaving
Reasoning Generation (IRG), a framework that alternates between text-based
thinking and image synthesis: the model first produces a text-based thinking to
guide an initial image, then reflects on the result to refine fine-grained
details, visual quality, and aesthetics while preserving semantics. To train
IRG effectively, we propose Interleaving Reasoning Generation Learning (IRGL),
which targets two sub-goals: (1) strengthening the initial think-and-generate
stage to establish core content and base quality, and (2) enabling high-quality
textual reflection and faithful implementation of those refinements in a
subsequent image. We curate IRGL-300K, a dataset organized into six decomposed
learning modes that jointly cover learning text-based thinking, and full
thinking-image trajectories. Starting from a unified foundation model that
natively emits interleaved text-image outputs, our two-stage training first
builds robust thinking and reflection, then efficiently tunes the IRG pipeline
in the full thinking-image trajectory data. Extensive experiments show SoTA
performance, yielding absolute gains of 5-10 points on GenEval, WISE, TIIF,
GenAI-Bench, and OneIG-EN, alongside substantial improvements in visual quality
and fine-grained fidelity. The code, model weights and datasets will be
released in: https://github.com/Osilly/Interleaving-Reasoning-Generation .

Conclusion: BranchGRPO通过效率优化和稳定性改进，在保持探索能力的同时显著提升了生成模型的人类偏好对齐效果

Abstract: Recent advancements in aligning image and video generative models via GRPO
have achieved remarkable gains in enhancing human preference alignment.
However, these methods still face high computational costs from on-policy
rollouts and excessive SDE sampling steps, as well as training instability due
to sparse rewards. In this paper, we propose BranchGRPO, a novel method that
introduces a branch sampling policy updating the SDE sampling process. By
sharing computation across common prefixes and pruning low-reward paths and
redundant depths, BranchGRPO substantially lowers the per-update compute cost
while maintaining or improving exploration diversity. This work makes three
main contributions: (1) a branch sampling scheme that reduces rollout and
training cost; (2) a tree-based advantage estimator incorporating dense
process-level rewards; and (3) pruning strategies exploiting path and depth
redundancy to accelerate convergence and boost performance. Experiments on
image and video preference alignment show that BranchGRPO improves alignment
scores by 16% over strong baselines, while cutting training time by 50%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高保真CFD模拟需要专家物理模型、细缆网格和大量计算，限制了迭代速度。图神经网络(GNN)能够从模拟数据中学习热流体行为，但传统GNN在高分辨率图结构中捕捉长距离依赖关系时遇到困难。

Method: 提出一种新的多阶段GNN架构，利用层次池化(hierarchical pooling)和反池化(unpooling)操作，在多个空间尺度上逐步建模全局到局部的相互作用。在不同长宽比矩形形式定制的CFD数据集上进行评估。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了提出的多阶段GNN方法在网格基础流体动力学模拟中建模复杂传热过程的潜力。

Abstract: Buoyancy-driven heat transfer in closed cavities serves as a canonical
testbed for thermal design High-fidelity CFD modelling yields accurate thermal
field solutions, yet its reliance on expert-crafted physics models, fine
meshes, and intensive computation limits rapid iteration. Recent developments
in data-driven modeling, especially Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), offer new
alternatives for learning thermal-fluid behavior directly from simulation data,
particularly on irregular mesh structures. However, conventional GNNs often
struggle to capture long-range dependencies in high-resolution graph
structures. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel multi-stage GNN
architecture that leverages hierarchical pooling and unpooling operations to
progressively model global-to-local interactions across multiple spatial
scales. We evaluate the proposed model on our newly developed CFD dataset
simulating natural convection within a rectangular cavities with varying aspect
ratios where the bottom wall is isothermal hot, the top wall is isothermal
cold, and the two vertical walls are adiabatic. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed model achieves higher predictive accuracy,
improved training efficiency, and reduced long-term error accumulation compared
to state-of-the-art (SOTA) GNN baselines. These findings underscore the
potential of the proposed multi-stage GNN approach for modeling complex heat
transfer in mesh-based fluid dynamics simulations.

Abstract: In this work, we develop a novel technique for reconstructing images from
projection-based nano- and microtomography. Our contribution focuses on
enhancing reconstruction quality, particularly for specimen composed of
homogeneous material phases connected by sharp edges. This is accomplished by
training a neural network to identify edges within subpictures. The trained
network is then integrated into a mathematical optimization model, to reduce
artifacts from previous reconstructions. To this end, the optimization approach
favors solutions according to the learned predictions, however may also
determine alternative solutions if these are strongly supported by the raw
data. Hence, our technique successfully incorporates knowledge about the
homogeneity and presence of sharp edges in the sample and thereby eliminates
blurriness. Our results on experimental datasets show significant enhancements
in interface sharpness and material homogeneity compared to benchmark
algorithms. Thus, our technique produces high-quality reconstructions,
showcasing its potential for advancing tomographic imaging techniques.

Motivation: 现有微调策略存在局限性：并行微调隔离任务无法利用共享知识，多任务微调需要同时访问所有数据集且难以增量集成新任务

Method: 提出MedSeqFT框架，包含两个核心组件：1) MDS选择下游样本中最具代表性的样本来保持通用知识；2) K&G RFT基于LoRA的知识蒸馏方案，平衡任务特定适应和预训练知识保持

Conclusion: 顺序微调是适应基础模型到临床任务演进的有效、知识保持的范式

Abstract: Foundation models have become a promising paradigm for advancing medical
image analysis, particularly for segmentation tasks where downstream
applications often emerge sequentially. Existing fine-tuning strategies,
however, remain limited: parallel fine-tuning isolates tasks and fails to
exploit shared knowledge, while multi-task fine-tuning requires simultaneous
access to all datasets and struggles with incremental task integration. To
address these challenges, we propose MedSeqFT, a sequential fine-tuning
framework that progressively adapts pre-trained models to new tasks while
refining their representational capacity. MedSeqFT introduces two core
components: (1) Maximum Data Similarity (MDS) selection, which identifies
downstream samples most representative of the original pre-training
distribution to preserve general knowledge, and (2) Knowledge and
Generalization Retention Fine-Tuning (K&G RFT), a LoRA-based knowledge
distillation scheme that balances task-specific adaptation with the retention
of pre-trained knowledge. Extensive experiments on two multi-task datasets
covering ten 3D segmentation tasks demonstrate that MedSeqFT consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art fine-tuning strategies, yielding substantial
performance gains (e.g., an average Dice improvement of 3.0%). Furthermore,
evaluations on two unseen tasks (COVID-19-20 and Kidney) verify that MedSeqFT
enhances transferability, particularly for tumor segmentation. Visual analyses
of loss landscapes and parameter variations further highlight the robustness of
MedSeqFT. These results establish sequential fine-tuning as an effective,
knowledge-retentive paradigm for adapting foundation models to evolving
clinical tasks. Code will be released.

Conclusion: 所提出的基准测试和训练方案显著提升了视觉语言模型在病理领域的表现，为解决病理图像分析中的复杂推理挑战提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Accurate analysis of pathological images is essential for automated tumor
diagnosis but remains challenging due to high structural similarity and subtle
morphological variations in tissue images. Current vision-language (VL) models
often struggle to capture the complex reasoning required for interpreting
structured pathological reports. To address these limitations, we propose
PathoHR-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate VL models' abilities in
hierarchical semantic understanding and compositional reasoning within the
pathology domain. Results of this benchmark reveal that existing VL models fail
to effectively model intricate cross-modal relationships, hence limiting their
applicability in clinical setting. To overcome this, we further introduce a
pathology-specific VL training scheme that generates enhanced and perturbed
samples for multimodal contrastive learning. Experimental evaluations
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on
PathoHR-Bench and six additional pathology datasets, highlighting its
effectiveness in fine-grained pathology representation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动图像聚类在图像增强应用中受限的问题，因为传统的基于语义属性的聚类方法难以定义对图像增强有意义的图像簇。

Method: 提出CARDIE无监督算法，基于图像的颜色和亮度内容进行聚类；同时引入量化图像增强算法对亮度分布和局部方差影响的方法。

Result: CARDIE生成的图像簇比基于语义属性的聚类更适用于图像增强任务；利用CARDIE簇重采样图像增强数据集可以提升色调映射和去噪算法的性能。

Conclusion: CARDIE为图像增强任务提供了更有效的图像聚类方法，通过基于颜色和亮度特征的聚类能够更好地支持图像增强算法的开发和评估。

Abstract: Automatic image clustering is a cornerstone of computer vision, yet its
application to image enhancement remains limited, primarily due to the
difficulty of defining clusters that are meaningful for this specific task. To
address this issue, we introduce CARDIE, an unsupervised algorithm that
clusters images based on their color and luminosity content. In addition, we
introduce a method to quantify the impact of image enhancement algorithms on
luminance distribution and local variance. Using this method, we demonstrate
that CARDIE produces clusters more relevant to image enhancement than those
derived from semantic image attributes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CARDIE
clusters can be leveraged to resample image enhancement datasets, leading to
improved performance for tone mapping and denoising algorithms. To encourage
adoption and ensure reproducibility, we publicly release CARDIE code on our
GitHub.

TL;DR: SpecSwin3D是一个基于Transformer的模型，能够从多光谱图像生成高光谱图像，在保持空间和光谱质量的同时显著提升了重建性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多光谱和高光谱图像在农业、环境监测等领域有广泛应用，但存在空间分辨率与光谱分辨率之间的权衡。现有方法难以同时保持空间细节和光谱保真度。

Method: 提出SpecSwin3D模型，使用3D移位窗口Transformer框架，采用级联训练策略逐步扩展光谱范围，并设计优化的波段序列来更好地捕捉波段间关系。

Result: 模型在PSNR上达到35.82dB，SAM为2.40°，SSIM为0.96，相比基线MHF-Net提升5.6dB PSNR，ERGAS降低超过一半。在下游任务如土地利用分类和火烧区域分割中也表现出实用价值。

Conclusion: SpecSwin3D通过Transformer架构和创新的训练策略，成功解决了多光谱到高光谱图像转换中的空间-光谱权衡问题，为相关应用提供了高质量的高光谱数据生成方案。

Abstract: Multispectral and hyperspectral imagery are widely used in agriculture,
environmental monitoring, and urban planning due to their complementary spatial
and spectral characteristics. A fundamental trade-off persists: multispectral
imagery offers high spatial but limited spectral resolution, while
hyperspectral imagery provides rich spectra at lower spatial resolution. Prior
hyperspectral generation approaches (e.g., pan-sharpening variants, matrix
factorization, CNNs) often struggle to jointly preserve spatial detail and
spectral fidelity. In response, we propose SpecSwin3D, a transformer-based
model that generates hyperspectral imagery from multispectral inputs while
preserving both spatial and spectral quality. Specifically, SpecSwin3D takes
five multispectral bands as input and reconstructs 224 hyperspectral bands at
the same spatial resolution. In addition, we observe that reconstruction errors
grow for hyperspectral bands spectrally distant from the input bands. To
address this, we introduce a cascade training strategy that progressively
expands the spectral range to stabilize learning and improve fidelity.
Moreover, we design an optimized band sequence that strategically repeats and
orders the five selected multispectral bands to better capture pairwise
relations within a 3D shifted-window transformer framework. Quantitatively, our
model achieves a PSNR of 35.82 dB, SAM of 2.40{\deg}, and SSIM of 0.96,
outperforming the baseline MHF-Net by +5.6 dB in PSNR and reducing ERGAS by
more than half. Beyond reconstruction, we further demonstrate the practical
value of SpecSwin3D on two downstream tasks, including land use classification
and burnt area segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI从医学图像中提取生物标志物（如视网膜年龄）存在隐私风险，未经授权使用可能导致生物信息泄露，需要保护个人隐私。

Method: 采用特征级生成对抗掩蔽机制，结合多对一知识蒸馏策略，利用视网膜基础模型和多样化替代年龄编码器来防御黑盒年龄预测模型。

Result: RetinaGuard成功混淆视网膜年龄预测，对图像质量和病理特征表示影响最小，可扩展到其他医学图像生物标志物。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了医学图像生物识别隐私问题，为保护敏感生物信息提供了可行的技术方案。

Abstract: The integration of AI with medical images enables the extraction of implicit
image-derived biomarkers for a precise health assessment. Recently, retinal
age, a biomarker predicted from fundus images, is a proven predictor of
systemic disease risks, behavioral patterns, aging trajectory and even
mortality. However, the capability to infer such sensitive biometric data
raises significant privacy risks, where unauthorized use of fundus images could
lead to bioinformation leakage, breaching individual privacy. In response, we
formulate a new research problem of biometric privacy associated with medical
images and propose RetinaGuard, a novel privacy-enhancing framework that
employs a feature-level generative adversarial masking mechanism to obscure
retinal age while preserving image visual quality and disease diagnostic
utility. The framework further utilizes a novel multiple-to-one knowledge
distillation strategy incorporating a retinal foundation model and diverse
surrogate age encoders to enable a universal defense against black-box age
prediction models. Comprehensive evaluations confirm that RetinaGuard
successfully obfuscates retinal age prediction with minimal impact on image
quality and pathological feature representation. RetinaGuard is also flexible
for extension to other medical image derived biomarkers. RetinaGuard is also
flexible for extension to other medical image biomarkers.

Conclusion: UniVerse-1通过创新的模型融合和标注技术，在音视频生成任务上取得了显著进展，为研究社区提供了有价值的资源和基准。

Abstract: We introduce UniVerse-1, a unified, Veo-3-like model capable of
simultaneously generating coordinated audio and video. To enhance training
efficiency, we bypass training from scratch and instead employ a stitching of
experts (SoE) technique. This approach deeply fuses the corresponding blocks of
pre-trained video and music generation experts models, thereby fully leveraging
their foundational capabilities. To ensure accurate annotations and temporal
alignment for both ambient sounds and speech with video content, we developed
an online annotation pipeline that processes the required training data and
generates labels during training process. This strategy circumvents the
performance degradation often caused by misalignment text-based annotations.
Through the synergy of these techniques, our model, after being finetuned on
approximately 7,600 hours of audio-video data, produces results with
well-coordinated audio-visuals for ambient sounds generation and strong
alignment for speech generation. To systematically evaluate our proposed
method, we introduce Verse-Bench, a new benchmark dataset. In an effort to
advance research in audio-video generation and to close the performance gap
with state-of-the-art models such as Veo3, we make our model and code publicly
available. We hope this contribution will benefit the broader research
community. Project page: https://dorniwang.github.io/UniVerse-1/.

Motivation: 现有的视频场景图生成方法通常针对特定粒度（框级或像素级），需要任务特定的架构和多阶段训练流程，缺乏统一的解决方案。

Method: 提出UNO框架，使用扩展槽注意机制将视觉特征分解为对象和关系槽，引入对象时序一致性学习确保跨帧表示一致性，动态三元组预测模块捕捉时序交互。

Conclusion: UNO证明了统一对象中心设计在视频场景图生成中的有效性，能够泛化到不同视觉粒度，减少任务特定修改并最大化参数共享。

Abstract: Video Scene Graph Generation (VidSGG) aims to represent dynamic visual
content by detecting objects and modeling their temporal interactions as
structured graphs. Prior studies typically target either coarse-grained
box-level or fine-grained panoptic pixel-level VidSGG, often requiring
task-specific architectures and multi-stage training pipelines. In this paper,
we present UNO (UNified Object-centric VidSGG), a single-stage, unified
framework that jointly addresses both tasks within an end-to-end architecture.
UNO is designed to minimize task-specific modifications and maximize parameter
sharing, enabling generalization across different levels of visual granularity.
The core of UNO is an extended slot attention mechanism that decomposes visual
features into object and relation slots. To ensure robust temporal modeling, we
introduce object temporal consistency learning, which enforces consistent
object representations across frames without relying on explicit tracking
modules. Additionally, a dynamic triplet prediction module links relation slots
to corresponding object pairs, capturing evolving interactions over time. We
evaluate UNO on standard box-level and pixel-level VidSGG benchmarks. Results
demonstrate that UNO not only achieves competitive performance across both
tasks but also offers improved efficiency through a unified, object-centric
design.

Abstract: Bone fractures present a major global health challenge, often resulting in
pain, reduced mobility, and productivity loss, particularly in low-resource
settings where access to expert radiology services is limited. Conventional
imaging methods suffer from high costs, radiation exposure, and dependency on
specialized interpretation. To address this, we developed an AI-based solution
for automated fracture detection from X-ray images using a custom Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) and benchmarked it against transfer learning models
including EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV2, and ResNet50. Training was conducted on
the publicly available FracAtlas dataset, comprising 4,083 anonymized
musculoskeletal radiographs. The custom CNN achieved 95.96% accuracy, 0.94
precision, 0.88 recall, and an F1-score of 0.91 on the FracAtlas dataset.
Although transfer learning models (EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV2, ResNet50)
performed poorly in this specific setup, these results should be interpreted in
light of class imbalance and data set limitations. This work highlights the
promise of lightweight CNNs for detecting fractures in X-rays and underscores
the importance of fair benchmarking, diverse datasets, and external validation
for clinical translation

Abstract: Object Recognition and Document Skew Estimation have come a long way in terms
of performance and efficiency. New models follow one of two directions:
improving performance using larger models, and improving efficiency using
smaller models. However, real-time document detection and rectification is a
niche that is largely unexplored by the literature, yet it remains a vital step
for automatic information retrieval from visual documents. In this work, we
strive towards an efficient document detection pipeline that is satisfactory in
terms of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) retrieval and faster than other
available solutions. We adapt IWPOD-Net, a license plate detection network, and
train it for detection on NBID, a synthetic ID card dataset. We experiment with
data augmentation and cross-dataset validation with MIDV (another synthetic ID
and passport document dataset) to find the optimal scenario for the model.
Other methods from both the Object Recognition and Skew Estimation
state-of-the-art are evaluated for comparison with our approach. We use each
method to detect and rectify the document, which is then read by an OCR system.
The OCR output is then evaluated using a novel OCR quality metric based on the
Levenshtein distance. Since the end goal is to improve automatic information
retrieval, we use the overall OCR quality as a performance metric. We observe
that with a promising model, document rectification does not have to be perfect
to attain state-of-the-art performance scores. We show that our model is
smaller and more efficient than current state-of-the-art solutions while
retaining a competitive OCR quality metric. All code is available at

### [95] [Spatial Reasoning with Vision-Language Models in Ego-Centric Multi-View Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06266)
*Mohsen Gholami,Ahmad Rezaei,Zhou Weimin,Yong Zhang,Mohammad Akbari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Ego3D-Bench基准测试和Ego3D-VLM框架，用于评估和提升视觉语言模型在自我中心多视角户外环境中的3D空间推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在3D空间关系理解方面存在局限，而现实世界的具身AI智能体（如机器人和自动驾驶汽车）依赖自我中心的多视角观察，需要更好的空间推理能力。

Method: 创建包含8,600+问答对的Ego3D-Bench基准测试，并开发Ego3D-VLM后训练框架，通过基于估计的全局3D坐标生成认知地图来增强空间推理。

Result: 基准测试显示当前VLMs与人类水平存在显著性能差距，Ego3D-VLM在多选题上平均提升12%，在绝对距离估计上平均提升56%。

Conclusion: Ego3D-Bench和Ego3D-VLM为在多视角环境中实现人类水平空间理解提供了有价值的工具，当前VLMs仍需改进空间推理能力。

Abstract: Understanding 3D spatial relationships remains a major limitation of current
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Prior work has addressed this issue by creating
spatial question-answering (QA) datasets based on single images or indoor
videos. However, real-world embodied AI agents such as robots and self-driving
cars typically rely on ego-centric, multi-view observations. To this end, we
introduce Ego3D-Bench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the spatial
reasoning abilities of VLMs using ego-centric, multi-view outdoor data.
Ego3D-Bench comprises over 8,600 QA pairs, created with significant involvement
from human annotators to ensure quality and diversity. We benchmark 16 SOTA
VLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini1.5-Pro, InternVL3, and Qwen2.5-VL. Our results
reveal a notable performance gap between human level scores and VLM
performance, highlighting that current VLMs still fall short of human level
spatial understanding. To bridge this gap, we propose Ego3D-VLM, a
post-training framework that enhances 3D spatial reasoning of VLMs. Ego3D-VLM
generates cognitive map based on estimated global 3D coordinates, resulting in
12% average improvement on multi-choice QA and 56% average improvement on
absolute distance estimation. Ego3D-VLM is modular and can be integrated with
any existing VLM. Together, Ego3D-Bench and Ego3D-VLM offer valuable tools for
advancing toward human level spatial understanding in real-world, multi-view
environments.

TL;DR: MVP-FAS是一个基于CLIP的面部反欺骗框架，通过多视角注意力机制和多文本补丁对齐模块，显著提升了跨域泛化性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于CLIP的面部反欺骗方法未能充分利用CLIP的补丁嵌入令牌，且依赖单一文本提示，限制了泛化能力

Method: 提出MVP-FAS框架，包含多视角注意力模块(MVS)提取局部细节和全局上下文特征，以及多文本补丁对齐模块(MTPA)通过多文本表示增强语义鲁棒性

Result: 在跨域数据集上超越了之前的最先进方法，展现出优异的泛化性能

Conclusion: MVP-FAS通过充分利用多文本表示和补丁级特征，有效解决了面部反欺骗中的域泛化问题

Abstract: Recent face anti-spoofing (FAS) methods have shown remarkable cross-domain
performance by employing vision-language models like CLIP. However, existing
CLIP-based FAS models do not fully exploit CLIP's patch embedding tokens,
failing to detect critical spoofing clues. Moreover, these models rely on a
single text prompt per class (e.g., 'live' or 'fake'), which limits
generalization. To address these issues, we propose MVP-FAS, a novel framework
incorporating two key modules: Multi-View Slot attention (MVS) and Multi-Text
Patch Alignment (MTPA). Both modules utilize multiple paraphrased texts to
generate generalized features and reduce dependence on domain-specific text.
MVS extracts local detailed spatial features and global context from patch
embeddings by leveraging diverse texts with multiple perspectives. MTPA aligns
patches with multiple text representations to improve semantic robustness.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVP-FAS achieves superior generalization
performance, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods on cross-domain
datasets. Code: https://github.com/Elune001/MVP-FAS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过智能手机自拍图像远程估算皮肤保水度和经皮失水量，提出了一种新的皮肤优先适应性视觉Transformer模型，解决了皮肤健康监测的可访问性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 皮肤健康与疾病抵抗力与皮肤屏障功能密切相关，但SH和TEWL指标需要专业仪器测量，普通用户无法方便获得。需要一种无侵入、可访问的皮肤健康监测方案。

Method: 提出了一个系统性解决方案，包括SH/TEWL数据收集、数据预处理，以及一种新的Skin-Prior Adaptive Vision Transformer模型用于SH/TEWL回归。识别了数据注释不平衡问题，并提出对称基对比正则化来减少模型偏差。

Result: 该研究首次探索了从自拍面部图像进行皮肤评估的可行性，无需物理测量。实验结果验证了模型的有效性。

Conclusion: 该工作桥接了计算机视觉与护肤研究之间的间隔，为更广泛的实际应用开启了AI驱动的可访问皮肤分析。

Abstract: Skin health and disease resistance are closely linked to the skin barrier
function, which protects against environmental factors and water loss. Two key
physiological indicators can quantitatively represent this barrier function:
skin hydration (SH) and trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL). Measurement of SH
and TEWL is valuable for the public to monitor skin conditions regularly,
diagnose dermatological issues, and personalize their skincare regimens.
However, these measurements are not easily accessible to general users unless
they visit a dermatology clinic with specialized instruments. To tackle this
problem, we propose a systematic solution to estimate SH and TEWL from selfie
facial images remotely with smartphones. Our solution encompasses multiple
stages, including SH/TEWL data collection, data preprocessing, and formulating
a novel Skin-Prior Adaptive Vision Transformer model for SH/TEWL regression.
Through experiments, we identified the annotation imbalance of the SH/TEWL data
and proposed a symmetric-based contrastive regularization to reduce the model
bias due to the imbalance effectively. This work is the first study to explore
skin assessment from selfie facial images without physical measurements. It
bridges the gap between computer vision and skin care research, enabling
AI-driven accessible skin analysis for broader real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PAML是一个针对视觉定位任务的原型感知多模态学习框架，通过改进跨模态对齐、特征融合和语义原型利用，在开放词汇场景中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于transformer的视觉定位方法在标准场景中表现良好，但在开放词汇场景（包含训练时未见过的物体类别）中存在三个主要限制：跨模态对齐不完善、跨模态特征融合不足、语义原型信息利用效率低。

Method: 提出了PAML框架，包含：1）使用ALBEF进行初始跨模态特征对齐；2）视觉判别特征编码器增强显著物体表示；3）新颖的原型发现和继承机制提取多邻居语义原型；4）多阶段解码器进行综合多模态整合和边界框回归。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上的广泛实验验证了该方法，在标准场景中具有竞争力，在开放词汇场景中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: PAML框架通过系统性解决跨模态对齐、特征融合和语义原型利用等关键问题，显著提升了视觉定位在开放词汇场景中的性能表现。

Abstract: Visual Grounding (VG) aims to utilize given natural language queries to
locate specific target objects within images. While current transformer-based
approaches demonstrate strong localization performance in standard scene (i.e,
scenarios without any novel objects), they exhibit notable limitations in
open-vocabulary scene (i.e, both familiar and novel object categories during
testing). These limitations primarily stem from three key factors: (1)
imperfect alignment between visual and linguistic modalities, (2) insufficient
cross-modal feature fusion, and (3) ineffective utilization of semantic
prototype information. To overcome these challenges, we present Prototype-Aware
Multimodal Learning (PAML), an innovative framework that systematically
addresses these issues through several key components: First, we leverage ALBEF
to establish robust cross-modal alignment during initial feature encoding.
Subsequently, our Visual Discriminative Feature Encoder selectively enhances
salient object representations while suppressing irrelevant visual context. The
framework then incorporates a novel prototype discovering and inheriting
mechanism that extracts and aggregates multi-neighbor semantic prototypes to
facilitate open-vocabulary recognition. These enriched features undergo
comprehensive multimodal integration through our Multi-stage Decoder before
final bounding box regression. Extensive experiments across five benchmark
datasets validate our approach, showing competitive performance in standard
scene while achieving state-of-the-art results in open-vocabulary scene. Our
code is available at https://github.com/plankXie/PAML.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文将广义类别发现(GCD)扩展到视频领域，提出了视频GCD新设置和一种新的内存导向一致性对比学习框架(MCCL)，通过时间-空间线索和全局上下文提升新类别发现的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GCD方法主要关注静态图像，但仅依靠静态视觉内容不能可靠地发现新类别。需要将GCD扩展到视频领域，利用时间维度信息来提升新类发现的性能。

Method: 提出MCCL框架，包含两个核心组件：一致性感知对比学习(CACL)和内存导向表征增强(MGRE)。CACL利用多视角时间特征估计一致性分数来加权对比损失，MGRE通过双层内存缓冲提供全局上下文来提升表征质量。

Result: 在动作识别和鸟类分类视频数据集上进行了评估，实验结果显示该方法显著超过了从图像设置适配的竞争性GCD方法。

Conclusion: 这项研究验证了时间信息在视频中发现新类别的重要性，提出的MCCL框架通过有效整合多视角时间特征和全局上下文，为视频GCD问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) is an emerging and challenging
open-world problem that has garnered increasing attention in recent years. Most
existing GCD methods focus on discovering categories in static images. However,
relying solely on static visual content is often insufficient to reliably
discover novel categories. To bridge this gap, we extend the GCD problem to the
video domain and introduce a new setting, termed Video-GCD. Thus, effectively
integrating multi-perspective information across time is crucial for accurate
Video-GCD. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel Memory-guided
Consistency-aware Contrastive Learning (MCCL) framework, which explicitly
captures temporal-spatial cues and incorporates them into contrastive learning
through a consistency-guided voting mechanism. MCCL consists of two core
components: Consistency-Aware Contrastive Learning(CACL) and Memory-Guided
Representation Enhancement (MGRE). CACL exploits multiperspective temporal
features to estimate consistency scores between unlabeled instances, which are
then used to weight the contrastive loss accordingly. MGRE introduces a
dual-level memory buffer that maintains both feature-level and logit-level
representations, providing global context to enhance intra-class compactness
and inter-class separability. This in turn refines the consistency estimation
in CACL, forming a mutually reinforcing feedback loop between representation
learning and consistency modeling. To facilitate a comprehensive evaluation, we
construct a new and challenging Video-GCD benchmark, which includes action
recognition and bird classification video datasets. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms competitive GCD
approaches adapted from image-based settings, highlighting the importance of
temporal information for discovering novel categories in videos. The code will
be publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统干旱压力检测方法耗时耗力，而现有深度学习模型参数量太大，不适合资源有限的农业环境。需要开发轻量化且高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出基于ResNet、DenseNet和MobileNet的轻量化混合CNN框架，进一步集成了基于梯度范数影响函数的机器忘印机制，支持针对性移除特定训练数据影响。

Conclusion: 该轻量化框架具有实用、可扩展和适应性强的特点，特别适用于资源突出条件下的精准农业干旱监测。

Abstract: Drought stress is a major threat to global crop productivity, making its
early and precise detection essential for sustainable agricultural management.
Traditional approaches, though useful, are often time-consuming and
labor-intensive, which has motivated the adoption of deep learning methods. In
recent years, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer
architectures have been widely explored for drought stress identification;
however, these models generally rely on a large number of trainable parameters,
restricting their use in resource-limited and real-time agricultural settings.
To address this challenge, we propose a novel lightweight hybrid CNN framework
inspired by ResNet, DenseNet, and MobileNet architectures. The framework
achieves a remarkable 15-fold reduction in trainable parameters compared to
conventional CNN and Vision Transformer models, while maintaining competitive
accuracy. In addition, we introduce a machine unlearning mechanism based on a
gradient norm-based influence function, which enables targeted removal of
specific training data influence, thereby improving model adaptability. The
method was evaluated on an aerial image dataset of potato fields with
expert-annotated healthy and drought-stressed regions. Experimental results
show that our framework achieves high accuracy while substantially lowering
computational costs. These findings highlight its potential as a practical,
scalable, and adaptive solution for drought stress monitoring in precision
agriculture, particularly under resource-constrained conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉-语言任务中表现优异，但如何有效整合图像分割功能仍是严峻挑战。需要一种简洁、高效的方法来实现图像分割与语言模型的无缝整合。

Method: 提出了文本作为掩码的新范式，通过语义描述符将分割掩码映射为文本标签。首先提出图像级语义描述符，然后为提高效率提出行向跐长编码(R-RLE)技术。最后提出盒子级语义描述符，使用语义砖结构表示区域掩码，将分割演算为下一个砖预测任务。

Result: 在自然图像和遥感图像数据集上进行了全面实验，Text4Seg++在多个标准测试集上一致超过当前最先进模型，而且无需任务特定微调。R-RLE技术将语义描述符长度减少74%，推理速度提升3倍。

Conclusion: 该工作证明了在MLLM框架内通过文本驱动方式实现图像分割的有效性、可扩展性和通用性，为多模态分割提供了一种简洁而高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown exceptional capabilities
in vision-language tasks. However, effectively integrating image segmentation
into these models remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a
novel text-as-mask paradigm that casts image segmentation as a text generation
problem, eliminating the need for additional decoders and significantly
simplifying the segmentation process. Our key innovation is semantic
descriptors, a new textual representation of segmentation masks where each
image patch is mapped to its corresponding text label. We first introduce
image-wise semantic descriptors, a patch-aligned textual representation of
segmentation masks that integrates naturally into the language modeling
pipeline. To enhance efficiency, we introduce the Row-wise Run-Length Encoding
(R-RLE), which compresses redundant text sequences, reducing the length of
semantic descriptors by 74% and accelerating inference by $3\times$, without
compromising performance. Building upon this, our initial framework Text4Seg
achieves strong segmentation performance across a wide range of vision tasks.
To further improve granularity and compactness, we propose box-wise semantic
descriptors, which localizes regions of interest using bounding boxes and
represents region masks via structured mask tokens called semantic bricks. This
leads to our refined model, Text4Seg++, which formulates segmentation as a
next-brick prediction task, combining precision, scalability, and generative
efficiency. Comprehensive experiments on natural and remote sensing datasets
show that Text4Seg++ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models across
diverse benchmarks without any task-specific fine-tuning, while remaining
compatible with existing MLLM backbones. Our work highlights the effectiveness,
scalability, and generalizability of text-driven image segmentation within the
MLLM framework.

Abstract: The precise characterization of plant morphology provides valuable insights
into plant environment interactions and genetic evolution. A key technology for
extracting this information is 3D segmentation, which delineates individual
plant organs from complex point clouds. Despite significant progress in general
3D computer vision domains, the adoption of 3D segmentation for plant
phenotyping remains limited by three major challenges: i) the scarcity of
large-scale annotated datasets, ii) technical difficulties in adapting advanced
deep neural networks to plant point clouds, and iii) the lack of standardized
benchmarks and evaluation protocols tailored to plant science. This review
systematically addresses these barriers by: i) providing an overview of
existing 3D plant datasets in the context of general 3D segmentation domains,
ii) systematically summarizing deep learning-based methods for point cloud
semantic and instance segmentation, iii) introducing Plant Segmentation Studio
(PSS), an open-source framework for reproducible benchmarking, and iv)
conducting extensive quantitative experiments to evaluate representative
networks and sim-to-real learning strategies. Our findings highlight the
efficacy of sparse convolutional backbones and transformer-based instance
segmentation, while also emphasizing the complementary role of modeling-based
and augmentation-based synthetic data generation for sim-to-real learning in
reducing annotation demands. In general, this study bridges the gap between
algorithmic advances and practical deployment, providing immediate tools for
researchers and a roadmap for developing data-efficient and generalizable deep
learning solutions in 3D plant phenotyping. Data and code are available at

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在复杂视觉环境中性能下降，现有增强方法需要额外训练、依赖外部分割工具或操作粒度较粗，忽视了模型内在的注意力能力。

Method: 分析VLMs注意力模式，发现视觉复杂度与注意力熵相关；提出CARVE方法，通过对比通用查询和任务特定查询的注意力图，在像素级别分解视觉信号为语义信号和视觉噪声。

Result: 广泛实验表明CARVE能持续提升性能，在开源模型上实现高达75%的改进。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了视觉复杂度与注意力机制的相互作用，为通过对比注意力改进视觉推理提供了高效途径。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across
diverse visual tasks, yet their performance degrades in complex visual
environments. While existing enhancement approaches require additional
training, rely on external segmentation tools, or operate at coarse-grained
levels, they overlook the innate ability within VLMs. To bridge this gap, we
investigate VLMs' attention patterns and discover that: (1) visual complexity
strongly correlates with attention entropy, negatively impacting reasoning
performance; (2) attention progressively refines from global scanning in
shallow layers to focused convergence in deeper layers, with convergence degree
determined by visual complexity. (3) Theoretically, we prove that the contrast
of attention maps between general queries and task-specific queries enables the
decomposition of visual signal into semantic signals and visual noise
components. Building on these insights, we propose Contrastive Attention
Refinement for Visual Enhancement (CARVE), a training-free method that extracts
task-relevant visual signals through attention contrasting at the pixel level.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CARVE consistently enhances performance,
achieving up to 75% improvement on open-source models. Our work provides
critical insights into the interplay between visual complexity and attention
mechanisms, offering an efficient pathway for improving visual reasoning with
contrasting attention.

Abstract: Currency recognition systems often overlook usability and authenticity
assessment, especially in low-resource environments where visually impaired
users and offline validation are common. While existing methods focus on
denomination classification, they typically ignore physical degradation and
forgery, limiting their applicability in real-world conditions. This paper
presents a unified framework for currency evaluation that integrates three
modules: denomination classification using lightweight CNN models, damage
quantification through a novel Unified Currency Damage Index (UCDI), and
counterfeit detection using feature-based template matching. The dataset
consists of over 82,000 annotated images spanning clean, damaged, and
counterfeit notes. Our Custom_CNN model achieves high classification
performance with low parameter count. The UCDI metric provides a continuous
usability score based on binary mask loss, chromatic distortion, and structural
feature loss. The counterfeit detection module demonstrates reliable
identification of forged notes across varied imaging conditions. The framework
supports real-time, on-device inference and addresses key deployment challenges
in constrained environments. Results show that accurate, interpretable, and
compact solutions can support inclusive currency evaluation in practical
settings.

Abstract: Vulnerable road users (VRUs) such as pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists
represent more than half of global traffic deaths, yet their detection remains
challenging in poor lighting, adverse weather, and unbalanced data sets. This
paper presents a multimodal detection framework that integrates RGB and thermal
infrared imaging with a fine-tuned YOLOv8 model. Training leveraged KITTI,
BDD100K, and Teledyne FLIR datasets, with class re-weighting and light
augmentations to improve minority-class performance and robustness, experiments
show that 640-pixel resolution and partial backbone freezing optimise accuracy
and efficiency, while class-weighted losses enhance recall for rare VRUs.
Results highlight that thermal models achieve the highest precision, and
RGB-to-thermal augmentation boosts recall, demonstrating the potential of
multimodal detection to improve VRU safety at intersections.

<details>

Motivation: 时间敏感视频理解任务可以从帧中的物体信息中受益，但直接将物体标注作为文本描述添加到提示中会引入额外token长度和对物体级别信息噪声的敏感性。

Method: 提出GO-Tokenizer，一个轻量级的附加模块，利用现成的物体检测器实时编码紧凑的物体信息，作为Video-LLMs的输入。

Result: 实验结果表明，使用GO-Tokenizer进行预训练的模型在推理时间定位和密集字幕等任务上，性能优于原始Video-LLM及其使用文本物体描述的变体，且增益在不同模型、数据集和任务上具有通用性。

Conclusion: GO-Tokenizer通过有效编码物体信息，显著提升了视频大语言模型的时间敏感视频理解能力，为解决物体信息引入的挑战提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We propose to improve the time-sensitive video understanding (TSV) capability
of video large language models (Video-LLMs) with grounded objects (GO). We
hypothesize that TSV tasks can benefit from GO within frames, which is
supported by our preliminary experiments on LITA, a state-of-the-art Video-LLM
for reasoning temporal localization. While augmenting prompts with textual
description of these object annotations improves the performance of LITA, it
also introduces extra token length and susceptibility to the noise in object
level information. To address this, we propose GO-Tokenizer, a lightweight
add-on module for Video-LLMs leveraging off-the-shelf object detectors to
encode compact object information on the fly. Experimental results demonstrate
that pretraining with GO-Tokenizer outperforms the vanilla Video-LLM and its
counterpart utilizing textual description of objects in the prompt. The gain
generalizes across different models, datasets and video understanding tasks
such as reasoning temporal localization and dense captioning.

Method: 重现Luo等人(2024)的实验设置，发现模型描述与原始实现不一致后，提出新实现A-FairCLIP来检验具体设计选择，并扩展出支持多属性的FairCLIP+方法

Result: 在Harvard-FairVLMed数据集上证实了CLIP存在人口统计学偏见，但实验结果并不支持FairCLIP能够改善CLIP的性能和公平性。虽然正则化目标减小了Sinkhorn距离，但既有实现和对齐实现都未在零样本青光眼分类中显示出改善效果

Conclusion: 该研究无法重现FairCLIP的结果，指出原文存在可复现性问题。Sinkhorn距离最小化并不能确保改善CLIP模型的公平性和性能，需要更深入的研究来理解距离最小化与实际公平性改善之间的关系

Abstract: We investigated the reproducibility of FairCLIP, proposed by Luo et al.
(2024), for improving the group fairness of CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) by
minimizing image-text similarity score disparities across sensitive groups
using the Sinkhorn distance. The experimental setup of Luo et al. (2024) was
reproduced to primarily investigate the research findings for FairCLIP. The
model description by Luo et al. (2024) was found to differ from the original
implementation. Therefore, a new implementation, A-FairCLIP, is introduced to
examine specific design choices. Furthermore, FairCLIP+ is proposed to extend
the FairCLIP objective to include multiple attributes. Additionally, the impact
of the distance minimization on FairCLIP's fairness and performance was
explored. In alignment with the original authors, CLIP was found to be biased
towards certain demographics when applied to zero-shot glaucoma classification
using medical scans and clinical notes from the Harvard-FairVLMed dataset.
However, the experimental results on two datasets do not support their claim
that FairCLIP improves the performance and fairness of CLIP. Although the
regularization objective reduces Sinkhorn distances, both the official
implementation and the aligned implementation, A-FairCLIP, were not found to
improve performance nor fairness in zero-shot glaucoma classification.

Abstract: Colorectal diseases, including inflammatory conditions and neoplasms, require
quick, accurate care to be effectively treated. Traditional diagnostic
pipelines require extensive preparation and rely on separate, individual
evaluations on histological images and colonoscopy footage, introducing
possible variability and inefficiencies. This pilot study proposes a unified
deep learning network that uses convolutional neural networks (CN N s) to
classify both histopathological slides and colonoscopy video frames in one
pipeline. The pipeline integrates class-balancing learning, robust
augmentation, and calibration methods to ensure accurate results. Static colon
histology images were taken from the PathMNIST dataset, and the lower
gastrointestinal (colonoscopy) videos were drawn from the HyperKvasir dataset.
The CNN architecture used was ResNet-50. This study demonstrates an
interpretable and reproducible diagnostic pipeline that unifies multiple
diagnostic modalities to advance and ease the detection of colorectal diseases.

TL;DR: 使用CNN-LSTM混合深度学习模型，通过四种成像模态和时间序列数据，在复合压力环境下准确识别氮素压力严重程度，达到98%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 植物在自然生境中面临多种交互压力，氮素缺乏在干旱和杂草竞争的复合压力下更难识别。早期检测氮素压力对保护植物健康和实施有效管理策略至关重要。

Method: 提出一种新题深度学习框架，使用RGB、多谱和两种红外波长四种成像模态获取植物生理响应。核心方法是空间-时间深度学习流水线，结合CNN提取空间特征和LSTM网络捕捉时间依赖关系。还设计了单纯空间CNN流水线进行对比。

Conclusion: 该稳健平台为及时和主动识别氮素压力严重程度提供了有前景的工具，能够实现更好的作物管理和改善植物健康。

Abstract: Plants in their natural habitats endure an array of interacting stresses,
both biotic and abiotic, that rarely occur in isolation. Nutrient
stress-particularly nitrogen deficiency-becomes even more critical when
compounded with drought and weed competition, making it increasingly difficult
to distinguish and address its effects. Early detection of nitrogen stress is
therefore crucial for protecting plant health and implementing effective
management strategies. This study proposes a novel deep learning framework to
accurately classify nitrogen stress severity in a combined stress environment.
Our model uses a unique blend of four imaging modalities-RGB, multispectral,
and two infrared wavelengths-to capture a wide range of physiological plant
responses from canopy images. These images, provided as time-series data,
document plant health across three levels of nitrogen availability (low,
medium, and high) under varying water stress and weed pressures. The core of
our approach is a spatio-temporal deep learning pipeline that merges a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for extracting spatial features from images
with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture temporal dependencies.
We also devised and evaluated a spatial-only CNN pipeline for comparison. Our
CNN-LSTM pipeline achieved an impressive accuracy of 98%, impressively
surpassing the spatial-only model's 80.45% and other previously reported
machine learning method's 76%. These results bring actionable insights based on
the power of our CNN-LSTM approach in effectively capturing the subtle and
complex interactions between nitrogen deficiency, water stress, and weed
pressure. This robust platform offers a promising tool for the timely and
proactive identification of nitrogen stress severity, enabling better crop
management and improved plant health.

Method: 构建了包含787张RGB图片的手动标注数据集，提出BioLite U-Net模型，采用深度分离卷积来大幅减少计算量，在Raspberry Pi 4B上进行实际部署测试。

Result: BioLite U-Net达到了92.85%的mIoU和96.17%的Dice分数，模型大小比MobileNetV2-DeepLabV3+小1300倍，每帧推理时间仅335ms，实现了几乎实时的性能。

Conclusion: BioLite U-Net在分割准确性、效率和部署性方面完胜传统轻量级模型，适合集成到智能闭环生物打印系统中。

Abstract: Bioprinting is a rapidly advancing field that offers a transformative
approach to fabricating tissue and organ models through the precise deposition
of cell-laden bioinks. Ensuring the fidelity and consistency of printed
structures in real-time remains a core challenge, particularly under
constraints imposed by limited imaging data and resource-constrained embedded
hardware. Semantic segmentation of the extrusion process, differentiating
between nozzle, extruded bioink, and surrounding background, enables in situ
monitoring critical to maintaining print quality and biological viability. In
this work, we introduce a lightweight semantic segmentation framework tailored
for real-time bioprinting applications. We present a novel, manually annotated
dataset comprising 787 RGB images captured during the bioprinting process,
labeled across three classes: nozzle, bioink, and background. To achieve fast
and efficient inference suitable for integration with bioprinting systems, we
propose a BioLite U-Net architecture that leverages depthwise separable
convolutions to drastically reduce computational load without compromising
accuracy. Our model is benchmarked against MobileNetV2 and MobileNetV3-based
segmentation baselines using mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), Dice score,
and pixel accuracy. All models were evaluated on a Raspberry Pi 4B to assess
real-world feasibility. The proposed BioLite U-Net achieves an mIoU of 92.85%
and a Dice score of 96.17%, while being over 1300x smaller than
MobileNetV2-DeepLabV3+. On-device inference takes 335 ms per frame,
demonstrating near real-time capability. Compared to MobileNet baselines,
BioLite U-Net offers a superior tradeoff between segmentation accuracy,
efficiency, and deployability, making it highly suitable for intelligent,
closed-loop bioprinting systems.

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR),
traditional models often struggle to generalize across varying scale factors,
limiting their real-world applicability. To address this, we propose a plug-in
Scale-Aware Attention Module (SAAM) designed to retrofit modern fixed-scale SR
models with the ability to perform arbitrary-scale SR. SAAM employs
lightweight, scale-adaptive feature extraction and upsampling, incorporating
the Simple parameter-free Attention Module (SimAM) for efficient guidance and
gradient variance loss to enhance sharpness in image details. Our method
integrates seamlessly into multiple state-of-the-art SR backbones (e.g., SCNet,
HiT-SR, OverNet), delivering competitive or superior performance across a wide
range of integer and non-integer scale factors. Extensive experiments on
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach enables robust multi-scale
upscaling with minimal computational overhead, offering a practical solution
for real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Brain tumors are serious health problems that require early diagnosis due to
their high mortality rates. Diagnosing tumors by examining Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) images is a process that requires expertise and is prone to
error. Therefore, the need for automated diagnosis systems is increasing day by
day. In this context, a robust and explainable Deep Learning (DL) model for the
classification of brain tumors is proposed. In this study, a publicly available
Figshare dataset containing 3,064 T1-weighted contrast-enhanced brain MRI
images of three tumor types was used. First, the classification performance of
nine well-known CNN architectures was evaluated to determine the most effective
backbone. Among these, EfficientNetV2 demonstrated the best performance and was
selected as the backbone for further development. Subsequently, an
attention-based MLP-Mixer architecture was integrated into EfficientNetV2 to
enhance its classification capability. The performance of the final model was
comprehensively compared with basic CNNs and the methods in the literature.
Additionally, Grad-CAM visualization was used to interpret and validate the
decision-making process of the proposed model. The proposed model's performance
was evaluated using the five-fold cross-validation method. The proposed model
demonstrated superior performance with 99.50% accuracy, 99.47% precision,
99.52% recall and 99.49% F1 score. The results obtained show that the model
outperforms the studies in the literature. Moreover, Grad-CAM visualizations
demonstrate that the model effectively focuses on relevant regions of MRI
images, thus improving interpretability and clinical reliability. A robust deep
learning model for clinical decision support systems has been obtained by
combining EfficientNetV2 and attention-based MLP-Mixer, providing high accuracy
and interpretability in brain tumor classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑转移瘤是癌症死亡的主要原因之一，但纵向MRI图像分析工作量过大，临床医生很难完成详细注释和分析，需要自动化工具来提高评估精度和预测治疗效果。

Method: 建立了一个自动化数据处理管道，收集了177名患者的896个脑转移瘤的长期跟踪数据。采用数据驱动聚类方法识别脱病变化轨迹，并使用梯度提升和图机器学习方法进行12个月响应预测。

Result: 聚类分析发现了5种主要的脱病变化轨迹，每种轨迹有明显不同的最终响应类别。梯度提升方法在仅使用治前和第一次跟踪MRI数据的情况下达到0.90 AUC的预测性能，图机器学习方法也达到0.88 AUC的稳健性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为脑转移瘤SRS治疗的纵向MRI评估提供了潜在的自动化和精准化方案，为临床决策支持系统的开发奠定了基础，有助于优化个性化调护方案。

Abstract: Brain Metastases (BM) are a large contributor to mortality of patients with
cancer. They are treated with Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) and monitored
with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) at regular follow-up intervals according
to treatment guidelines. Analyzing and quantifying this longitudinal imaging
represents an intractable workload for clinicians. As a result, follow-up
images are not annotated and merely assessed by observation. Response to
treatment in longitudinal imaging is being studied, to better understand growth
trajectories and ultimately predict treatment success or toxicity as early as
possible. In this study, we implement an automated pipeline to curate a large
longitudinal dataset of SRS treatment data, resulting in a cohort of 896 BMs in
177 patients who were monitored for >360 days at approximately two-month
intervals at Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV). We use a data-driven
clustering to identify characteristic trajectories. In addition, we predict 12
months lesion-level response using classical as well as graph machine learning
Graph Machine Learning (GML). Clustering revealed 5 dominant growth
trajectories with distinct final response categories. Response prediction
reaches up to 0.90 AUC (CI95%=0.88-0.92) using only pre-treatment and first
follow-up MRI with gradient boosting. Similarly, robust predictive performance
of up to 0.88 AUC (CI95%=0.86-0.90) was obtained using GML, offering more
flexibility with a single model for multiple input time-points configurations.
Our results suggest potential automation and increased precision for the
comprehensive assessment and prediction of BM response to SRS in longitudinal
MRI. The proposed pipeline facilitates scalable data curation for the
investigation of BM growth patterns, and lays the foundation for clinical
decision support systems aiming at optimizing personalized care.

Conclusion: 基于球坐标的量化方案能够有效降低3DoF+场景下的投影误差，提高3D高斯泼溅在受限自由度场景中的重建质量

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a major breakthrough in 3D scene
reconstruction. With a number of views of a given object or scene, the
algorithm trains a model composed of 3D gaussians, which enables the production
of novel views from arbitrary points of view. This freedom of movement is
referred to as 6DoF for 6 degrees of freedom: a view is produced for any
position (3 degrees), orientation of camera (3 other degrees). On large scenes,
though, the input views are acquired from a limited zone in space, and the
reconstruction is valuable for novel views from the same zone, even if the
scene itself is almost unlimited in size. We refer to this particular case as
3DoF+, meaning that the 3 degrees of freedom of camera position are limited to
small offsets around the central position. Considering the problem of
coordinate quantization, the impact of position error on the projection error
in pixels is studied. It is shown that the projection error is proportional to
the squared inverse distance of the point being projected. Consequently, a new
quantization scheme based on spherical coordinates is proposed. Rate-distortion
performance of the proposed method are illustrated on the well-known Garden
scene.

Abstract: Assessing the severity of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) using the Total Sharp/Van
Der Heijde Score (TSS) is crucial, but manual scoring is often time-consuming
and subjective. This study introduces an Automated Radiographic Sharp Scoring
(ARTSS) framework that leverages deep learning to analyze full-hand X-ray
images, aiming to reduce inter- and intra-observer variability. The research
uniquely accommodates patients with joint disappearance and variable-length
image sequences. We developed ARTSS using data from 970 patients, structured
into four stages: I) Image pre-processing and re-orientation using ResNet50,
II) Hand segmentation using UNet.3, III) Joint identification using YOLOv7, and
IV) TSS prediction using models such as VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, DenseNet201,
EfficientNetB0, and Vision Transformer (ViT). We evaluated model performance
with Intersection over Union (IoU), Mean Average Precision (MAP), mean absolute
error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Huber loss. The average TSS
from two radiologists was used as the ground truth. Model training employed
3-fold cross-validation, with each fold consisting of 452 training and 227
validation samples, and external testing included 291 unseen subjects. Our
joint identification model achieved 99% accuracy. The best-performing model,
ViT, achieved a notably low Huber loss of 0.87 for TSS prediction. Our results
demonstrate the potential of deep learning to automate RA scoring, which can
significantly enhance clinical practice. Our approach addresses the challenge
of joint disappearance and variable joint numbers, offers timesaving benefits,
reduces inter- and intra-reader variability, improves radiologist accuracy, and
aids rheumatologists in making more informed decisions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VCOD方法存在两个主要问题：(1)SAM方法由于模型冻结难以分离伪装目标边缘；(2)MLLM方法因大语言模型合并前景和背景而导致目标分离性差。需要开发新方法来同时解决边缘细节分离和目标-背景分离问题。

Conclusion: Phantom-Insight通过结合SAM和MLLM的优势，并引入创新的特征融合和解耦学习策略，有效解决了视频伪装目标检测中的边缘分离和目标-背景分离问题，展现出优异的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Video camouflaged object detection (VCOD) is challenging due to dynamic
environments. Existing methods face two main issues: (1) SAM-based methods
struggle to separate camouflaged object edges due to model freezing, and (2)
MLLM-based methods suffer from poor object separability as large language
models merge foreground and background. To address these issues, we propose a
novel VCOD method based on SAM and MLLM, called Phantom-Insight. To enhance the
separability of object edge details, we represent video sequences with temporal
and spatial clues and perform feature fusion via LLM to increase information
density. Next, multiple cues are generated through the dynamic foreground
visual token scoring module and the prompt network to adaptively guide and
fine-tune the SAM model, enabling it to adapt to subtle textures. To enhance
the separability of objects and background, we propose a decoupled
foreground-background learning strategy. By generating foreground and
background cues separately and performing decoupled training, the visual token
can effectively integrate foreground and background information independently,
enabling SAM to more accurately segment camouflaged objects in the video.
Experiments on the MoCA-Mask dataset show that Phantom-Insight achieves
state-of-the-art performance across various metrics. Additionally, its ability
to detect unseen camouflaged objects on the CAD2016 dataset highlights its
strong generalization ability.

Abstract: Muzzle patterns are among the most effective biometric traits for cattle
identification. Fast and accurate detection of the muzzle region as the region
of interest is critical to automatic visual cattle identification.. Earlier
approaches relied on manual detection, which is labor-intensive and
inconsistent. Recently, automated methods using supervised models like YOLO
have become popular for muzzle detection. Although effective, these methods
require extensive annotated datasets and tend to be trained data-dependent,
limiting their performance on new or unseen cattle. To address these
limitations, this study proposes a zero-shot muzzle detection framework based
on Grounding DINO, a vision-language model capable of detecting muzzles without
any task-specific training or annotated data. This approach leverages natural
language prompts to guide detection, enabling scalable and flexible muzzle
localization across diverse breeds and environments. Our model achieves a mean
Average Precision (mAP)@0.5 of 76.8\%, demonstrating promising performance
without requiring annotated data. To our knowledge, this is the first research
to provide a real-world, industry-oriented, and annotation-free solution for
cattle muzzle detection. The framework offers a practical alternative to
supervised methods, promising improved adaptability and ease of deployment in
livestock monitoring applications.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a critical task in clinical workflows,
particularly for the detection and delineation of pathological regions. While
convolutional architectures like U-Net have become standard for such tasks,
their limited receptive field restricts global context modeling. Recent efforts
integrating transformers have addressed this, but often result in deep,
computationally expensive models unsuitable for real-time use. In this work, we
present a novel end-to-end lightweight architecture designed specifically for
real-time binary medical image segmentation. Our model combines a Swin
Transformer-like encoder with a U-Net-like decoder, connected via skip pathways
to preserve spatial detail while capturing contextual information. Unlike
existing designs such as Swin Transformer or U-Net, our architecture is
significantly shallower and competitively efficient. To improve the encoder's
ability to learn meaningful features without relying on large amounts of
labeled data, we first train it using Barlow Twins, a self-supervised learning
method that helps the model focus on important patterns by reducing unnecessary
repetition in the learned features. After this pretraining, we fine-tune the
entire model for our specific task. Experiments on benchmark binary
segmentation tasks demonstrate that our model achieves competitive accuracy
with substantially reduced parameter count and faster inference, positioning it
as a practical alternative for deployment in real-time and resource-limited
clinical environments. The code for our method is available at Github

Abstract: Many super-resolution (SR) algorithms have been proposed to increase image
resolution. However, full-reference (FR) image quality assessment (IQA) metrics
for comparing and evaluating different SR algorithms are limited. In this work,
we propose the Perception-oriented Bidirectional Attention Network (PBAN) for
image SR FR-IQA, which is composed of three modules: an image encoder module, a
perception-oriented bidirectional attention (PBA) module, and a quality
prediction module. First, we encode the input images for feature
representations. Inspired by the characteristics of the human visual system, we
then construct the perception-oriented PBA module. Specifically, different from
existing attention-based SR IQA methods, we conceive a Bidirectional Attention
to bidirectionally construct visual attention to distortion, which is
consistent with the generation and evaluation processes of SR images. To
further guide the quality assessment towards the perception of distorted
information, we propose Grouped Multi-scale Deformable Convolution, enabling
the proposed method to adaptively perceive distortion. Moreover, we design
Sub-information Excitation Convolution to direct visual perception to both
sub-pixel and sub-channel attention. Finally, the quality prediction module is
exploited to integrate quality-aware features and regress quality scores.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed PBAN outperforms
state-of-the-art quality assessment methods.

Abstract: Cross-source point cloud registration, which aims to align point cloud data
from different sensors, is a fundamental task in 3D vision. However, compared
to the same-source point cloud registration, cross-source registration faces
two core challenges: the lack of publicly available large-scale real-world
datasets for training the deep registration models, and the inherent
differences in point clouds captured by multiple sensors. The diverse patterns
induced by the sensors pose great challenges in robust and accurate point cloud
feature extraction and matching, which negatively influence the registration
accuracy. To advance research in this field, we construct Cross3DReg, the
currently largest and real-world multi-modal cross-source point cloud
registration dataset, which is collected by a rotating mechanical lidar and a
hybrid semi-solid-state lidar, respectively. Moreover, we design an
overlap-based cross-source registration framework, which utilizes unaligned
images to predict the overlapping region between source and target point
clouds, effectively filtering out redundant points in the irrelevant regions
and significantly mitigating the interference caused by noise in
non-overlapping areas. Then, a visual-geometric attention guided matching
module is proposed to enhance the consistency of cross-source point cloud
features by fusing image and geometric information to establish reliable
correspondences and ultimately achieve accurate and robust registration.
Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
registration performance. Our framework reduces the relative rotation error
(RRE) and relative translation error (RTE) by $63.2\%$ and $40.2\%$,
respectively, and improves the registration recall (RR) by $5.4\%$, which
validates its effectiveness in achieving accurate cross-source registration.

Conclusion: 保持完整姿态序列是不必要的，少量代表性帧的姿态token即可实现高效率和准确度，该方法具有通用性和实用性

Abstract: Transformers have been successfully applied in the field of video-based 3D
human pose estimation. However, the high computational costs of these video
pose transformers (VPTs) make them impractical on resource-constrained devices.
In this paper, we present a hierarchical plug-and-play pruning-and-recovering
framework, called Hierarchical Hourglass Tokenizer (H$_{2}$OT), for efficient
transformer-based 3D human pose estimation from videos. H$_{2}$OT begins with
progressively pruning pose tokens of redundant frames and ends with recovering
full-length sequences, resulting in a few pose tokens in the intermediate
transformer blocks and thus improving the model efficiency. It works with two
key modules, namely, a Token Pruning Module (TPM) and a Token Recovering Module
(TRM). TPM dynamically selects a few representative tokens to eliminate the
redundancy of video frames, while TRM restores the detailed spatio-temporal
information based on the selected tokens, thereby expanding the network output
to the original full-length temporal resolution for fast inference. Our method
is general-purpose: it can be easily incorporated into common VPT models on
both seq2seq and seq2frame pipelines while effectively accommodating different
token pruning and recovery strategies. In addition, our H$_{2}$OT reveals that
maintaining the full pose sequence is unnecessary, and a few pose tokens of
representative frames can achieve both high efficiency and estimation accuracy.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate both the
effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. Code and models are

Abstract: Deep neural networks currently dominate many fields of the artificial
intelligence landscape, achieving state-of-the-art results on numerous tasks
while remaining hard to understand and exhibiting surprising weaknesses. An
active area of research focuses on adversarial attacks, which aim to generate
inputs that uncover these weaknesses. However, this proves challenging,
especially in the black-box scenario where model details are inaccessible. This
paper explores in detail the impact of such adversarial algorithms on
ResNet-18, DenseNet-121, Swin Transformer V2, and Vision Transformer network
architectures. Leveraging the Tiny ImageNet, Caltech-256, and Food-101
datasets, we benchmark two novel black-box iterative adversarial algorithms
based on affine transformations and genetic algorithms: 1) Affine
Transformation Attack (ATA), an iterative algorithm maximizing our attack score
function using random affine transformations, and 2) Affine Genetic Attack
(AGA), a genetic algorithm that involves random noise and affine
transformations. We evaluate the performance of the models in the algorithm
parameter variation, data augmentation, and global and targeted attack
configurations. We also compare our algorithms with two black-box adversarial
algorithms, Pixle and Square Attack. Our experiments yield better results on
the image classification task than similar methods in the literature, achieving
an accuracy improvement of up to 8.82%. We provide noteworthy insights into
successful adversarial defenses and attacks at both global and targeted levels,
and demonstrate adversarial robustness through algorithm parameter variation.

Abstract: Realistic and parameterized 3D models of human anatomy have become invaluable
in research, diagnostics, and surgical planning. However, the development of
detailed models for internal organs, such as the stomach, has been limited by
data availability and methodological challenges. In this paper, we propose a
novel pipeline for the generation of synthetic 3D stomach models, enabling the
creation of anatomically diverse morphologies informed by established studies
on stomach shape variability. Using this pipeline, we construct a dataset of
synthetic stomachs. Building on this dataset, we develop a 3D statistical shape
model of the stomach, trained to capture natural anatomical variability in a
low-dimensional shape space. The model is further refined using CT meshes
derived from publicly available datasets through a semi-supervised alignment
process, enhancing its ability to generalize to unseen anatomical variations.
We evaluated the model on a held-out test set of real stomach CT scans,
demonstrating robust generalization and fit accuracy. We make the statistical
shape model along with the synthetic dataset publicly available on GitLab:
https://gitlab.com/Erez.Posner/stomach_pytorch to facilitate further research.
This work introduces the first statistical 3D shape model of the stomach, with
applications ranging from surgical simulation and pre-operative planning to
medical education and computational modeling. By combining synthetic data
generation, parametric modeling, and real-world validation, our approach
represents a significant advancement in organ modeling and opens new
possibilities for personalized healthcare solutions.

Abstract: The advent of large-scale vision foundation models, pre-trained on diverse
natural images, has marked a paradigm shift in computer vision. However, how
the frontier vision foundation models' efficacies transfer to specialized
domains remains such as medical imaging remains an open question. This report
investigates whether DINOv3, a state-of-the-art self-supervised vision
transformer (ViT) that features strong capability in dense prediction tasks,
can directly serve as a powerful, unified encoder for medical vision tasks
without domain-specific pre-training. To answer this, we benchmark DINOv3
across common medical vision tasks, including 2D/3D classification and
segmentation on a wide range of medical imaging modalities. We systematically
analyze its scalability by varying model sizes and input image resolutions. Our
findings reveal that DINOv3 shows impressive performance and establishes a
formidable new baseline. Remarkably, it can even outperform medical-specific
foundation models like BiomedCLIP and CT-Net on several tasks, despite being
trained solely on natural images. However, we identify clear limitations: The
model's features degrade in scenarios requiring deep domain specialization,
such as in Whole-Slide Pathological Images (WSIs), Electron Microscopy (EM),
and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Furthermore, we observe that DINOv3
does not consistently obey scaling law in the medical domain; performance does
not reliably increase with larger models or finer feature resolutions, showing
diverse scaling behaviors across tasks. Ultimately, our work establishes DINOv3
as a strong baseline, whose powerful visual features can serve as a robust
prior for multiple complex medical tasks. This opens promising future
directions, such as leveraging its features to enforce multiview consistency in
3D reconstruction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率遥感图像变化检测面临两个关键挑战：1）模型容易将时间偏移（如光照、季节变化）引起的辐射变化误判为真实变化；2）深层抽象特征与浅层细节特征之间存在语义鸿沟，导致边界分割不准确。

Method: 提出FSG-Net网络：1）在频域使用差异感知小波交互模块（DAWIM）自适应处理不同频率分量，减少伪变化；2）在空间域使用协同时空注意力模块（STSAM）增强真实变化区域的显著性；3）使用轻量级门控融合单元（LGFU）利用高层语义选择性地门控和整合浅层关键细节。

Conclusion: FSG-Net通过频域和空间域的协同处理，有效解决了遥感图像变化检测中的伪变化问题和语义鸿沟问题，显著提升了变化检测的性能和边界分割质量。

Abstract: Change detection from high-resolution remote sensing images lies as a
cornerstone of Earth observation applications, yet its efficacy is often
compromised by two critical challenges. First, false alarms are prevalent as
models misinterpret radiometric variations from temporal shifts (e.g.,
illumination, season) as genuine changes. Second, a non-negligible semantic gap
between deep abstract features and shallow detail-rich features tends to
obstruct their effective fusion, culminating in poorly delineated boundaries.
To step further in addressing these issues, we propose the Frequency-Spatial
Synergistic Gated Network (FSG-Net), a novel paradigm that aims to
systematically disentangle semantic changes from nuisance variations.
Specifically, FSG-Net first operates in the frequency domain, where a
Discrepancy-Aware Wavelet Interaction Module (DAWIM) adaptively mitigates
pseudo-changes by discerningly processing different frequency components.
Subsequently, the refined features are enhanced in the spatial domain by a
Synergistic Temporal-Spatial Attention Module (STSAM), which amplifies the
saliency of genuine change regions. To finally bridge the semantic gap, a
Lightweight Gated Fusion Unit (LGFU) leverages high-level semantics to
selectively gate and integrate crucial details from shallow layers.
Comprehensive experiments on the CDD, GZ-CD, and LEVIR-CD benchmarks validate
the superiority of FSG-Net, establishing a new state-of-the-art with F1-scores
of 94.16%, 89.51%, and 91.27%, respectively. The code will be made available at
https://github.com/zxXie-Air/FSG-Net after a possible publication.

Abstract: In industrial quality control, to visually recognize unwanted items within a
moving heterogeneous stream, human operators are often still indispensable.
Waste-sorting stands as a significant example, where operators on multiple
conveyor belts manually remove unwanted objects to select specific materials.
To automate this recognition problem, computer vision systems offer great
potential in accurately identifying and segmenting unwanted items in such
settings. Unfortunately, considering the multitude and the variety of sorting
tasks, fully supervised approaches are not a viable option to address this
challange, as they require extensive labeling efforts. Surprisingly, weakly
supervised alternatives that leverage the implicit supervision naturally
provided by the operator in his removal action are relatively unexplored. In
this paper, we define the concept of Before-After Supervision, illustrating how
to train a segmentation network by leveraging only the visual differences
between images acquired \textit{before} and \textit{after} the operator. To
promote research in this direction, we introduce WS$^2$ (Weakly Supervised
segmentation for Waste-Sorting), the first multiview dataset consisting of more
than 11 000 high-resolution video frames captured on top of a conveyor belt,
including "before" and "after" images. We also present a robust end-to-end
pipeline, used to benchmark several state-of-the-art weakly supervised
segmentation methods on WS$^2$.

Abstract: Subject-driven image generation (SDIG) aims to manipulate specific subjects
within images while adhering to textual instructions, a task crucial for
advancing text-to-image diffusion models. SDIG requires reconciling the tension
between maintaining subject identity and complying with dynamic edit
instructions, a challenge inadequately addressed by existing methods. In this
paper, we introduce the Target-Instructed Diffusion Enhancing (TIDE) framework,
which resolves this tension through target supervision and preference learning
without test-time fine-tuning. TIDE pioneers target-supervised triplet
alignment, modelling subject adaptation dynamics using a (reference image,
instruction, target images) triplet. This approach leverages the Direct Subject
Diffusion (DSD) objective, training the model with paired "winning" (balanced
preservation-compliance) and "losing" (distorted) targets, systematically
generated and evaluated via quantitative metrics. This enables implicit reward
modelling for optimal preservation-compliance balance. Experimental results on
standard benchmarks demonstrate TIDE's superior performance in generating
subject-faithful outputs while maintaining instruction compliance,
outperforming baseline methods across multiple quantitative metrics. TIDE's
versatility is further evidenced by its successful application to diverse
tasks, including structural-conditioned generation, image-to-image generation,
and text-image interpolation. Our code is available at

Abstract: Accurate evaluation of the response of glioblastoma to therapy is crucial for
clinical decision-making and patient management. The Response Assessment in
Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria provide a standardized framework to assess
patients' clinical response, but their application can be complex and subject
to observer variability. This paper presents an automated method for
classifying the intervention response from longitudinal MRI scans, developed to
predict tumor response during therapy as part of the BraTS 2025 challenge. We
propose a novel hybrid framework that combines deep learning derived feature
extraction and an extensive set of radiomics and clinically chosen features.
Our approach utilizes a fine-tuned ResNet-18 model to extract features from 2D
regions of interest across four MRI modalities. These deep features are then
fused with a rich set of more than 4800 radiomic and clinically driven
features, including 3D radiomics of tumor growth and shrinkage masks,
volumetric changes relative to the nadir, and tumor centroid shift. Using the
fused feature set, a CatBoost classifier achieves a mean ROC AUC of 0.81 and a
Macro F1 score of 0.50 in the 4-class response prediction task (Complete
Response, Partial Response, Stable Disease, Progressive Disease). Our results
highlight that synergizing learned image representations with domain-targeted
radiomic features provides a robust and effective solution for automated
treatment response assessment in neuro-oncology.

allowing FMOX to be accessible and usable for other machine learning pipelines
aiming to process FMO datasets.

Conclusion: 强调了训练设计在跨模态检索任务中的关键作用，并指出需要改进场景级SBIR的评估场景。

Abstract: The goal of Scene-level Sketch-Based Image Retrieval is to retrieve natural
images matching the overall semantics and spatial layout of a free-hand sketch.
Unlike prior work focused on architectural augmentations of retrieval models,
we emphasize the inherent ambiguity and noise present in real-world sketches.
This insight motivates a training objective that is explicitly designed to be
robust to sketch variability. We show that with an appropriate combination of
pre-training, encoder architecture, and loss formulation, it is possible to
achieve state-of-the-art performance without the introduction of additional
complexity. Extensive experiments on a challenging FS-COCO and widely-used
SketchyCOCO datasets confirm the effectiveness of our approach and underline

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了RARL方法来解决增量开集识别(IOSR)中的问题，通过角度空间对齐和虚拟类交互训练，有效缓解了知识更新过程中的表征偏移和类间混淆问题。


<details>

Motivation: 现有开集识别方法主要面向静态场景，而真实场景中模型需要从连续数据流中增量识别新的未知类别并学习相应知识，这导致了严重的类间混淆问题。

Method: 提出了保持性角度表征学习(RARL)方法，包括：1)在等角紧架构造的角度空间中将未知表征对齐到非活跃原型；2)虚拟-内在交互(VII)训练策略，通过边界近伺虚拟类来压缩已知表征；3)层化校正策略来精炼决策边界。

Result: 在CIFAR100和TinyImageNet数据集上进行了全面评估，并为IOSR建立了新的标杆。在各种任务设置下的实验结果显示，该方法达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: RARL方法通过角度空间表征学习和虚拟类交互训练，有效解决了增量开集识别中的表征偏移和类间混淆问题，为该领域提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing open set recognition (OSR) methods are typically designed for static
scenarios, where models aim to classify known classes and identify unknown ones
within fixed scopes. This deviates from the expectation that the model should
incrementally identify newly emerging unknown classes from continuous data
streams and acquire corresponding knowledge. In such evolving scenarios, the
discriminability of OSR decision boundaries is hard to maintain due to
restricted access to former training data, causing severe inter-class
confusion. To solve this problem, we propose retentive angular representation
learning (RARL) for incremental open set recognition (IOSR). In RARL, unknown
representations are encouraged to align around inactive prototypes within an
angular space constructed under the equiangular tight frame, thereby mitigating
excessive representation drift during knowledge updates. Specifically, we adopt
a virtual-intrinsic interactive (VII) training strategy, which compacts known
representations by enforcing clear inter-class margins through
boundary-proximal virtual classes. Furthermore, a stratified rectification
strategy is designed to refine decision boundaries, mitigating representation
bias and feature space distortion caused by imbalances between old/new and
positive/negative class samples. We conduct thorough evaluations on CIFAR100
and TinyImageNet datasets and establish a new benchmark for IOSR. Experimental
results across various task setups demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Mathematical morphology provides a nonlinear framework for image and spatial
data processing and analysis. Although there have been many successful
applications of mathematical morphology to vector-valued images, such as color
and hyperspectral images, there is still no consensus on the most suitable
vector ordering for constructing morphological operators. This paper addresses
this issue by examining a reduced ordering approximating the Condorcet ranking
derived from a set of vector orderings. Inspired by voting problems, the
Condorcet ordering ranks elements from most to least voted, with voters
representing different orderings. In this paper, we develop a machine learning
approach that learns a reduced ordering that approximates the Condorcet
ordering. Preliminary computational experiments confirm the effectiveness of
learning the reduced mapping to define vector-valued morphological operators
for color images.

Conclusion: CausNVS通过自回归方法成功解决了多视角扩散模型的限制，为3D新视角合成提供了更灵活高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-view diffusion models have shown promise in 3D novel view synthesis,
but most existing methods adopt a non-autoregressive formulation. This limits
their applicability in world modeling, as they only support a fixed number of
views and suffer from slow inference due to denoising all frames
simultaneously. To address these limitations, we propose CausNVS, a multi-view
diffusion model in an autoregressive setting, which supports arbitrary
input-output view configurations and generates views sequentially. We train
CausNVS with causal masking and per-frame noise, using pairwise-relative camera
pose encodings (CaPE) for precise camera control. At inference time, we combine
a spatially-aware sliding-window with key-value caching and noise conditioning
augmentation to mitigate drift. Our experiments demonstrate that CausNVS
supports a broad range of camera trajectories, enables flexible autoregressive
novel view synthesis, and achieves consistently strong visual quality across
diverse settings. Project page: https://kxhit.github.io/CausNVS.html.

Motivation: 数字市场和社交媒体上的不可持续野生动物贸易对生物多样性构成严重威胁，需要自动化方法来处理巨量的数字内容

Method: 开发机器学习对象识别模型，使用象牙、黑狼牙、虎等被罕贸或没收的野生动物产品图片进行训练，研究了不同的训练策略和损失函数组合

Abstract: Unsustainable trade in wildlife is a major threat to biodiversity and is now
increasingly prevalent in digital marketplaces and social media. With the sheer
volume of digital content, the need for automated methods to detect wildlife
trade listings is growing. These methods are especially needed for the
automatic identification of wildlife products, such as ivory. We developed
machine learning-based object recognition models that can identify wildlife
products within images and highlight them. The data consists of images of
elephant, pangolin, and tiger products that were identified as being sold
illegally or that were confiscated by authorities. Specifically, the wildlife
products included elephant ivory and skins, pangolin scales, and claws (raw and
crafted), and tiger skins and bones. We investigated various combinations of
training strategies and two loss functions to identify the best model to use in
the automatic detection of these wildlife products. Models were trained for
each species while also developing a single model to identify products from all
three species. The best model showed an overall accuracy of 84.2% with
accuracies of 71.1%, 90.2% and 93.5% in detecting products derived from
elephants, pangolins, and tigers, respectively. We further demonstrate that the
machine learning model can be made easily available to stakeholders, such as
government authorities and law enforcement agencies, by developing a
smartphone-based application that had an overall accuracy of 91.3%. The
application can be used in real time to click images and help identify
potentially prohibited products of target species. Thus, the proposed method is
not only applicable for monitoring trade on the web but can also be used e.g.
in physical markets for monitoring wildlife trade.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低剂量CT和PET虽然减少辐射暴露，但会导致噪声和伪影增加，影响诊断准确性，因此需要有效的去噪方法。

Method: 提出HSANet网络，包含高效全局注意力(EGA)模块增强空间和通道交互，以及混合上采样模块防止噪声过拟合。

Result: 在公开LDCT/PET数据集上实验证明，HSANet相比现有方法具有更优的去噪性能，同时保持轻量级模型大小。

Conclusion: 该方法在标准GPU内存配置下可部署，具有很高的实际临床应用价值。

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) and positron emission tomography (PET)
have emerged as safer alternatives to conventional imaging modalities by
significantly reducing radiation exposure. However, this reduction often
results in increased noise and artifacts, which can compromise diagnostic
accuracy. Consequently, denoising for LDCT/PET has become a vital area of
research aimed at enhancing image quality while maintaining radiation safety.
In this study, we introduce a novel Hybrid Swin Attention Network (HSANet),
which incorporates Efficient Global Attention (EGA) modules and a hybrid
upsampling module. The EGA modules enhance both spatial and channel-wise
interaction, improving the network's capacity to capture relevant features,
while the hybrid upsampling module mitigates the risk of overfitting to noise.
We validate the proposed approach using a publicly available LDCT/PET dataset.
Experimental results demonstrate that HSANet achieves superior denoising
performance compared to existing methods, while maintaining a lightweight model
size suitable for deployment on GPUs with standard memory configurations. This
makes our approach highly practical for real-world clinical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高速量解释机器人采集的海底视觉图像可提高海洋监测和探索效率。虽然最近研究已经说明位置元数据可以增强自监督学习特征，但其在不同SSL策略、模型和海底图像数据集上的好处仍然很少被探索。

Method: 评估位置基于正则化对六种先进SSL框架的影响，包括卷积神经网络(CNN)和视觉Transformer(ViT)模型，以及不同隐藏空间维度。在三个多样化的海底图像数据集上进行了评估。

Result: 位置正则化一质地提高了下游分类性能，CNN模型F1分数平均提升4.9±4.0%，ViT模型提升6.3±8.9%。高维隐藏表征对CNN有益，而数据集优化的SSL在高低维度表征上表现相似。位置正则化SSL在高低维度表征上分别比预训练模型提升2.7±2.7%和10.1±9.4%。

Conclusion: 研究结果突出了位置元数据对SSL正则化的价值，尤其是在使用低维隐藏表征时，并证明了高维ViT模型在海底图像分析中的强大泛化能力。

Abstract: High-throughput interpretation of robotically gathered seafloor visual
imagery can increase the efficiency of marine monitoring and exploration.
Although recent research has suggested that location metadata can enhance
self-supervised feature learning (SSL), its benefits across different SSL
strategies, models and seafloor image datasets are underexplored. This study
evaluates the impact of location-based regularisation on six state-of-the-art
SSL frameworks, which include Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision
Transformer (ViT) models with varying latent-space dimensionality. Evaluation
across three diverse seafloor image datasets finds that location-regularisation
consistently improves downstream classification performance over standard SSL,
with average F1-score gains of $4.9 \pm 4.0%$ for CNNs and $6.3 \pm 8.9%$ for
ViTs, respectively. While CNNs pretrained on generic datasets benefit from
high-dimensional latent representations, dataset-optimised SSL achieves similar
performance across the high (512) and low (128) dimensional latent
representations. Location-regularised SSL improves CNN performance over
pre-trained models by $2.7 \pm 2.7%$ and $10.1 \pm 9.4%$ for high and
low-dimensional latent representations, respectively. For ViTs,
high-dimensionality benefits both pre-trained and dataset-optimised SSL.
Although location-regularisation improves SSL performance compared to standard
SSL methods, pre-trained ViTs show strong generalisation, matching the
best-performing location-regularised SSL with F1-scores of $0.795 \pm 0.075$
and $0.795 \pm 0.077$, respectively. The findings highlight the value of
location metadata for SSL regularisation, particularly when using
low-dimensional latent representations, and demonstrate strong generalisation
of high-dimensional ViTs for seafloor image analysis.

TL;DR: 一种无监督的在线聚类框架(OCF)，用于实时解释海底图像，支持长时间自主海洋探索任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着长耗时和海底常驻AUV技术的发展，需要实时解释海底图像以支持适应性任务和优化通信效率，而传统的离线图像分析方法无法满足实时需求。

Method: 设计了一种在线聚类框架(OCF)，能够在无监督情况下处理连续数据流。该方法通过识别和维护一组代表性样本来捕捉特征分布的演化，支持动态聚类合并和分割，无需重新处理全部图像历史。

Result: 在三个多样化海底图像数据集上评估，OCF在所有比较在线聚类方法中获得最高平均F1分数(0.68)，标准偏差为3%，显示了其优秀的聚类能力和对调查轨迹变化的稳健性。同时维持了较低且有界的计算时间。

Conclusion: OCF框架具有重要价值，特别是在生成调查数据摘要和支持长期持续自主海洋探索中的信息化路径规划方面。

Abstract: As long-endurance and seafloor-resident AUVs become more capable, there is an
increasing need for extended, real-time interpretation of seafloor imagery to
enable adaptive missions and optimise communication efficiency. Although
offline image analysis methods are well established, they rely on access to
complete datasets and human-labelled examples to manage the strong influence of
environmental and operational conditions on seafloor image
appearance-requirements that cannot be met in real-time settings. To address
this, we introduce an online clustering framework (OCF) capable of interpreting
seafloor imagery without supervision, which is designed to operate in real-time
on continuous data streams in a scalable, adaptive, and self-consistent manner.
The method enables the efficient review and consolidation of common patterns
across the entire data history in constant time by identifying and maintaining
a set of representative samples that capture the evolving feature distribution,
supporting dynamic cluster merging and splitting without reprocessing the full
image history. We evaluate the framework on three diverse seafloor image
datasets, analysing the impact of different representative sampling strategies
on both clustering accuracy and computational cost. The OCF achieves the
highest average F1 score of 0.68 across the three datasets among all
comparative online clustering approaches, with a standard deviation of 3%
across three distinct survey trajectories, demonstrating its superior
clustering capability and robustness to trajectory variation. In addition, it
maintains consistently lower and bounded computational time as the data volume
increases. These properties are beneficial for generating survey data summaries
and supporting informative path planning in long-term, persistent autonomous
marine exploration.

Conclusion: VIM-GS成功解决了大场景中单目深度估计的挑战，通过结合稀疏和稠密深度信息实现了高质量的高斯泼溅渲染

Abstract: VIM-GS is a Gaussian Splatting (GS) framework using monocular images for
novel-view synthesis (NVS) in large scenes. GS typically requires accurate
depth to initiate Gaussian ellipsoids using RGB-D/stereo cameras. Their limited
depth sensing range makes it difficult for GS to work in large scenes.
Monocular images, however, lack depth to guide the learning and lead to
inferior NVS results. Although large foundation models (LFMs) for monocular
depth estimation are available, they suffer from cross-frame inconsistency,
inaccuracy for distant scenes, and ambiguity in deceptive texture cues. This
paper aims to generate dense, accurate depth images from monocular RGB inputs
for high-definite GS rendering. The key idea is to leverage the accurate but
sparse depth from visual-inertial Structure-from-Motion (SfM) to refine the
dense but coarse depth from LFMs. To bridge the sparse input and dense output,
we propose an object-segmented depth propagation algorithm that renders the
depth of pixels of structured objects. Then we develop a dynamic depth
refinement module to handle the crippled SfM depth of dynamic objects and
refine the coarse LFM depth. Experiments using public and customized datasets
demonstrate the superior rendering quality of VIM-GS in large scenes.

Abstract: Segmentation-oriented Industrial Anomaly Synthesis (SIAS) plays a pivotal
role in enhancing the performance of downstream anomaly segmentation, as it
provides an effective means of expanding abnormal data. However, existing SIAS
methods face several critical limitations: (i) the synthesized anomalies often
lack intricate texture details and fail to align precisely with the surrounding
background, and (ii) they struggle to generate fine-grained, pixel-level
anomalies. To address these challenges, we propose Segmentation-oriented
Anomaly synthesis via Graded diffusion with Explicit mask alignment, termed
STAGE. STAGE introduces a novel anomaly inference strategy that incorporates
clean background information as a prior to guide the denoising distribution,
enabling the model to more effectively distinguish and highlight abnormal
foregrounds. Furthermore, it employs a graded diffusion framework with an
anomaly-only branch to explicitly record local anomalies during both the
forward and reverse processes, ensuring that subtle anomalies are not
overlooked. Finally, STAGE incorporates the explicit mask alignment (EMA)
strategy to progressively align the synthesized anomalies with the background,
resulting in context-consistent and structurally coherent generations.
Extensive experiments on the MVTec and BTAD datasets demonstrate that STAGE
achieves state-of-the-art performance in SIAS, which in turn enhances
downstream anomaly segmentation.

Abstract: Trajectory-Guided image-to-video (I2V) generation aims to synthesize videos
that adhere to user-specified motion instructions. Existing methods typically
rely on computationally expensive fine-tuning on scarce annotated datasets.
Although some zero-shot methods attempt to trajectory control in the latent
space, they may yield unrealistic motion by neglecting 3D perspective and
creating a misalignment between the manipulated latents and the network's noise
predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce Zo3T, a novel zero-shot
test-time-training framework for trajectory-guided generation with three core
innovations: First, we incorporate a 3D-Aware Kinematic Projection, leveraging
inferring scene depth to derive perspective-correct affine transformations for
target regions. Second, we introduce Trajectory-Guided Test-Time LoRA, a
mechanism that dynamically injects and optimizes ephemeral LoRA adapters into
the denoising network alongside the latent state. Driven by a regional feature
consistency loss, this co-adaptation effectively enforces motion constraints
while allowing the pre-trained model to locally adapt its internal
representations to the manipulated latent, thereby ensuring generative fidelity
and on-manifold adherence. Finally, we develop Guidance Field Rectification,
which refines the denoising evolutionary path by optimizing the conditional
guidance field through a one-step lookahead strategy, ensuring efficient
generative progression towards the target trajectory. Zo3T significantly
enhances 3D realism and motion accuracy in trajectory-controlled I2V
generation, demonstrating superior performance over existing training-based and
zero-shot approaches.

Abstract: Histopathology image analysis is critical yet challenged by the demand of
segmenting tissue regions and nuclei instances for tumor microenvironment and
cellular morphology analysis. Existing studies focused on tissue semantic
segmentation or nuclei instance segmentation separately, but ignored the
inherent relationship between these two tasks, resulting in insufficient
histopathology understanding. To address this issue, we propose a Co-Seg
framework for collaborative tissue and nuclei segmentation. Specifically, we
introduce a novel co-segmentation paradigm, allowing tissue and nuclei
segmentation tasks to mutually enhance each other. To this end, we first devise
a region-aware prompt encoder (RP-Encoder) to provide high-quality semantic and
instance region prompts as prior constraints. Moreover, we design a mutual
prompt mask decoder (MP-Decoder) that leverages cross-guidance to strengthen
the contextual consistency of both tasks, collaboratively computing semantic
and instance segmentation masks. Extensive experiments on the PUMA dataset
demonstrate that the proposed Co-Seg surpasses state-of-the-arts in the
semantic, instance and panoptic segmentation of tumor tissues and nuclei
instances. The source code is available at https://github.com/xq141839/Co-Seg.

Abstract: Uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly deployed in forest
environments for tasks such as environmental monitoring and search and rescue,
which require safe navigation through dense foliage and precise data
collection. Traditional sensing approaches, including passive multispectral and
RGB imaging, suffer from latency, poor depth resolution, and strong dependence
on ambient light - especially under forest canopies. In this work, we present a
novel event spectroscopy system that simultaneously enables high-resolution,
low-latency depth reconstruction and multispectral imaging using a single
sensor. Depth is reconstructed using structured light, and by modulating the
wavelength of the projected structured light, our system captures spectral
information in controlled bands between 650 nm and 850 nm. We demonstrate up to
$60\%$ improvement in RMSE over commercial depth sensors and validate the
spectral accuracy against a reference spectrometer and commercial multispectral
cameras, demonstrating comparable performance. A portable version limited to
RGB (3 wavelengths) is used to collect real-world depth and spectral data from
a Masoala Rainforest. We demonstrate the use of this prototype for color image
reconstruction and material differentiation between leaves and branches using
spectral and depth data. Our results show that adding depth (available at no
extra effort with our setup) to material differentiation improves the accuracy
by over $30\%$ compared to color-only method. Our system, tested in both lab

Abstract: With the rapid development of computer vision and machine learning, automated
methods for pothole detection and recognition based on image and video data
have received significant attention. It is of great significance for social
development to conduct an in-depth analysis of road images through feature
extraction, thereby achieving automatic identification of the pothole condition
in new images. Consequently, this is the main issue addressed in this study.
Based on preprocessing techniques such as standardization, normalization, and
data augmentation applied to the collected raw dataset, we continuously
improved the network model based on experimental results. Ultimately, we
constructed a deep learning feature extraction network
ResNet50-EfficientNet-RegNet model based on transfer learning. This model
exhibits high classification accuracy and computational efficiency. In terms of
model evaluation, this study employed a comparative evaluation approach by
comparing the performance of the proposed transfer learning model with other
models, including Random Forest, MLP, SVM, and LightGBM. The comparison
analysis was conducted based on metrics such as Accuracy, Recall, Precision,
F1-score, and FPS, to assess the classification performance of the transfer
learning model proposed in this paper. The results demonstrate that our model
exhibits high performance in terms of recognition speed and accuracy,
surpassing the performance of other models. Through careful parameter selection
and model optimization, our transfer learning model achieved a classification
accuracy of 97.78% (88/90) on the initial set of 90 test samples and 98.89%
(890/900) on the expanded test set.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Raw2Event是一个硬件-软件系统，能够从低成本原始帧相机实时生成事件流，提供比RGB转换器更高的动态范围、分辨率和保真度输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机虽然具有高时间分辨率、低延迟和高动态范围等优势，但成本高、分辨率有限且缺乏自动对焦等功能，限制了其广泛应用，特别是在早期开发和原型设计阶段。

Method: 通过直接访问原始Bayer数据并绕过传统图像信号处理器(ISP)，基于DVS-Voltmeter模型构建可配置的仿真框架，并设计支持原始数据、RGB和事件流同步记录的数据采集管道。

Result: 实验结果显示Raw2Event能够生成与真实事件相机非常相似的事件流，同时受益于更高分辨率和自动对焦能力，支持实时部署在树莓派等嵌入式平台。

Conclusion: 该系统提供了一个可扩展且成本效益高的解决方案，支持基于事件的视觉研究和早期系统开发，支持用户直观的参数调整以适应各种应用需求。

Abstract: Event cameras offer unique advantages such as high temporal resolution, low
latency, and high dynamic range, making them more and more popular for vision
tasks under challenging light conditions. However, their high cost, limited
resolution, and lack of features such as autofocus hinder their broad adoption,
particularly for early-stage development and prototyping. In this work, we
present Raw2Event, a complete hardware-software system that enables real-time
event generation from low-cost raw frame-based cameras. By leveraging direct
access to raw Bayer data and bypassing traditional image signal processors
(ISP), our system is able to utilize the full potential of camera hardware,
delivering higher dynamic range, higher resolution, and more faithful output
than RGB-based frame-to-event converters.
  Built upon the DVS-Voltmeter model, Raw2Event features a configurable
simulation framework optimized for deployment on embedded platforms. We further
design a data acquisition pipeline that supports synchronized recording of raw,
RGB, and event streams, facilitating downstream evaluation and dataset
creation. Experimental results show that Raw2Event can generate event streams
closely resembling those from real event cameras, while benefiting from higher
resolution and autofocus capabilities. The system also supports user-intuitive
parameter tuning, enabling flexible adaptation to various application
requirements. Finally, we deploy the system on a Raspberry Pi for real-time
operation, providing a scalable and cost-effective solution for event-based
vision research and early-stage system development.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种多模态黑色幽默检测方法，通过解释生成和角色转换自我循环来提升检测精度，并释放了一个新的民主黑色幽默数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在线模图中黑色幽默检测的挑战，包括隐含性、敏感性和文化上下文依赖，以及缺乏多模态资源和方法的问题。

Method: 构建了4,379个Reddit模图的注释数据集，包含黑色幽默标签、目标类别和强度评级。提出了一种推理增强框架，通过角色转换自我循环使大视觉-语言模型生成结构化解释，然后使用三流交叉推理网络(TCRNet)融合文本、图像和推理特征。

Conclusion: 该研究为多模态幽默理解和内容审查提供了有价值的资源和方法，通过解释生成和多模态融合提升了黑色幽默检测的性能。

Abstract: Dark humor in online memes poses unique challenges due to its reliance on
implicit, sensitive, and culturally contextual cues. To address the lack of
resources and methods for detecting dark humor in multimodal content, we
introduce a novel dataset of 4,379 Reddit memes annotated for dark humor,
target category (gender, mental health, violence, race, disability, and other),
and a three-level intensity rating (mild, moderate, severe). Building on this
resource, we propose a reasoning-augmented framework that first generates
structured explanations for each meme using a Large Vision-Language Model
(VLM). Through a Role-Reversal Self-Loop, VLM adopts the author's perspective
to iteratively refine its explanations, ensuring completeness and alignment. We
then extract textual features from both the OCR transcript and the self-refined
reasoning via a text encoder, while visual features are obtained using a vision
transformer. A Tri-stream Cross-Reasoning Network (TCRNet) fuses these three
streams, text, image, and reasoning, via pairwise attention mechanisms,
producing a unified representation for classification. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach outperforms strong baselines across three tasks:
dark humor detection, target identification, and intensity prediction. The
dataset, annotations, and code are released to facilitate further research in
multimodal humor understanding and content moderation. Code and Dataset are

Motivation: 解决真实激光雷达数据采集成本高、标注困难的问题，通过数字孪生技术创建高保真合成数据集来增强现有基准数据集，提高样本量和场景多样性。

Method: 使用数字孪生技术，基于实际位置的几何结构、道路对齐和车辆运动模式，通过模拟激光雷达传感器合成数据集，包含3D边界框、实例分割标签、跟踪ID和语义分割标签。

Conclusion: UrbanTwin数据集是首个能够替代真实激光雷达感知任务的数字合成数据集，具有独立使用和数据增强的双重价值，可通过修改模拟设计和动态来测试自定义场景。

Abstract: This article presents UrbanTwin datasets - high-fidelity, realistic replicas
of three public roadside lidar datasets: LUMPI, V2X-Real-IC, and TUMTraf-I.
Each UrbanTwin dataset contains 10K annotated frames corresponding to one of
the public datasets. Annotations include 3D bounding boxes, instance
segmentation labels, and tracking IDs for six object classes, along with
semantic segmentation labels for nine classes. These datasets are synthesized
using emulated lidar sensors within realistic digital twins, modeled based on
surrounding geometry, road alignment at lane level, and the lane topology and
vehicle movement patterns at intersections of the actual locations
corresponding to each real dataset. Due to the precise digital twin modeling,
the synthetic datasets are well aligned with their real counterparts, offering
strong standalone and augmentative value for training deep learning models on
tasks such as 3D object detection, tracking, and semantic and instance
segmentation. We evaluate the alignment of the synthetic replicas through
statistical and structural similarity analysis with real data, and further
demonstrate their utility by training 3D object detection models solely on
synthetic data and testing them on real, unseen data. The high similarity
scores and improved detection performance, compared to the models trained on
real data, indicate that the UrbanTwin datasets effectively enhance existing
benchmark datasets by increasing sample size and scene diversity. In addition,
the digital twins can be adapted to test custom scenarios by modifying the
design and dynamics of the simulations. To our knowledge, these are the first
digitally synthesized datasets that can replace in-domain real-world datasets
for lidar perception tasks. UrbanTwin datasets are publicly available at

Abstract: Segmenting 3D assets into their constituent parts is crucial for enhancing 3D
understanding, facilitating model reuse, and supporting various applications
such as part generation. However, current methods face limitations such as poor
robustness when dealing with complex objects and cannot fully automate the
process. In this paper, we propose a native 3D point-promptable part
segmentation model termed P3-SAM, designed to fully automate the segmentation
of any 3D objects into components. Inspired by SAM, P3-SAM consists of a
feature extractor, multiple segmentation heads, and an IoU predictor, enabling
interactive segmentation for users. We also propose an algorithm to
automatically select and merge masks predicted by our model for part instance
segmentation. Our model is trained on a newly built dataset containing nearly
3.7 million models with reasonable segmentation labels. Comparisons show that
our method achieves precise segmentation results and strong robustness on any
complex objects, attaining state-of-the-art performance. Our code will be
released soon.

Abstract: In the field of autonomous driving, sensor simulation is essential for
generating rare and diverse scenarios that are difficult to capture in
real-world environments. Current solutions fall into two categories: 1)
CG-based methods, such as CARLA, which lack diversity and struggle to scale to
the vast array of rare cases required for robust perception training; and 2)
learning-based approaches, such as NeuSim, which are limited to specific object
categories (vehicles) and require extensive multi-sensor data, hindering their
applicability to generic objects. To address these limitations, we propose a
scalable real2sim2real system that leverages 3D generation to automate asset
mining, generation, and rare-case data synthesis.

blur effects. By adaptively averaging frames based on computed optical flow
metrics, MIORe generates consistent motion blur, and preserves sharp inputs for
video frame interpolation and optical flow estimation. VAR-MIORe further
extends by spanning a variable range of motion magnitudes, from minimal to

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类对脸部更加敏感，现有图像定制方法在多参考图像下难以保持身份一致性且容易出现身份混淆，限制了身份可扩展性。

Method: 提出UMO框架，将多身份生成重新定义为全局分配优化问题，通过扩散模型上的强化学习实现多身份一致性，并构建了包含合成和真实数据的多参考图像数据集。

Result: 大量实验表明UMO显著提高了身份一致性，减少了身份混淆，在身份保持维度上达到了开源方法的新state-of-the-art。

Conclusion: UMO有效解决了多身份图像定制中的身份一致性和混淆问题，为图像定制方法提供了通用的多身份优化解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in image customization exhibit a wide range of
application prospects due to stronger customization capabilities. However,
since we humans are more sensitive to faces, a significant challenge remains in
preserving consistent identity while avoiding identity confusion with
multi-reference images, limiting the identity scalability of customization
models. To address this, we present UMO, a Unified Multi-identity Optimization
framework, designed to maintain high-fidelity identity preservation and
alleviate identity confusion with scalability. With "multi-to-multi matching"
paradigm, UMO reformulates multi-identity generation as a global assignment
optimization problem and unleashes multi-identity consistency for existing
image customization methods generally through reinforcement learning on
diffusion models. To facilitate the training of UMO, we develop a scalable
customization dataset with multi-reference images, consisting of both
synthesised and real parts. Additionally, we propose a new metric to measure
identity confusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMO not only
improves identity consistency significantly, but also reduces identity
confusion on several image customization methods, setting a new
state-of-the-art among open-source methods along the dimension of identity
preserving. Code and model: https://github.com/bytedance/UMO

Method: 采用三种对比学习框架(实例判别、上下文对比、多视图对比)，结合LRCN(CNN+LSTM)骨干网络和Bahdanau注意力机制，评估多种对比损失函数

Result: Contextual Contrastive Learning框架表现最佳，达到88%准确率和0.8815 F1分数，能有效区分PG-13和R级等细粒度边界

Conclusion: 提出的混合架构在对比学习框架下实现了state-of-the-art性能，并部署为实时分类的web应用，为流媒体平台提供自动化内容合规解决方案

Abstract: The rapid growth of visual content consumption across platforms necessitates
automated video classification for age-suitability standards like the MPAA
rating system (G, PG, PG-13, R). Traditional methods struggle with large
labeled data requirements, poor generalization, and inefficient feature
learning. To address these challenges, we employ contrastive learning for
improved discrimination and adaptability, exploring three frameworks: Instance
Discrimination, Contextual Contrastive Learning, and Multi-View Contrastive
Learning. Our hybrid architecture integrates an LRCN (CNN+LSTM) backbone with a
Bahdanau attention mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the
Contextual Contrastive Learning framework, with 88% accuracy and an F1 score of
0.8815. By combining CNNs for spatial features, LSTMs for temporal modeling,
and attention mechanisms for dynamic frame prioritization, the model excels in
fine-grained borderline distinctions, such as differentiating PG-13 and R-rated
content. We evaluate the model's performance across various contrastive loss
functions, including NT-Xent, NT-logistic, and Margin Triplet, demonstrating
the robustness of our proposed architecture. To ensure practical application,
the model is deployed as a web application for real-time MPAA rating
classification, offering an efficient solution for automated content compliance

Abstract: AI-assisted radiological interpretation is based on predominantly narrow,
single-task models. This approach is impractical for covering the vast spectrum
of imaging modalities, diseases, and radiological findings. Foundation models
(FMs) hold the promise of broad generalization across modalities and in
low-data settings. However, this potential has remained largely unrealized in
radiology. We introduce Curia, a foundation model trained on the entire
cross-sectional imaging output of a major hospital over several years, which to
our knowledge is the largest such corpus of real-world data-encompassing
150,000 exams (130 TB). On a newly curated 19-task external validation
benchmark, Curia accurately identifies organs, detects conditions like brain
hemorrhages and myocardial infarctions, and predicts outcomes in tumor staging.
Curia meets or surpasses the performance of radiologists and recent foundation
models, and exhibits clinically significant emergent properties in
cross-modality, and low-data regimes. To accelerate progress, we release our
base model's weights at https://huggingface.co/raidium/curia.

Abstract: We investigate how both the adaptation of a generic foundation model via
transfer learning and the integration of complementary modalities from the
operating room (OR) can support surgical data science. To this end, we use
V-JEPA as the single-modality foundation of a multimodal model for minimally
invasive surgery support. We analyze how the model's downstream performance can
benefit (a) from finetuning on unlabeled surgical video data and (b) from
providing additional time-resolved data streams from the OR in a multimodal
setup.
  In an in-house dataset of liver surgery videos, we analyze the tasks of
predicting hospital length of stay and postoperative complications. In videos
of the public HeiCo dataset, we analyze the task of surgical phase recognition.
As a baseline, we apply pretrained V-JEPA to all tasks. We then finetune it on
unlabeled, held-out videos to investigate its change in performance after
domain adaptation. Following the idea of modular decision support networks, we
integrate additional data streams from the OR by training a separate encoder to
form a shared representation space with V-JEPA's embeddings.
  Our experiments show that finetuning on domain-specific data increases model
performance. On the in-house data, integrating additional time-resolved data
likewise benefits the model. On the HeiCo data, accuracy of the pretrained
video-only, single-modality baseline setup is on par with the top-performing
submissions of the EndoVis2017 challenge, while finetuning on domain-specific
data increases accuracy further. Our results thus demonstrate how surgical data
science can leverage public, generic foundation models. Likewise, they indicate
the potential of domain adaptation and of integrating suitable complementary
data streams from the OR. To support further research, we release our code and
model weights at https://github.com/DigitalSurgeryLab-Basel/ML-CDS-2025.

Method: 收集和注释了1,228张高质量动漫图片，并在这个自建数据集上对开源BiRefNet模型进行精细调整

Result: 动漫图像背景移除准确度从95.3%提升到99.5%（采用新的像素准确度指标）

Abstract: While state-of-the-art background removal models excel at realistic imagery,
they frequently underperform in specialized domains such as anime-style
content, where complex features like hair and transparency present unique
challenges. To address this limitation, we collected and annotated a custom
dataset of 1,228 high-quality anime images of characters and objects, and
fine-tuned the open-sourced BiRefNet model on this dataset. This resulted in
marked improvements in background removal accuracy for anime-style images,
increasing from 95.3% to 99.5% for our newly introduced Pixel Accuracy metric.
We are open-sourcing the code, the fine-tuned model weights, as well as the
dataset at: https://github.com/MatteoKartoon/BiRefNet.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前方法在处理含有拓扑异常的3D网格时的限制，特别是在实际应用场景中如每帧多视角重建结果中常见的拓扑问题。

Method: 提出了一种拓扑适应性变形模型，允许形状拓扑发生变化来对齐形状对，并在ARAP和双射关联约束下联合优化模板网格和对齐。

Result: 方法能够处理高度非等对形形状和含有拓扑异常的形状，包括噪声多视角重建，甚至在3D对齐质量上超过基于大数据集训练的方法。

Conclusion: 该方法不依赖于任何数据驱动先验知识，能够有效处理复杂的拓扑异常情况，为非粗粒3D网格匹配提供了可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Non-rigid 3D mesh matching is a critical step in computer vision and computer
graphics pipelines. We tackle matching meshes that contain topological
artefacts which can break the assumption made by current approaches. While
Functional Maps assume the deformation induced by the ground truth
correspondences to be near-isometric, ARAP-like deformation-guided approaches
assume the latter to be ARAP. Neither assumption holds in certain topological
configurations of the input shapes. We are motivated by real-world scenarios
such as per-frame multi-view reconstructions, often suffering from topological
artefacts. To this end, we propose a topology-adaptive deformation model
allowing changes in shape topology to align shape pairs under ARAP and
bijective association constraints. Using this model, we jointly optimise for a
template mesh with adequate topology and for its alignment with the shapes to
be matched to extract correspondences. We show that, while not relying on any
data-driven prior, our approach applies to highly non-isometric shapes and
shapes with topological artefacts, including noisy per-frame multi-view
reconstructions, even outperforming methods trained on large datasets in 3D
alignment quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于GAN去模糊和YOLOv5的自动车牌识别系统，在预处理步骤使用选择性GAN去模糊，然后采用YOLOv5进行车牌检测和字符识别，实现了高准确率和实时性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动车牌识别(ALPR)在智慧城市中致关重要，但高变化性带来挑战，需要深度学习技术更有效解决。特别是处理模糊车牌图像的问题。

Method: 提出选择性GAN去模糊预处理步骤，避免不必要的输入操作；结合YOLOv5对象检测架构进行车牌检测(LPD)，以及集成的字符分割(CS)和字符识别(CR)步骤。

Result: 系统实现了车牌检测95%和字符识别97%的准确率，检测时间仅0.026秒，适合实时应用。去模糊GAN预处理器将检测准确率提高了近40%，特别是对模糊车牌图像。

Conclusion: 结合YOLOv5和去模糊GAN的综合模型能够实现优秀的准确性和检测速度，适合便携式应用。去模糊预处理步骤显著提升了整体模型效果，尤其在处理摄像头拍摄的模糊场景时。

Abstract: Automatic License-Plate Recognition (ALPR) plays a pivotal role in
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) as a fundamental element of Smart
Cities. However, due to its high variability, ALPR faces challenging issues
more efficiently addressed by deep learning techniques. In this paper, a
selective Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is proposed for deblurring in
the preprocessing step, coupled with the state-of-the-art You-Only-Look-Once
(YOLO)v5 object detection architectures for License-Plate Detection (LPD), and
the integrated Character Segmentation (CS) and Character Recognition (CR)
steps. The selective preprocessing bypasses unnecessary and sometimes
counter-productive input manipulations, while YOLOv5 LPD/CS+CR delivers high
accuracy and low computing cost. As a result, YOLOv5 achieves a detection time
of 0.026 seconds for both LP and CR detection stages, facilitating real-time
applications with exceptionally rapid responsiveness. Moreover, the proposed
model achieves accuracy rates of 95\% and 97\% in the LPD and CR detection
phases, respectively. Furthermore, the inclusion of the Deblur-GAN
pre-processor significantly improves detection accuracy by nearly 40\%,
especially when encountering blurred License Plates (LPs).To train and test the
learning components, we generated and publicly released our blur and ALPR
datasets (using Iranian license plates as a use-case), which are more
representative of close-to-real-life ad-hoc situations. The findings
demonstrate that employing the state-of-the-art YOLO model results in excellent
overall precision and detection time, making it well-suited for portable
applications. Additionally, integrating the Deblur-GAN model as a preliminary
processing step enhances the overall effectiveness of our comprehensive model,
particularly when confronted with blurred scenes captured by the camera as
input.

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的欧几里得近似扭曲了流形结构并减慢了收敛速度，需要更好的方法来捕捉复杂流形结构

Method: 使用CNN-Transformer编码器提取特征嵌入，投影到球形空间，在双不变SO(4)空间中使用Riemannian距离近似测地距离，推理时使用可微Levenberg-Marquardt优化

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上显示出在患者特定和患者无关场景中的优越准确性

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够更准确地捕捉和拟合复杂流形结构，提高配准精度和收敛速度

Abstract: Intraoperative 2D/3D registration aligns preoperative 3D volumes with
real-time 2D radiographs, enabling accurate localization of instruments and
implants. A recent fully differentiable similarity learning framework
approximates geodesic distances on SE(3), expanding the capture range of
registration and mitigating the effects of substantial disturbances, but
existing Euclidean approximations distort manifold structure and slow
convergence. To address these limitations, we explore similarity learning in
non-Euclidean spherical feature spaces to better capture and fit complex
manifold structure. We extract feature embeddings using a CNN-Transformer
encoder, project them into spherical space, and approximate their geodesic
distances with Riemannian distances in the bi-invariant SO(4) space. This
enables a more expressive and geometrically consistent deep similarity metric,
enhancing the ability to distinguish subtle pose differences. During inference,
we replace gradient descent with fully differentiable Levenberg-Marquardt
optimization to accelerate convergence. Experiments on real and synthetic
datasets show superior accuracy in both patient-specific and patient-agnostic
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用预训练大规模扩散模型的强大先验知识来解决盲图像恢复问题，避免训练复杂的辅助特征提取器，降低计算复杂度。

Method: 通过模型本身从退化图像中提取特征，扩展自注意力机制引入退化特征，并采用采样引导机制减少幻觉现象。

Result: 在合成和真实退化场景下，BIR-Adapter达到或超越最先进方法的性能，同时显著降低复杂度，并能集成到其他扩散模型中扩展应用。

Conclusion: BIR-Adapter提供了一种高效、低复杂度的盲图像恢复解决方案，具有良好的扩展性和实际应用价值。

Abstract: This paper introduces BIR-Adapter, a low-complexity blind image restoration
adapter for diffusion models. The BIR-Adapter enables the utilization of the
prior of pre-trained large-scale diffusion models on blind image restoration
without training any auxiliary feature extractor. We take advantage of the
robustness of pretrained models. We extract features from degraded images via
the model itself and extend the self-attention mechanism with these degraded
features. We introduce a sampling guidance mechanism to reduce hallucinations.
We perform experiments on synthetic and real-world degradations and demonstrate
that BIR-Adapter achieves competitive or better performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods while having significantly lower complexity.
Additionally, its adapter-based design enables integration into other diffusion
models, enabling broader applications in image restoration tasks. We showcase
this by extending a super-resolution-only model to perform better under
additional unknown degradations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决通用预训练模型在农业视觉监测中泛化能力不足的问题，因为精细多变的冠层结构与波动的田间条件相互作用导致模型性能下降

Method: 使用自监督学习在ImAg4Wheat数据集（250万张高分辨率图像，覆盖10年30个全球站点、2000+基因型和500+环境条件）上进行小麦特异性预训练

Result: FoMo4Wheat模型在冠层和器官级别的10个田间视觉任务中 consistently outperform 最先进的通用预训练模型，且表征对小麦稳健并可迁移到其他作物和杂草

Conclusion: 作物特异性基础模型对可靠的田间感知具有重要价值，为构建具有跨物种和跨任务能力的通用作物基础模型指明了方向

Abstract: Vision-driven field monitoring is central to digital agriculture, yet models
built on general-domain pretrained backbones often fail to generalize across
tasks, owing to the interaction of fine, variable canopy structures with
fluctuating field conditions. We present FoMo4Wheat, one of the first
crop-domain vision foundation model pretrained with self-supervision on
ImAg4Wheat, the largest and most diverse wheat image dataset to date (2.5
million high-resolution images collected over a decade at 30 global sites,
spanning >2,000 genotypes and >500 environmental conditions). This
wheat-specific pretraining yields representations that are robust for wheat and
transferable to other crops and weeds. Across ten in-field vision tasks at
canopy and organ levels, FoMo4Wheat models consistently outperform
state-of-the-art models pretrained on general-domain dataset. These results
demonstrate the value of crop-specific foundation models for reliable in-field
perception and chart a path toward a universal crop foundation model with
cross-species and cross-task capabilities. FoMo4Wheat models and the ImAg4Wheat
dataset are publicly available online: https://github.com/PheniX-Lab/FoMo4Wheat

Conclusion: 离散单元表示在语音语言模型的持续预训练中具有重要作用，模型容量、聚类策略和领域匹配都是影响语音建模效果的关键因素。

Abstract: This paper investigates discrete unit representations in Speech Language
Models (SLMs), focusing on optimizing speech modeling during continual
pre-training. In this paper, we systematically examine how model architecture,
data representation, and training robustness influence the pre-training stage
in which we adapt existing pre-trained language models to the speech modality.
Our experiments highlight the role of speech encoders and clustering
granularity across different model scales, showing how optimal discretization
strategies vary with model capacity. By examining cluster distribution and
phonemic alignments, we investigate the effective use of discrete vocabulary,
uncovering both linguistic and paralinguistic patterns. Additionally, we
explore the impact of clustering data selection on model robustness,
highlighting the importance of domain matching between discretization training
and target applications.

TL;DR: 基于N-Gram频率张量的新题检测方法，通过张量分解提取特征，在HaluEval数据集上较传统方法显著提升检测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM幻觉问题，传统评价指标如ROUGE、BERTScore等缺乏语义深度，无法有效检测幻觉内容

Method: 构建N-Gram频率张量捕捉语义结构，通过张量分解提取奇异值特征，使用MLP二分类器进行幻觉检测

Result: 在HaluEval数据集上表现优异，显著超越传统基线方法，与最先进的LLM判官方法竞争性能相当

Conclusion: 提出的N-Gram张量方法能够捕捉更丰富的语义结构，为LLM幻觉检测提供了有效的新途径

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated effectiveness across a wide
variety of tasks involving natural language, however, a fundamental problem of
hallucinations still plagues these models, limiting their trustworthiness in
generating consistent, truthful information. Detecting hallucinations has
quickly become an important topic, with various methods such as uncertainty
estimation, LLM Judges, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and consistency
checks showing promise. Many of these methods build upon foundational metrics,
such as ROUGE, BERTScore, or Perplexity, which often lack the semantic depth
necessary to detect hallucinations effectively. In this work, we propose a
novel approach inspired by ROUGE that constructs an N-Gram frequency tensor
from LLM-generated text. This tensor captures richer semantic structure by
encoding co-occurrence patterns, enabling better differentiation between
factual and hallucinated content. We demonstrate this by applying tensor
decomposition methods to extract singular values from each mode and use these
as input features to train a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) binary classifier for
hallucinations. Our method is evaluated on the HaluEval dataset and
demonstrates significant improvements over traditional baselines, as well as
competitive performance against state-of-the-art LLM judges.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SAGE是一个触发引导的动态微调框架，能够在推理时实现自适应更新，通过检测推理失败、聚类异常样本和动态优化参数来解决大语言模型无法在推理时持续学习的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在推理时无法持续适应和学习新数据，这限制了它们在复杂推理任务中的表现。

Method: SAGE包含三个核心组件：触发模块实时检测推理失败，触发缓冲模块使用HDBSCAN流式聚类异常样本并进行稳定性检查和相似性合并，Lora存储模块通过适配器池动态优化参数更新以实现知识保留。

Result: 评估结果显示，SAGE在原子推理子任务上通过测试时的动态知识更新表现出优秀的准确性、鲁棒性和稳定性。

Conclusion: SAGE框架有效解决了大语言模型在推理时无法持续学习的问题，为复杂推理任务的分解和动态适应提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models are unable to continuously adapt and learn from new
data during reasoning at inference time. To address this limitation, we propose
that complex reasoning tasks be decomposed into atomic subtasks and introduce
SAGE, a trigger-guided dynamic fine-tuning framework that enables adaptive
updates during reasoning at inference time. SAGE consists of three key
components: (1) a Trigger module that detects reasoning failures through
multiple evaluation metrics in real time; (2) a Trigger Buffer module that
clusters anomaly samples using a streaming clustering process with HDBSCAN,
followed by stability checks and similarity-based merging; and (3) a Lora Store
module that dynamically optimizes parameter updates with an adapter pool for
knowledge retention. Evaluation results show that SAGE demonstrates excellent
accuracy, robustness, and stability on the atomic reasoning subtask through
dynamic knowledge updating during test time.

TL;DR: 研究发现多智能体辩论有时会降低准确性，特别是在模型能力不同的群体中，即使强模型占多数，辩论也可能导致性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索模型能力多样性如何影响多智能体辩论的动态和结果，此前研究只关注同质智能体群体的辩论。

Method: 通过一系列实验分析多智能体辩论过程，观察模型在辩论中的回答变化和行为模式。

Result: 辩论会导致准确性随时间下降，模型经常从正确答案转向错误答案，倾向于达成共识而非挑战错误推理。

Conclusion: 多智能体辩论存在重要失败模式，当智能体既无激励也无足够能力抵抗有说服力但错误的推理时，简单的辩论应用可能导致性能退化。

Abstract: While multi-agent debate has been proposed as a promising strategy for
improving AI reasoning ability, we find that debate can sometimes be harmful
rather than helpful. The prior work has exclusively focused on debates within
homogeneous groups of agents, whereas we explore how diversity in model
capabilities influences the dynamics and outcomes of multi-agent interactions.
Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that debate can lead to a
decrease in accuracy over time -- even in settings where stronger (i.e., more
capable) models outnumber their weaker counterparts. Our analysis reveals that
models frequently shift from correct to incorrect answers in response to peer
reasoning, favoring agreement over challenging flawed reasoning. These results
highlight important failure modes in the exchange of reasons during multi-agent
debate, suggesting that naive applications of debate may cause performance
degradation when agents are neither incentivized nor adequately equipped to
resist persuasive but incorrect reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何在不运行实际翻译系统的情况下，仅通过语言特征预测翻译质量，以提高多语言评估的效率

Method: 使用语言家族、字符、地区等语言元数据，加上词汇生成率比例和词汇计数特征，构建梯度提升模型进行预测

Result: 在FLORES-200语言对中获得良好表现（R²=0.66用于XX→英语，R²=0.72用于英语→XX），语言类型学特征对英语翻译预测最重要，而词汇生成率在多样化目标语言中作用更大

Conclusion: 翻译质量受到词汇生成率和语言类型学的共同影响，为多语言评估和质量估计提供了新视角

Abstract: We show that translation quality can be predicted with surprising accuracy
\textit{without ever running the translation system itself}. Using only a
handful of features, token fertility ratios, token counts, and basic linguistic
metadata (language family, script, and region), we can forecast ChrF scores for
GPT-4o translations across 203 languages in the FLORES-200 benchmark. Gradient
boosting models achieve favorable performance ($R^{2}=0.66$ for
XX$\rightarrow$English and $R^{2}=0.72$ for English$\rightarrow$XX). Feature
importance analyses reveal that typological factors dominate predictions into
English, while fertility plays a larger role for translations into diverse
target languages. These findings suggest that translation quality is shaped by
both token-level fertility and broader linguistic typology, offering new
insights for multilingual evaluation and quality estimation.

Conclusion: 新方法能够在保持与成对比方法相似性能的同时，提供绝对评分能力，为需要阈值判断的应用场景提供了解决方案。

Abstract: As large-language models have been increasingly used as automatic raters for
evaluating free-form content, including document summarization, dialog, and
story generation, work has been dedicated to evaluating such models by
measuring their correlations with human judgment. For \textit{sample-level}
performance, methods which operate by using pairwise comparisons between
machine-generated text perform well but often lack the ability to assign
absolute scores to individual summaries, an ability crucial for use cases that
require thresholding. In this work, we propose a direct-scoring method which
uses synthetic summaries to act as pairwise machine rankings at test time. We
show that our method performs comparably to state-of-the-art pairwise
evaluators in terms of axis-averaged sample-level correlations on the SummEval
(\textbf{+0.03}), TopicalChat (\textbf{-0.03}), and HANNA (\textbf{+0.05})
meta-evaluation benchmarks, and release the synthetic in-context summaries as

Motivation: 医院呼叫中心产生大量员工消息数据，但传统监督学习需要注释数据和调优，LLM提供了更高效的分析方法。

Method: 提出多阶段LLM框架，评估了包括推理、通用和轻量级模型在内的多种LLM类型，并结合数据安全和HIPAA合规要求。

Result: 最佳模型o3达到78.4%加权F1分数和79.2%准确率，gpt-5以近75.3%加权F1分数和76.2%准确率随后。处理输出集成到可视化决策支持工具中。

Conclusion: 该方法能够高效利用员工消息数据，识别导航员培训机会，支持改善患者体验和护理质量。

Abstract: Hospital call centers serve as the primary contact point for patients within
a hospital system. They also generate substantial volumes of staff messages as
navigators process patient requests and communicate with the hospital offices
following the established protocol restrictions and guidelines. This
continuously accumulated large amount of text data can be mined and processed
to retrieve insights; however, traditional supervised learning approaches
require annotated data, extensive training, and model tuning. Large Language
Models (LLMs) offer a paradigm shift toward more computationally efficient
methodologies for healthcare analytics. This paper presents a multi-stage
LLM-based framework that identifies staff message topics and classifies
messages by their reasons in a multi-class fashion. In the process, multiple
LLM types, including reasoning, general-purpose, and lightweight models, were
evaluated. The best-performing model was o3, achieving 78.4% weighted F1-score
and 79.2% accuracy, followed closely by gpt-5 (75.3% Weighted F1-score and
76.2% accuracy). The proposed methodology incorporates data security measures
and HIPAA compliance requirements essential for healthcare environments. The
processed LLM outputs are integrated into a visualization decision support tool
that transforms the staff messages into actionable insights accessible to
healthcare professionals. This approach enables more efficient utilization of
the collected staff messaging data, identifies navigator training
opportunities, and supports improved patient experience and care quality.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究评估了10个大型语言模型在AfriMMLU数据集上的表现，发现词汇生成效率（fertility）与准确率呈负相关，高生成率导致计算资源增加和准确率下降，同时发现推理模型在高/低资源语言上都表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决词汇化（tokenization）效率不平等导致的语言不公平问题，牵到语言形态复杂性、计算资源和准确性问题，以及语言处理的公平性需求。

Method: 在AfriMMLU数据集（9,000道多选题，5个学科，16种非洲语言）上评估10个大型语言模型，分析词汇生成效率与准确率的关系，并进行经济学成本分析。

Result: 词汇生成效率高的语言准确率更低，推理模型（DeepSeek, o1）在各种语言上都表现更好，词汇数量倍增会导致训练成本和时间四倍增长。

Conclusion: 建议采用考虑语言形态的词汇化方法，实行公平定价，以及建立多语言评测标准，以促进自然语言处理的公平性。

Abstract: Tokenization inefficiency imposes structural disadvantages on morphologically
complex, low-resource languages, inflating compute resources and depressing
accuracy. We evaluate 10 large language models (LLMs) on AfriMMLU (9,000 MCQA
items; 5 subjects; 16 African languages) and show that fertility (tokens/word)
reliably predicts accuracy. Higher fertility consistently predicts lower
accuracy across all models and subjects. We further find that reasoning models
(DeepSeek, o1) consistently outperform non-reasoning peers across high and low
resource languages in the AfriMMLU dataset, narrowing accuracy gaps observed in
prior generations. Finally, translating token inflation to economics, a
doubling in tokens results in quadrupled training cost and time, underscoring
the token tax faced by many languages. These results motivate morphologically
aware tokenization, fair pricing, and multilingual benchmarks for equitable
natural language processing (NLP).

Abstract: This work presents a Biomedical Literature Question Answering (Q&A) system
based on a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, designed to
improve access to accurate, evidence-based medical information. Addressing the
shortcomings of conventional health search engines and the lag in public access
to biomedical research, the system integrates diverse sources, including PubMed

pipeline uses MiniLM-based semantic embeddings and FAISS vector search, while

TL;DR: 该研究提出双向推理作为测试AI真正理解能力的方法，发现传统微调会导致认知专门化问题，并开发了对比微调(CFT)方法来解决这一问题，成功实现了双向推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI领域一个基本问题：大型语言模型是真正理解概念还是仅仅识别模式。研究者认为真正的理解应该自然允许可逆性，即能够双向应用转换而无需反向训练。

Method: 提出双向推理测试方法，开发对比微调(CFT)技术，使用三种示例进行训练：保持语义的正例、语义不同的负例、以及正向混淆示例，旨在培养深层理解而非表面模式识别。

Result: 实验证明CFT成功实现了双向推理，在保持正向任务能力的同时获得了强大的反向性能，而传统微调会导致反向推理能力显著下降。

Conclusion: 双向推理既是评估真正理解的理论框架，也是开发更强大AI系统的实用训练方法，CFT为解决认知专门化问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This research addresses a fundamental question in AI: whether large language
models truly understand concepts or simply recognize patterns. The authors
propose bidirectional reasoning,the ability to apply transformations in both
directions without being explicitly trained on the reverse direction, as a test
for genuine understanding. They argue that true comprehension should naturally
allow reversibility. For example, a model that can change a variable name like
userIndex to i should also be able to infer that i represents a user index
without reverse training. The researchers tested current language models and
discovered what they term cognitive specialization: when models are fine-tuned
on forward tasks, their performance on those tasks improves, but their ability
to reason bidirectionally becomes significantly worse. To address this issue,
they developed Contrastive Fine-Tuning (CFT), which trains models using three
types of examples: positive examples that maintain semantic meaning, negative
examples with different semantics, and forward-direction obfuscation examples.
This approach aims to develop deeper understanding rather than surface-level
pattern recognition and allows reverse capabilities to develop naturally
without explicit reverse training. Their experiments demonstrated that CFT
successfully achieved bidirectional reasoning, enabling strong reverse
performance while maintaining forward task capabilities. The authors conclude
that bidirectional reasoning serves both as a theoretical framework for
assessing genuine understanding and as a practical training approach for
developing more capable AI systems.

TL;DR: 研究发现人们在建立新共享命名系统时不是简单的任意标签，而是通过概念协调实现泛化，这种泛化遵循视觉相似性衰减规律


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨人们如何谈论从未讨论过的事物，检验两种对立观点：是建立任意标签还是通过概念对齐形成共享描述方式

Method: 使用KiloGram数据集的302对参与者进行双人交流研究，让参与者为一组抽象图形建立指称惯例，然后测量他们对未讨论图像的描述对齐程度

Result: 发现了强烈的泛化证据：伙伴间的对齐程度相对于前测标签显著增加；泛化随视觉相似性非线性衰减（符合Shepard定律）；在不同可命名性水平的图像中都表现稳健

Conclusion: 临时约定不是任意标签，而是反映了真正的概念协调，这对指称理论和设计更自适应的语言代理具有重要意义

Abstract: How do people talk about things they've never talked about before? One view
suggests that a new shared naming system establishes an arbitrary link to a
specific target, like proper names that cannot extend beyond their bearers. An
alternative view proposes that forming a shared way of describing objects
involves broader conceptual alignment, reshaping each individual's semantic
space in ways that should generalize to new referents. We test these competing
accounts in a dyadic communication study (N=302) leveraging the
recently-released KiloGram dataset containing over 1,000 abstract tangram
images. After pairs of participants coordinated on referential conventions for
one set of images through repeated communication, we measured the extent to
which their descriptions aligned for undiscussed images. We found strong
evidence for generalization: partners showed increased alignment relative to
their pre-test labels. Generalization also decayed nonlinearly with visual
similarity (consistent with Shepard's law) and was robust across levels of the
images' nameability. These findings suggest that ad hoc conventions are not
arbitrary labels but reflect genuine conceptual coordination, with implications
for theories of reference and the design of more adaptive language agents.

Motivation: 小语言模型通过微调大语言模型生成的思维链数据来复制推理能力，但这些数据可能包含无法支持答案的噪声推理，导致模型学习到虚假相关性，影响推理质量

Method: 提出Chain-of-Thought Correctness Perception Distillation (CoPeD)：1) 正确性感知任务设置，鼓励模型基于正确推理预测答案并修正错误推理；2) 正确性感知加权损失，根据推理和答案的联合损失动态调整训练样本权重

Result: 实验表明CoPeD在分布内和分布外基准推理数据集上均有效

Conclusion: CoPeD通过改进任务设置和数据利用方式，有效提升了学生模型的推理质量，特别是在处理噪声推理数据方面表现出色

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning tasks but are expensive to
deploy. Thus small language models (SLMs) are fine-tuned on CoT data generated
by LLMs to copy LLMs' abilities. However, these CoT data may include noisy
rationales that either fail to substantiate the answers or contribute no
additional information to support answer prediction, which leads SLMs to
capture spurious correlations between questions and answers and compromise the
quality of reasoning. In this work, we propose Chain-of-Thought Correctness
Perception Distillation (CoPeD), which aims to improve the reasoning quality of
the student model from the perspectives of task setting and data utilization.
Firstly, we introduce a correctness-aware task setting that encourages the
student model to predict answers based on correct rationales and revise them
when they are incorrect. This setting improves the faithfulness of reasoning
and allows the model to learn from its mistakes. Then, we propose a
Correctness-Aware Weighted loss, which dynamically adjusts the contribution of
each training instance based on the combined loss of the rationale and the
answer. This strategy encourages the model to focus more on samples where the
rationale offers stronger support for the correct answer. Experiments have
shown that CoPeD is effective on both in-distribution (IND) and
out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmark reasoning datasets.

Conclusion: Icon²方法通过利用LLM表示空间的固有特性，实现了高效且有效的偏好数据集构建，为LLM对齐提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require high quality preference datasets to
align with human preferences. However, conventional methods for constructing
such datasets face significant challenges: reliance on pre-collected
instructions often leads to distribution mismatches with target models, while
the need for sampling multiple stochastic responses introduces substantial
computational overhead. In this work, we explore a paradigm shift by leveraging
inherent regulation of LLMs' representation space for efficient and tailored
preference dataset construction, named Icon$^{2}$. Specifically, it first
extracts layer-wise direction vectors to encode sophisticated human preferences
and then uses these vectors to filter self-synthesized instructions based on
their inherent consistency. During decoding, bidirectional inherent control is
applied to steer token representations, enabling the precise generation of
response pairs with clear alignment distinctions. Experimental results
demonstrate significant improvements in both alignment and efficiency.
Llama3-8B and Qwen2-7B achieve an average win rate improvement of 13.89% on
AlpacaEval 2.0 and 13.45% on Arena-Hard, while reducing computational costs by
up to 48.1%.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 声学和语言表示的对齐是ASR知识迁移中的核心挑战，存在固有的结构不对称性（多对一、一对多关系）以及噪声帧导致的匹配不平衡问题。

Method: 采用不平衡最优传输模型，显式处理分布不匹配和结构不对称性，实现声学与语言模态之间的软部分匹配，确保每个语言标记至少对应一个声学观测。

Result: 在基于CTC的ASR系统与预训练语言模型的知识迁移实验中，该方法能够灵活控制匹配程度，有效提升了ASR性能。

Conclusion: 将对齐问题视为检测问题，并通过不平衡最优传输方法处理结构不对称性，为ASR中的跨模态知识迁移提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Aligning acoustic and linguistic representations is a central challenge to
bridge the pre-trained models in knowledge transfer for automatic speech
recognition (ASR). This alignment is inherently structured and asymmetric:
while multiple consecutive acoustic frames typically correspond to a single
linguistic token (many-to-one), certain acoustic transition regions may relate
to multiple adjacent tokens (one-to-many). Moreover, acoustic sequences often
include frames with no linguistic counterpart, such as background noise or
silence may lead to imbalanced matching conditions. In this work, we take a new
insight to regard alignment and matching as a detection problem, where the goal
is to identify meaningful correspondences with high precision and recall
ensuring full coverage of linguistic tokens while flexibly handling redundant
or noisy acoustic frames in transferring linguistic knowledge for ASR. Based on
this new insight, we propose an unbalanced optimal transport-based alignment
model that explicitly handles distributional mismatch and structural
asymmetries with soft and partial matching between acoustic and linguistic
modalities. Our method ensures that every linguistic token is grounded in at
least one acoustic observation, while allowing for flexible, probabilistic
mappings from acoustic to linguistic units. We evaluate our proposed model with
experiments on an CTC-based ASR system with a pre-trained language model for
knowledge transfer. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in flexibly controlling degree of matching and hence to improve ASR
performance.

Abstract: The emotional content of song lyrics plays a pivotal role in shaping listener
experiences and influencing musical preferences. This paper investigates the
task of multi-label emotional attribution of song lyrics by predicting six
emotional intensity scores corresponding to six fundamental emotions. A
manually labeled dataset is constructed using a mean opinion score (MOS)
approach, which aggregates annotations from multiple human raters to ensure
reliable ground-truth labels. Leveraging this dataset, we conduct a
comprehensive evaluation of several publicly available large language models
(LLMs) under zero-shot scenarios. Additionally, we fine-tune a BERT-based model
specifically for predicting multi-label emotion scores. Experimental results
reveal the relative strengths and limitations of zero-shot and fine-tuned
models in capturing the nuanced emotional content of lyrics. Our findings
highlight the potential of LLMs for emotion recognition in creative texts,
providing insights into model selection strategies for emotion-based music
information retrieval applications. The labeled dataset is available at

Conclusion: 整合文本和关系结构信息对于提升少样本意图检测性能至关重要，SAID框架为此提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Intent detection is a crucial component of modern conversational systems,
since accurately identifying user intent at the beginning of a conversation is
essential for generating effective responses. Recent efforts have focused on
studying this problem under a challenging few-shot scenario. These approaches
primarily leverage large-scale unlabeled dialogue text corpora to pretrain
language models through various pretext tasks, followed by fine-tuning for
intent detection with very limited annotations. Despite the improvements
achieved, existing methods have predominantly focused on textual data,
neglecting to effectively capture the crucial structural information inherent
in conversational systems, such as the query-query relation and query-answer
relation. To address this gap, we propose SAID, a novel framework that
integrates both textual and relational structure information in a unified
manner for model pretraining for the first time. Building on this framework, we
further propose a novel mechanism, the query-adaptive attention network
(QueryAdapt), which operates at the relation token level by generating
intent-specific relation tokens from well-learned query-query and query-answer
relations explicitly, enabling more fine-grained knowledge transfer. Extensive
experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that SAID
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new avenues for
solving complex optimization problems, including Neural Architecture Search
(NAS). However, existing LLM-driven NAS approaches rely heavily on prompt
engineering and domain-specific tuning, limiting their practicality and
scalability across diverse tasks. In this work, we propose LM-Searcher, a novel
framework that leverages LLMs for cross-domain neural architecture optimization
without the need for extensive domain-specific adaptation. Central to our
approach is NCode, a universal numerical string representation for neural
architectures, which enables cross-domain architecture encoding and search. We
also reformulate the NAS problem as a ranking task, training LLMs to select
high-performing architectures from candidate pools using instruction-tuning
samples derived from a novel pruning-based subspace sampling strategy. Our
curated dataset, encompassing a wide range of architecture-performance pairs,
encourages robust and transferable learning. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that LM-Searcher achieves competitive performance in both in-domain
(e.g., CNNs for image classification) and out-of-domain (e.g., LoRA
configurations for segmentation and generation) tasks, establishing a new
paradigm for flexible and generalizable LLM-based architecture search. The
datasets and models will be released at https://github.com/Ashone3/LM-Searcher.

Method: 首先将问题和解决方案分离，而不是直接将问题-解决方案对输入LLM。然后指导LLM将解决方案适配到新的相关问题上，使其专注于解决方案迁移而非问题识别。该方法还扩展到仅共享部分特征或隐藏特征的情况。

Result: 实验验证表明，该范围扩展方法提高了筛选出可重用解决方案的概率，从而提升了跨问题方法重用的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法成功扩展了方法重用的适用范围，能够处理低相似度和隐藏相似性的问题，通过专注于解决方案迁移而非问题识别来提高重用效果。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely applied to assist in finding
solutions for diverse questions. Prior work has proposed representing a method
as a pair of a question and its corresponding solution, enabling method reuse.
However, existing approaches typically require the questions to be highly
similar. In this paper, we extend the scope of method reuse to address
questions with low similarity or with hidden similarities that are not
explicitly observable. For questions that are similar in a general-specific
sense (i.e., broader or narrower in scope), we propose to first separate the
question and solution, rather than directly feeding the pair to the LLM. The
LLM is then guided to adapt the solution to new but related questions, allowing
it to focus on solution transfer rather than question recognition. Furthermore,
we extend this approach to cases where questions only share partial features or
hidden characteristics. This enables cross-question method reuse beyond
conventional similarity constraints. Experimental verification shows that our
scope-extension approach increases the probability of filtering out reusable
solutions, thereby improving the effectiveness of cross-question method reuse.

Abstract: Text embedding models are widely used in natural language processing
applications. However, their capability is often benchmarked on tasks that do
not require understanding nuanced numerical information in text. As a result,
it remains unclear whether current embedding models can precisely encode
numerical content, such as numbers, into embeddings. This question is critical
because embedding models are increasingly applied in domains where numbers
matter, such as finance and healthcare. For example, Company X's market share
grew by 2\% should be interpreted very differently from Company X's market
share grew by 20\%, even though both indicate growth in market share. This
study aims to examine whether text embedding models can capture such nuances.
Using synthetic data in a financial context, we evaluate 13 widely used text
embedding models and find that they generally struggle to capture numerical
details accurately. Our further analyses provide deeper insights into embedding
numeracy, informing future research to strengthen embedding model-based NLP
systems with improved capacity for handling numerical content.

availability of digital text, including more than 1.3 million articles on
Wikipedia, it is considered a middle-resource language. However, this label
quickly crumbles when the situation is examined more closely. We focus on three
subjective tasks (Sentiment Analysis, Emotion Analysis, and Toxicity Detection)
and find significant challenges in data availability and quality, despite the
overall increase in data availability. We review 110 publications on subjective
tasks in Farsi and observe a lack of publicly available datasets. Furthermore,
existing datasets often lack essential demographic factors, such as age and
gender, that are crucial for accurately modeling subjectivity in language. When
evaluating prediction models using the few available datasets, the results are
highly unstable across both datasets and models. Our findings indicate that the
volume of data is insufficient to significantly improve a language's prospects
in NLP.

TL;DR: 量子自然语言处理(QNLP)新方法，提出QCSE预训练量子上下文敏感嵌入模型，利用量子计算特性学习语言上下文关系


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用量子计算的特有性质来编码和理解自然语言的复杂性，并为低资源语言提供替代方案

Method: 提出4种上下文矩阵计算方法（指数衰减、正弦调制、相位移、哈希变换），构建QCSE模型在量子计算机上实现上下文敏感嵌入

Result: 在Fulani语言（低资源非洲语言）和英语语料上评估，QCSE能够捐捕上下文敏感性，利用量子系统表达力来表示丰富的上下文语言信息

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了量子计算在NLP中的强大潜力，为应用QNLP解决真实世界语言挑战打开了新途径

Abstract: Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP) offers a novel approach to
encoding and understanding the complexity of natural languages through the
power of quantum computation. This paper presents a pretrained quantum
context-sensitive embedding model, called QCSE, that captures context-sensitive
word embeddings, leveraging the unique properties of quantum systems to learn
contextual relationships in languages. The model introduces quantum-native
context learning, enabling the utilization of quantum computers for linguistic
tasks. Central to the proposed approach are innovative context matrix
computation methods, designed to create unique, representations of words based
on their surrounding linguistic context. Five distinct methods are proposed and
tested for computing the context matrices, incorporating techniques such as
exponential decay, sinusoidal modulation, phase shifts, and hash-based
transformations. These methods ensure that the quantum embeddings retain
context sensitivity, thereby making them suitable for downstream language tasks
where the expressibility and properties of quantum systems are valuable
resources. To evaluate the effectiveness of the model and the associated
context matrix methods, evaluations are conducted on both a Fulani corpus, a
low-resource African language, dataset of small size and an English corpus of
slightly larger size. The results demonstrate that QCSE not only captures
context sensitivity but also leverages the expressibility of quantum systems
for representing rich, context-aware language information. The use of Fulani
further highlights the potential of QNLP to mitigate the problem of lack of
data for this category of languages. This work underscores the power of quantum
computation in natural language processing (NLP) and opens new avenues for
applying QNLP to real-world linguistic challenges across various tasks and
domains.

TL;DR: VeriFact-CoT是一种新方法，通过事实验证-反思-引用整合的多阶段机制，解决LLM在生成复杂事实敏感内容时的幻觉和缺乏可信引用问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在生成复杂事实敏感内容时普遍存在的幻觉问题和缺乏可信引用来源的问题，提高生成内容的客观准确性、可信度和可追溯性。

Method: 采用多阶段机制：事实验证-反思-引用整合，使LLM能够批判性地自我检查和修订其中间推理步骤和最终答案。

Result: 显著提高了生成输出的客观准确性、可信度和可追溯性。

Conclusion: VeriFact-CoT使LLM在需要高保真度的应用场景（如科学研究、新闻报道和法律咨询）中更加可靠。

Abstract: This research introduces VeriFact-CoT (Verified Factual Chain-of-Thought), a
novel method designed to address the pervasive issues of hallucination and the
absence of credible citation sources in Large Language Models (LLMs) when
generating complex, fact-sensitive content. By incorporating a multi-stage
mechanism of 'fact verification-reflection-citation integration,' VeriFact-CoT
empowers LLMs to critically self-examine and revise their intermediate
reasoning steps and final answers. This process significantly enhances the
objective accuracy, trustworthiness, and traceability of the generated outputs,
making LLMs more reliable for applications demanding high fidelity such as
scientific research, news reporting, and legal consultation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LatinX是一个多语言文本转语音模型，用于语音到语音翻译，能够跨语言保持源说话人身份。该模型采用三阶段训练方法，包括预训练、监督微调和DPO对齐，在英语和罗曼语系语言上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个能够在语音到语音翻译过程中保持源说话人身份的多语言TTS模型，解决跨语言语音转换中的说话人身份保持问题。

Method: 使用12层仅解码器Transformer，采用三阶段训练：1）文本到音频映射的预训练；2）零样本语音克隆的监督微调；3）基于WER和说话人相似度指标的DPO对齐。

Result: LatinX模型在DPO训练后持续降低WER并提高客观相似度。人工评估显示其感知说话人相似度优于强基线XTTSv2，但揭示了客观与主观度量之间的差距。

Conclusion: LatinX在多语言语音转换中有效保持说话人身份，未来工作需要平衡偏好信号和开发低延迟架构。

Abstract: We present LatinX, a multilingual text-to-speech (TTS) model for cascaded
speech-to-speech translation that preserves the source speaker's identity
across languages. LatinX is a 12-layer decoder-only Transformer trained in
three stages: (i) pre-training for text-to-audio mapping, (ii) supervised
fine-tuning for zero-shot voice cloning, and (iii) alignment with Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) using automatically labeled pairs based on Word
Error Rate (WER) and speaker-similarity metrics. Trained on English and Romance
languages with emphasis on Portuguese, LatinX with DPO consistently reduces WER
and improves objective similarity over the fine-tuned baseline. Human
evaluations further indicate stronger perceived speaker similarity than a
strong baseline (XTTSv2), revealing gaps between objective and subjective
measures. We provide cross-lingual analyses and discuss balanced preference
signals and lower-latency architectures as future work.

TL;DR: 提出了ZhiFangDanTai框架，结合图检索增强生成(GraphRAG)与LLM微调，用于中医药方生成任务，解决了现有模型输出深度不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统中医药方在治疗流行病和复杂疾病中发挥重要作用，但现有模型缺乏完整的方剂组成和详细解释，且现有数据集细节不足，限制了模型输出的深度。

Method: 提出ZhiFangDanTai框架，使用GraphRAG检索和合成结构化中医药知识为简洁摘要，同时构建增强的指令数据集来提高LLM整合检索信息的能力。

Result: 在收集和临床数据集上的实验结果表明，ZhiFangDanTai相比最先进模型取得了显著改进，并提供了理论证明表明该方法可以减少泛化误差和幻觉率。

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合GraphRAG和微调技术，有效提升了中医药方生成任务的性能，模型已开源。

Abstract: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) formulas play a significant role in
treating epidemics and complex diseases. Existing models for TCM utilize
traditional algorithms or deep learning techniques to analyze formula
relationships, yet lack comprehensive results, such as complete formula
compositions and detailed explanations. Although recent efforts have used TCM
instruction datasets to fine-tune Large Language Models (LLMs) for explainable
formula generation, existing datasets lack sufficient details, such as the
roles of the formula's sovereign, minister, assistant, courier; efficacy;
contraindications; tongue and pulse diagnosis-limiting the depth of model
outputs. To address these challenges, we propose ZhiFangDanTai, a framework
combining Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) with LLM
fine-tuning. ZhiFangDanTai uses GraphRAG to retrieve and synthesize structured
TCM knowledge into concise summaries, while also constructing an enhanced
instruction dataset to improve LLMs' ability to integrate retrieved
information. Furthermore, we provide novel theoretical proofs demonstrating
that integrating GraphRAG with fine-tuning techniques can reduce generalization
error and hallucination rates in the TCM formula task. Experimental results on
both collected and clinical datasets demonstrate that ZhiFangDanTai achieves
significant improvements over state-of-the-art models. Our model is
open-sourced at https://huggingface.co/tczzx6/ZhiFangDanTai1.0.

Motivation: 解决LLM生成临床文本事实准确性评估的难题，因为专家评审无法满足持续质量保证的可扩展性需求。

Method: 1) MedFactEval框架：临床医生定义关键事实，通过多LLM多数投票评估生成摘要中的事实包含情况；2) MedAgentBrief：模型无关的多步骤工作流程生成高质量出院摘要。

Result: MedFactEval LLM评审团与七名医生专家组的评估结果达到几乎完美一致（Cohen's kappa=81%），统计上不劣于单个人类专家（kappa=67%，P<0.001）。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了稳健的评估框架和高性能生成工作流程，为生成式AI在临床工作流程中的负责任部署提供了全面方法。

Abstract: Evaluating factual accuracy in Large Language Model (LLM)-generated clinical
text is a critical barrier to adoption, as expert review is unscalable for the
continuous quality assurance these systems require. We address this challenge
with two complementary contributions. First, we introduce MedFactEval, a
framework for scalable, fact-grounded evaluation where clinicians define
high-salience key facts and an "LLM Jury"--a multi-LLM majority vote--assesses
their inclusion in generated summaries. Second, we present MedAgentBrief, a
model-agnostic, multi-step workflow designed to generate high-quality, factual
discharge summaries. To validate our evaluation framework, we established a
gold-standard reference using a seven-physician majority vote on
clinician-defined key facts from inpatient cases. The MedFactEval LLM Jury
achieved almost perfect agreement with this panel (Cohen's kappa=81%), a
performance statistically non-inferior to that of a single human expert
(kappa=67%, P < 0.001). Our work provides both a robust evaluation framework
(MedFactEval) and a high-performing generation workflow (MedAgentBrief),
offering a comprehensive approach to advance the responsible deployment of
generative AI in clinical workflows.

TL;DR: 本文研究了不同对齐方法对LLM代理在多轮多方协作中作为合作伙伴有效性的影响，特别关注摩擦代理在促进团队反思和决策方面的作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型越来越多地作为人类'协作者'集成到各种工作流程中，需要确保其在多轮交互中的行为可预测且可靠。现有的对齐技术通常在简化单用户设置下开发，未能考虑长期多方互动的动态特性。

Method: 采用角色扮演方法，评估不同训练方式的摩擦代理在协作任务对话中的干预效果。提出了一个新颖的反事实评估框架，量化摩擦干预如何改变团队协作轨迹和信念对齐。

Result: 结果显示，摩擦感知方法在帮助团队达成共识（共同认可的任务相关命题）和任务结果正确性方面显著优于常见的对齐基线方法。

Conclusion: 摩擦感知的对齐方法能够有效提升LLM代理在多轮多方协作中的表现，促进更好的团队决策和共识形成。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) integrate into diverse workflows, they are
increasingly being considered "collaborators" with humans. If such AI
collaborators are to be reliable, their behavior over multiturn interactions
must be predictable, validated and verified before deployment. Common alignment
techniques are typically developed under simplified single-user settings and do
not account for the dynamics of long-horizon multiparty interactions. This
paper examines how different alignment methods affect LLM agents' effectiveness
as partners in multiturn, multiparty collaborations. We study this question
through the lens of friction agents that intervene in group dialogues to
encourage the collaborative group to slow down and reflect upon their reasoning
for deliberative decision-making. Using a roleplay methodology, we evaluate
interventions from differently-trained friction agents in collaborative task
conversations. We propose a novel counterfactual evaluation framework that
quantifies how friction interventions change the trajectory of group
collaboration and belief alignment. Our results show that a friction-aware
approach significantly outperforms common alignment baselines in helping both
convergence to a common ground, or agreed-upon task-relevant propositions, and
correctness of task outcomes.

TL;DR: 通过从粗细到细的三级语义相关性聚合执行，准确识别并集成最相关的偏置信息，解决了偏置列表长度变化对跨注意力模型性能的影响


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨注意力基于上下文ASR模型在识别个性化偏置短语方面取得显著进步，但效果受偏置信息量变化影响，特别是偏置列表长度大幅增加时

Method: 提出净化语义相关性聚合建模(PSC-Joint)方法，定义并计算ASR中间表征与偏置信息之间的三级语义相关性：列表级、短语级和标记级，通过聚合建模获得交集结果，并使用基于分组竞争策略的净化机制过滤无关偏置短语

Result: 在AISHELL-1和KeSpeech数据集上，相比基线方法，PSC-Joint在不同长度偏置列表上实现了平均相对F1分数提升21.34%和28.46%的收益

Conclusion: 通过多级语义相关性聚合建模和净化机制，能够有效减少偏置信息量变化对上下文ASR模型性能的影响，提升个性化语音识别的准确性和稳定性

Abstract: Recently, cross-attention-based contextual automatic speech recognition (ASR)
models have made notable advancements in recognizing personalized biasing
phrases. However, the effectiveness of cross-attention is affected by
variations in biasing information volume, especially when the length of the
biasing list increases significantly. We find that, regardless of the length of
the biasing list, only a limited amount of biasing information is most relevant
to a specific ASR intermediate representation. Therefore, by identifying and
integrating the most relevant biasing information rather than the entire
biasing list, we can alleviate the effects of variations in biasing information
volume for contextual ASR. To this end, we propose a purified semantic
correlation joint modeling (PSC-Joint) approach. In PSC-Joint, we define and
calculate three semantic correlations between the ASR intermediate
representations and biasing information from coarse to fine: list-level,
phrase-level, and token-level. Then, the three correlations are jointly modeled
to produce their intersection, so that the most relevant biasing information
across various granularities is highlighted and integrated for contextual
recognition. In addition, to reduce the computational cost introduced by the
joint modeling of three semantic correlations, we also propose a purification
mechanism based on a grouped-and-competitive strategy to filter out irrelevant
biasing phrases. Compared with baselines, our PSC-Joint approach achieves
average relative F1 score improvements of up to 21.34% on AISHELL-1 and 28.46%
on KeSpeech, across biasing lists of varying lengths.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型计算成本高，虽然早期退出等调适性计算方法能节省计算，但在批处理推理中反而导致系统瓶颈，降低吞吐量

Method: 提出高效并行解码机制消除过高开销，采用深度参数共享架构减轻同步问题，预训练轻量路由器动态分配最优递归深度

Result: 建立了效率与性能之间的新帕約托前沿，在单个模型中同时优化了调适性计算和参数效率

Conclusion: 通过算法与架构的协同设计，成功解决了动态计算与系统效率的冲突，为大语言模型的实际部署提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable capabilities, but their
practical deployment is hindered by significant computational costs. While
adaptive computation methods like early-exiting promise to reduce these costs,
they introduce a fundamental conflict: the per-token dynamism intended to save
computation often creates system-level bottlenecks that can paradoxically
reduce throughput in batched inference. This dissertation resolves this
conflict by co-designing adaptive algorithms and model architectures to strike
an optimal balance between dynamism and efficiency. To this end, our work first
addresses critical sources of overhead in conventional early-exiting by
proposing an efficient parallel decoding mechanism. We then show that deep
parameter sharing provides an architectural foundation that not only yields
compact, parameter-efficient models but also inherently mitigates the critical
synchronization issues affecting dynamic inference. Finally, this work presents
a unified framework where lightweight routers are pretrained to dynamically
assign an optimal recursion depth for each token. This approach establishes a
new Pareto frontier between efficiency and performance by effectively
optimizing for both adaptive computation and parameter efficiency within a
single model.

TL;DR: KatotohananQA是TruthfulQA基准的菲律宾语翻译版本，用于评估LLM在低资源语言中的真实性表现。研究发现英语和菲律宾语之间存在显著性能差距，新OpenAI模型展现较强多语言鲁棒性，但不同问题类型存在差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型容易产生幻觉，现有真实性评估基准主要针对英语，缺乏对低资源语言的评估，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 将TruthfulQA基准翻译成菲律宾语(KatotohananQA)，使用二元选择框架评估7个免费专有模型，比较英语和菲律宾语版本的表现。

Result: 发现英语和菲律宾语真实性表现存在显著差距，GPT-5和GPT-5 mini展现较强多语言鲁棒性，不同问题类型、类别和主题的跨语言迁移鲁棒性存在差异。

Conclusion: 需要进行更广泛的多语言评估以确保LLM使用的公平性和可靠性，某些问题类型在多语言迁移中表现较弱，需要特别关注。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance across various
tasks, but their tendency to produce hallucinations limits reliable adoption.
Benchmarks such as TruthfulQA have been developed to measure truthfulness, yet
they are primarily available in English, leaving a gap in evaluating LLMs in
low-resource languages. To address this, we present KatotohananQA, a Filipino
translation of the TruthfulQA benchmark. Seven free-tier proprietary models
were assessed using a binary-choice framework. Findings show a significant
performance gap between English and Filipino truthfulness, with newer OpenAI
models (GPT-5 and GPT-5 mini) demonstrating strong multilingual robustness.
Results also reveal disparities across question characteristics, suggesting
that some question types, categories, and topics are less robust to
multilingual transfer which highlight the need for broader multilingual
evaluation to ensure fairness and reliability in LLM usage.

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注话语级别的交互特征，忽略了多模态对话历史中词级别的细粒度语义和韵律知识，导致对话韵律表达不够自然。

Method: 构建两个多模态细粒度对话交互图（语义交互图和韵律交互图），编码词级别语义、韵律及其对后续话语的影响，利用这些交互特征增强合成语音的对话韵律。

Result: 在DailyTalk数据集上的实验表明，MFCIG-CSS在韵律表现力方面优于所有基线模型。

Conclusion: 提出的细粒度交互图方法能有效提升对话语音合成的韵律自然度，证明了词级别多模态交互建模的重要性。

Abstract: Conversational Speech Synthesis (CSS) aims to generate speech with natural
prosody by understanding the multimodal dialogue history (MDH). The latest work
predicts the accurate prosody expression of the target utterance by modeling
the utterance-level interaction characteristics of MDH and the target
utterance. However, MDH contains fine-grained semantic and prosody knowledge at
the word level. Existing methods overlook the fine-grained semantic and
prosodic interaction modeling. To address this gap, we propose MFCIG-CSS, a
novel Multimodal Fine-grained Context Interaction Graph-based CSS system. Our
approach constructs two specialized multimodal fine-grained dialogue
interaction graphs: a semantic interaction graph and a prosody interaction
graph. These two interaction graphs effectively encode interactions between
word-level semantics, prosody, and their influence on subsequent utterances in
MDH. The encoded interaction features are then leveraged to enhance synthesized
speech with natural conversational prosody. Experiments on the DailyTalk
dataset demonstrate that MFCIG-CSS outperforms all baseline models in terms of
prosodic expressiveness. Code and speech samples are available at

Motivation: 直观到LLM参数空间具有几何结构，而传统的加性精调方式会突破这种本质几何结构，限制了性能。需要在保持参数几何结构的同时应用正交约束。

Method: 提出OLieRA方法：1）引入李群理论到LLM微调中；2）采用乘性更新方式保持参数几何结构；3）在任务子空间中应用正交约束来减少任务干扰。

Result: 实验结果显示OLieRA在标准连续学习测试集上达到了最高水平，并在大量任务设置中保持了顶级性能。

Conclusion: 通过结合李群理论的乘性更新和正交约束，OLieRA能够有效保持LLM参数的几何结构，显著提升了多任务连续学习的性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are prone to catastrophic forgetting in
sequential multi-task settings. Parameter regularization methods such as O-LoRA
and N-LoRA alleviate task interference by enforcing low-rank subspace
orthogonality, but they overlook the fact that conventional additive
fine-tuning disrupts the intrinsic geometric structure of LLM parameters,
limiting performance. Our key insight is that the parameter space of LLMs
possesses a geometric structure, which must be preserved in addition to
enforcing orthogonality. Based on this, we propose Orthogonal Low-rank
Adaptation in Lie Groups (OLieRA), which introduces Lie group theory into LLM
fine-tuning: leveraging multiplicative updates to preserve parameter geometry
while applying orthogonality constraints to task subspaces. Experiments
demonstrate that OLieRA achieves state-of-the-art results on the Standard CL
benchmark and remains among the top-performing methods in the Large Number of
Tasks setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了评估大型语言模型在政治敏感语境中的表现，特别是在涉及性别、政治立场等敏感因素时的公平性和准确性，需要构建一个包含丰富元数据的基准数据集。

Method: 构建EuroParlVote数据集，链接欧洲议会辩论演讲与投票结果，包含议员性别、年龄、国家和政治团体等元数据。在性别分类和投票预测两个任务上评估最先进的LLM。

Result: 发现LLM经常将女性议员错误分类为男性，在模拟女性演讲者投票时准确性降低；政治立场上偏向中间派，在极左和极右团体上表现较差；GPT-4o等专有模型在鲁棒性和公平性上优于开源模型。

Conclusion: LLM在政治敏感语境中存在系统性偏见，需要更多研究来提升NLP在政治语境中的公平性和问责性。EuroParlVote数据集、代码和演示已发布以支持未来研究。

Abstract: We introduce EuroParlVote, a novel benchmark for evaluating large language
models (LLMs) in politically sensitive contexts. It links European Parliament
debate speeches to roll-call vote outcomes and includes rich demographic
metadata for each Member of the European Parliament (MEP), such as gender, age,
country, and political group. Using EuroParlVote, we evaluate state-of-the-art
LLMs on two tasks -- gender classification and vote prediction -- revealing
consistent patterns of bias. We find that LLMs frequently misclassify female
MEPs as male and demonstrate reduced accuracy when simulating votes for female
speakers. Politically, LLMs tend to favor centrist groups while underperforming
on both far-left and far-right ones. Proprietary models like GPT-4o outperform
open-weight alternatives in terms of both robustness and fairness. We release
the EuroParlVote dataset, code, and demo to support future research on fairness
and accountability in NLP within political contexts.

TL;DR: 本文研究了合成数据在文本嵌入模型中的作用，发现其改进效果有限且存在任务间的性能权衡，挑战了合成数据能提高模型泛化能力的观点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前通用文本嵌入模型的发展依赖于合成LLM生成数据，但缺乏公开可用的合成数据集阻碍了对其泛化作用的研究。

Method: 首先复现并公开了Wang等人提出的合成数据，然后系统分析了合成数据在哪些具体方面改善模型泛化性能。

Result: 合成数据带来的性能改进是稀疏且高度局域化的，存在任务间的性能权衡，某些任务的改进可能导致其他任务性能下降。

Conclusion: 当前合成数据方法在构建通用嵌入模型方面存在局限性，训练合成数据并不一定能带来跨任务的更鲁棒嵌入模型。

Abstract: Recent progress in developing general purpose text embedders has been driven
by training on ever-growing corpora of synthetic LLM-generated data.
Nonetheless, no publicly available synthetic dataset exists, posing a barrier
to studying its role for generalization. To address this issue, we first
reproduce and publicly release the synthetic data proposed by Wang et al.
(Mistral-E5). Our synthetic data is high quality and leads to consistent
improvements in performance. Next, we critically examine where exactly
synthetic data improves model generalization. Our analysis reveals that
benefits from synthetic data are sparse and highly localized to individual
datasets. Moreover, we observe trade-offs between the performance on different
categories and data that benefits one task, degrades performance on another.
Our findings highlight the limitations of current synthetic data approaches for
building general-purpose embedders and challenge the notion that training on
synthetic data leads to more robust embedding models across tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to recruitment automation. Large
Language Models (LLMs) were fine-tuned to improve accuracy and efficiency.
Building upon our previous work on the Multilayer Large Language Model-Based
Robotic Process Automation Applicant Tracking (MLAR) system . This work
introduces a novel methodology. Training fine-tuned LLMs specifically tuned for
recruitment tasks. The proposed framework addresses the limitations of generic
LLMs by creating a synthetic dataset that uses a standardized JSON format. This
helps ensure consistency and scalability. In addition to the synthetic data
set, the resumes were parsed using DeepSeek, a high-parameter LLM. The resumes
were parsed into the same structured JSON format and placed in the training
set. This will help improve data diversity and realism. Through
experimentation, we demonstrate significant improvements in performance
metrics, such as exact match, F1 score, BLEU score, ROUGE score, and overall
similarity compared to base models and other state-of-the-art LLMs. In
particular, the fine-tuned Phi-4 model achieved the highest F1 score of 90.62%,
indicating exceptional precision and recall in recruitment tasks. This study
highlights the potential of fine-tuned LLMs. Furthermore, it will revolutionize
recruitment workflows by providing more accurate candidate-job matching.

TL;DR: 提出Mask-GCG方法，通过学习性令牌掩码识别后缀中的关键令牌，减少冗余度并提高盗码攻击效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的GCG盗码攻击方法都使用固定长度后缀，但后缀中存在冗余令牌的问题未得到充分研究

Method: 使用学习性令牌掩码技术，识别高影响力令牌位置并增加其更新概率，同时剥除低影响力令牌位置

Result: 实验结果显示后缀中大部分令牌对攻击成功有重要贡献，剥除少数低影响力令牌不会影响攻击成功率，揭示了令牌冗余性

Conclusion: Mask-GCG方法能够有效减少计算开销并缩短攻击时间，为发展高效和可解释的大语言模型提供了新视角

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks on Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated various
successful methods whereby attackers manipulate models into generating harmful
responses that they are designed to avoid. Among these, Greedy Coordinate
Gradient (GCG) has emerged as a general and effective approach that optimizes
the tokens in a suffix to generate jailbreakable prompts. While several
improved variants of GCG have been proposed, they all rely on fixed-length
suffixes. However, the potential redundancy within these suffixes remains
unexplored. In this work, we propose Mask-GCG, a plug-and-play method that
employs learnable token masking to identify impactful tokens within the suffix.
Our approach increases the update probability for tokens at high-impact
positions while pruning those at low-impact positions. This pruning not only
reduces redundancy but also decreases the size of the gradient space, thereby
lowering computational overhead and shortening the time required to achieve
successful attacks compared to GCG. We evaluate Mask-GCG by applying it to the
original GCG and several improved variants. Experimental results show that most
tokens in the suffix contribute significantly to attack success, and pruning a
minority of low-impact tokens does not affect the loss values or compromise the
attack success rate (ASR), thereby revealing token redundancy in LLM prompts.
Our findings provide insights for developing efficient and interpretable LLMs
from the perspective of jailbreak attacks.

*Ao Chang,Yubo Chen,Jun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PL-CA提出参数化RAG框架，将法律知识编码为参数向量并集成到LLM的前馈网络中，缓解上下文压力，同时构建专家标注的多任务法律数据集验证效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG方法直接将检索文档注入模型上下文，受限于有限的上下文窗口，导致计算开销大、注意力分散，且现有基准缺乏专家标注和真实多任务场景，无法反映模型真实能力。

Method: 提出参数化RAG（P-RAG）框架，对语料知识进行数据增强并编码为参数向量，通过LoRA将参数化知识集成到LLM的前馈网络中。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在减少长上下文开销的同时，在下游任务上保持与传统RAG相当的竞争性能。

Conclusion: PL-CA通过参数化知识集成有效缓解了模型上下文压力，为法律领域的高知识严谨性需求提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Conventional RAG is considered one of the most effective methods for
addressing model knowledge insufficiency and hallucination, particularly in the
judicial domain that requires high levels of knowledge rigor, logical
consistency, and content integrity. However, the conventional RAG method only
injects retrieved documents directly into the model's context, which severely
constrains models due to their limited context windows and introduces
additional computational overhead through excessively long contexts, thereby
disrupting models' attention and degrading performance on downstream tasks.
Moreover, many existing benchmarks lack expert annotation and focus solely on
individual downstream tasks while real-world legal scenarios consist of
multiple mixed legal tasks, indicating conventional benchmarks' inadequacy for
reflecting models' true capabilities. To address these limitations, we propose
PL-CA, which introduces a parametric RAG (P-RAG) framework to perform data
augmentation on corpus knowledge and encode this legal knowledge into
parametric vectors, and then integrates this parametric knowledge into the
LLM's feed-forward networks (FFN) via LoRA, thereby alleviating models' context
pressure. Additionally, we also construct a multi-task legal dataset comprising
more than 2000 training and test instances, which are all expert-annotated and
manually verified. We conduct our experiments on our dataset, and the
experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces the overhead
associated with excessively long contexts while maintaining competitive
performance on downstream tasks compared to conventional RAG. Our code and
dataset are provided in the appendix.

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型的多语言常识生成能力，通过MULTICOM基准测试评估了多个开源LLM在英语、西班牙语、荷兰语和瓦伦西亚语上的表现，发现英语表现最佳，资源较少语言表现较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在多语言环境下的常识生成能力，填补现有研究在多语言常识生成评估方面的空白。

Method: 构建MULTICOM基准测试（基于COCOTEROS数据集扩展到四种语言），评估LLaMA、Qwen、Gemma、EuroLLM和Salamandra等开源模型，结合自动指标、LLM-as-a-judge方法和人工标注进行综合评估。

Result: 英语表现最优，资源较少语言（西班牙语、荷兰语、瓦伦西亚语）表现显著较差；上下文支持对资源较少语言有一定帮助但效果不一。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在多语言常识生成方面存在明显局限性，特别是在资源较少的语言上表现不佳，需要进一步改进。

Abstract: This paper explores the multilingual commonsense generation abilities of
Large Language Models (LLMs). To facilitate this investigation, we introduce
MULTICOM, a novel benchmark that extends the COCOTEROS dataset to four
languages: English, Spanish, Dutch, and Valencian. The task involves generating
a commonsensical sentence that includes a given triplet of words. We evaluate a
range of open-source LLMs, including LLaMA, Qwen, Gemma, EuroLLM, and
Salamandra, on this benchmark. Our evaluation combines automatic metrics,
LLM-as-a-judge approaches (using Prometheus and JudgeLM), and human
annotations. Results consistently show superior performance in English, with
significantly lower performance in less-resourced languages. While contextual
support yields mixed results, it tends to benefit underrepresented languages.
These findings underscore the current limitations of LLMs in multilingual
commonsense generation. The dataset is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源网络代理在复杂任务上的信息搜索能力有限或缺乏透明实现，主要挑战在于缺乏具有挑战性的信息搜索数据。

Method: 采用模型驱动的探索和迭代式长到短查询演化方法生成高质量训练数据，通过监督微调后接强化学习训练WebExplorer-8B模型。

Result: WebExplorer-8B在多个信息搜索基准测试中达到最先进性能，在BrowseComp-en/zh上超越WebSailor-72B，在WebWalkerQA和FRAMES上达到100B参数以下模型最佳性能，平均搜索16轮后仍能保持高精度。

Conclusion: 该方法为长视野网络代理提供了实用路径，模型不仅在信息搜索任务上表现优异，还在HLE基准测试上展现出强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: The paradigm of Large Language Models (LLMs) has increasingly shifted toward
agentic applications, where web browsing capabilities are fundamental for
retrieving information from diverse online sources. However, existing
open-source web agents either demonstrate limited information-seeking abilities
on complex tasks or lack transparent implementations. In this work, we identify
that the key challenge lies in the scarcity of challenging data for information
seeking. To address this limitation, we introduce WebExplorer: a systematic
data generation approach using model-based exploration and iterative,
long-to-short query evolution. This method creates challenging query-answer
pairs that require multi-step reasoning and complex web navigation. By
leveraging our curated high-quality dataset, we successfully develop advanced
web agent WebExplorer-8B through supervised fine-tuning followed by
reinforcement learning. Our model supports 128K context length and up to 100
tool calling turns, enabling long-horizon problem solving. Across diverse
information-seeking benchmarks, WebExplorer-8B achieves the state-of-the-art
performance at its scale. Notably, as an 8B-sized model, WebExplorer-8B is able
to effectively search over an average of 16 turns after RL training, achieving
higher accuracy than WebSailor-72B on BrowseComp-en/zh and attaining the best
performance among models up to 100B parameters on WebWalkerQA and FRAMES.
Beyond these information-seeking tasks, our model also achieves strong
generalization on the HLE benchmark even though it is only trained on
knowledge-intensive QA data. These results highlight our approach as a
practical path toward long-horizon web agents.

TL;DR: 这篇论文探索了Transformer模型中使用非均匀层结构，通过层次缩放技术重新分配FFN宽度和注意力头数，在固定参数预算下实现更好性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer模型使用均匀层大小，忽视了不同深度层在功能角色和计算需求上的差异性。

Method: 提出三种层次缩放变体（Framed、Reverse、Crown），通过二点或三点线性插值重新分配FFN宽度和注意力头数，在180M参数和5B标签上进行预训练。

Result: 所有模型都收敛到相似损失值，且都比等成本的均匀基线模型表现更好，而训练速度没有显著下降。

Conclusion: 这是预训练阶段层次架构设计的初步探索，未来需要在更大规模的标签和参数上扩展实验以全面评估其潜力。

Abstract: Transformer-based language models traditionally use uniform (isotropic) layer
sizes, yet they ignore the diverse functional roles that different depths can
play and their computational capacity needs. Building on Layer-Wise Scaling
(LWS) and pruning literature, we introduce three new LWS variants - Framed,
Reverse, and Crown - that redistribute FFN widths and attention heads via two
or three-point linear interpolation in the pre-training stage. We present the
first systematic ablation of LWS and its variants, on a fixed budget of 180M
parameters, trained on 5B tokens. All models converge to similar losses and
achieve better performance compared to an equal-cost isotropic baseline,
without a substantial decrease in training throughput. This work represents an
initial step into the design space of layer-wise architectures for
pre-training, but future work should scale experiments to orders of magnitude
more tokens and parameters to fully assess their potential.

TL;DR: LAMDAS是一种利用预训练LLM作为隐式分类器的数据选择方法，通过将数据选择重构为单类分类问题，仅使用少量参考数据就能高效筛选高质量领域数据，在性能和计算效率方面都优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 领域适配LLM面临高质量人工标注数据稀缺的瓶颈，大量未筛选数据直接用于微调会引入噪声导致性能下降。现有数据选择方法难以同时达到准确性和效率的要求。

Method: 提出LAMDAS方法，将预训练LLM本身作为隐式分类器，避免显式特征工程和计算密集型优化过程。将数据选择重构为单类分类问题，通过小规模参考数据集识别属于目标领域的候选数据。

Result: 实验结果表明，LAMDAS仅使用少量数据就能超越全数据训练的性能，在多种场景下优于9个SOTA基线方法，在性能提升和计算效率之间达到了最佳平衡。

Conclusion: LAMDAS提供了一种准确高效的数据选择解决方案，成功解决了领域适配中的数据稀缺和质量问题，为LLM的领域专业化提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Adapting large language models (LLMs) to specific domains often faces a
critical bottleneck: the scarcity of high-quality, human-curated data. While
large volumes of unchecked data are readily available, indiscriminately using
them for fine-tuning risks introducing noise and degrading performance.
Strategic data selection is thus crucial, requiring a method that is both
accurate and efficient. Existing approaches, categorized as similarity-based
and direct optimization methods, struggle to simultaneously achieve these
goals. In this paper, we introduce LAMDAS (LLM As an iMplicit classifier for
domain-specific DAta Selection), a novel approach that leverages the
pre-trained LLM itself as an implicit classifier, thereby bypassing explicit
feature engineering and computationally intensive optimization process. LAMDAS
reframes data selection as a one-class classification problem, identifying
candidate data that "belongs" to the target domain defined by a small reference
dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that LAMDAS not only
exceeds the performance of full-data training using a fraction of the data but
also outperforms nine state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines under various
scenarios. Furthermore, LAMDAS achieves the most compelling balance between
performance gains and computational efficiency compared to all evaluated
baselines.

TL;DR: SLiNT是一个结构感知的语言模型框架，通过注入知识图谱结构信息和对比学习来解决链接预测中的结构稀疏性和语义模糊性问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在知识图谱链接预测中虽然具有强大的生成推理能力，但对结构信号的利用有限，导致结构稀疏和语义模糊问题，特别是在不完整或零样本设置下

Method: 提出SLiNT框架：1) Structure-Guided Neighborhood Enhancement (SGNE) 检索伪邻居丰富稀疏实体；2) Dynamic Hard Contrastive Learning (DHCL) 通过插值硬正负样本来解决实体级模糊性；3) Gradient-Decoupled Dual Injection (GDDI) 进行token级结构感知干预，同时保持核心LLM参数

Result: 在WN18RR和FB15k-237数据集上的实验表明，SLiNT相比基于嵌入和基于生成的基线方法取得了优越或竞争性的性能

Conclusion: 该方法证明了结构感知表示学习对于可扩展知识图谱补全的有效性

Abstract: Link prediction in knowledge graphs requires integrating structural
information and semantic context to infer missing entities. While large
language models offer strong generative reasoning capabilities, their limited
exploitation of structural signals often results in structural sparsity and
semantic ambiguity, especially under incomplete or zero-shot settings. To
address these challenges, we propose SLiNT (Structure-aware Language model with
Injection and coNtrastive Training), a modular framework that injects
knowledge-graph-derived structural context into a frozen LLM backbone with
lightweight LoRA-based adaptation for robust link prediction. Specifically,
Structure-Guided Neighborhood Enhancement (SGNE) retrieves pseudo-neighbors to
enrich sparse entities and mitigate missing context; Dynamic Hard Contrastive
Learning (DHCL) introduces fine-grained supervision by interpolating hard
positives and negatives to resolve entity-level ambiguity; and
Gradient-Decoupled Dual Injection (GDDI) performs token-level structure-aware
intervention while preserving the core LLM parameters. Experiments on WN18RR
and FB15k-237 show that SLiNT achieves superior or competitive performance
compared with both embedding-based and generation-based baselines,
demonstrating the effectiveness of structure-aware representation learning for
scalable knowledge graph completion.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HAVE是一个无需微调的参数自由解码框架，通过头自适应门控和值校准来解决LLM幻觉问题，在多个QA基准测试中有效减少幻觉并优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在检索增强生成长上下文生成中经常产生幻觉，即使相关证据存在。这源于两个问题：头重要性被视为输入无关的，原始注意力权重不能很好地反映每个token的真实贡献

Method: HAVE框架包含头自适应门控（实例级软重加权注意力头）和值校准（通过值向量大小增强注意力以近似写回贡献），通过轻量级不确定性缩放策略将token级证据与语言模型分布融合

Result: 在多个QA基准测试和LLM家族上的实验表明，HAVE持续减少幻觉并优于包括DAGCD在内的强基线方法，且开销适中

Conclusion: HAVE框架透明、可复现，可轻松集成到现成的LLM中，在现实场景中推进可信生成

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce hallucinations in
retrieval-augmented or long-context generation, even when relevant evidence is
present. This stems from two issues: head importance is treated as
input-agnostic, and raw attention weights poorly reflect each token's true
contribution. We present HAVE (Head-Adaptive Gating and ValuE Calibration), a
parameter-free decoding framework that directly addresses both challenges. HAVE
introduces head-adaptive gating, which performs instance-level soft reweighing
of attention heads, and value calibration, which augments attention with the
magnitude of value vectors to approximate write-back contribution. Together,
these modules construct token-level evidence aligned with model updates and
fuse it with the LM distribution through a lightweight uncertainty-scaled
policy. HAVE requires no finetuning and operates in a single forward pass,
making it efficient and broadly applicable. Experiments across multiple QA
benchmarks and LLM families demonstrate that HAVE consistently reduces
hallucinations and outperforms strong baselines, including DAGCD, with modest
overhead. The framework is transparent, reproducible, and readily integrates
with off-the-shelf LLMs, advancing trustworthy generation in real-world
settings.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into various applications has

and output quality, we provide insights into their performance and
applicability. Our findings reveal how multi-turn interactions influence guided
decoding, uncovering unexpected performance variations that can inform method
selection for specific use cases. This work advances the understanding of
structured output generation in RAG systems, offering both theoretical insights

Abstract: Intertextuality is a central tenet in literary studies. It refers to the
intricate links between literary texts that are created by various types of
references. This paper proposes a new quantitative model of intertextuality to
enable scalable analysis and network-based insights: perform pairwise
comparisons of the embeddings of n-grams from two texts and average their
results as the overall intertextuality. Validation on four texts with known
degrees of intertextuality, alongside a scalability test on 267 diverse texts,
demonstrates the method's effectiveness and efficiency. Network analysis
further reveals centrality and community structures, affirming the approach's
success in capturing and quantifying intertextual relationships.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems rely heavily on the retrieval
stage, particularly the coarse-ranking process. Existing coarse-ranking
optimization approaches often struggle to balance domain-specific knowledge
learning with query enhencement, resulting in suboptimal retrieval performance.
To address this challenge, we propose MoLER, a domain-aware RAG method that
uses MoL-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning to optimize retrieval. MoLER has a
two-stage pipeline: a continual pre-training (CPT) phase using a Mixture of
Losses (MoL) to balance domain-specific knowledge with general language
capabilities, and a reinforcement learning (RL) phase leveraging Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) to optimize query and passage generation for
maximizing document recall. A key innovation is our Multi-query Single-passage
Late Fusion (MSLF) strategy, which reduces computational overhead during RL
training while maintaining scalable inference via Multi-query Multi-passage
Late Fusion (MMLF). Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that MoLER
achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming baseline
methods. MoLER bridges the knowledge gap in RAG systems, enabling robust and
scalable retrieval in specialized domains.

Method: 基于教师-学生聊天室语料库构建IntrEx数据集，采用序列级标注和基于比较的评分方法，使用100多名二语学习者进行严格标注，并研究LLM预测人类趣味性判断的能力。

Result: 微调后的7B/8B参数LLM在预测趣味性方面表现优于GPT-4o等大型专有模型，证明了专门数据集在教育场景中建模参与度的潜力。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了具体性、可理解性和吸收度等语言认知因素对教育对话参与度的影响，为开发更吸引人的教育对话系统提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Engagement and motivation are crucial for second-language acquisition, yet
maintaining learner interest in educational conversations remains a challenge.
While prior research has explored what makes educational texts interesting,
still little is known about the linguistic features that drive engagement in
conversations. To address this gap, we introduce IntrEx, the first large
dataset annotated for interestingness and expected interestingness in
teacher-student interactions. Built upon the Teacher-Student Chatroom Corpus
(TSCC), IntrEx extends prior work by incorporating sequence-level annotations,
allowing for the study of engagement beyond isolated turns to capture how
interest evolves over extended dialogues. We employ a rigorous annotation
process with over 100 second-language learners, using a comparison-based rating
approach inspired by reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to
improve agreement. We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can
predict human interestingness judgments. We find that LLMs (7B/8B parameters)
fine-tuned on interestingness ratings outperform larger proprietary models like
GPT-4o, demonstrating the potential for specialised datasets to model
engagement in educational settings. Finally, we analyze how linguistic and
cognitive factors, such as concreteness, comprehensibility (readability), and
uptake, influence engagement in educational dialogues.

TL;DR: 该研究探索了识别论点中人类价值主观性的方法，发现直接主观性识别比通过价值预测推断主观性效果更好，能够有效识别存在不同解释的论点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 聚合多个标注为单一真实标签可能会掩盖标注者分歧的宝贵见解，特别是在主观性起关键作用的任务中。研究旨在识别论点中激励性人类价值的主观性。

Method: 评估了两种主要方法：通过价值预测推断主观性 vs 直接识别主观性。实验还测试了结合对比损失和二元交叉熵损失的方法。

Result: 直接主观性识别显著提高了标记主观论点的模型性能。结合对比损失和二元交叉熵损失虽然不能提高性能，但减少了对每个标签主观性的依赖。

Conclusion: 提出的方法可以帮助识别个体可能有不同解释的论点，促进更细致的标注过程。

Abstract: Aggregating multiple annotations into a single ground truth label may hide
valuable insights into annotator disagreement, particularly in tasks where
subjectivity plays a crucial role. In this work, we explore methods for
identifying subjectivity in recognizing the human values that motivate
arguments. We evaluate two main approaches: inferring subjectivity through
value prediction vs. directly identifying subjectivity. Our experiments show
that direct subjectivity identification significantly improves the model
performance of flagging subjective arguments. Furthermore, combining
contrastive loss with binary cross-entropy loss does not improve performance
but reduces the dependency on per-label subjectivity. Our proposed methods can
help identify arguments that individuals may interpret differently, fostering a
more nuanced annotation process.

*Yanrui Du,Fenglei Fan,Sendong Zhao,Jiawei Cao,Qika Lin,Kai He,Ting Liu,Bing Qin,Mengling Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IFT训练会削弱LLM的安全拒绝能力，研究发现这是由于拒绝方向(r-direction)在训练中漂移导致的。提出ProCon方法通过投影约束损失来正则化r方向的投影幅度，结合预热策略和数据增强，有效缓解安全风险同时保持任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 指令微调(IFT)虽然能提升大语言模型的各种能力，但会显著损害模型的安全性，特别是拒绝恶意指令的能力。研究发现隐藏状态中的拒绝方向(r-direction)在训练过程中容易发生漂移，这是导致安全风险的原因之一。

Method: 提出ProCon方法：1) 使用投影约束损失项来正则化每个训练样本隐藏状态在r方向上的投影幅度；2) 引入预热策略，在训练早期施加强约束；3) 通过拓宽数据分布来增强约束信号。

Result: 在各种数据集、场景和LLM上的实验表明，该方法能显著减轻IFT带来的安全风险，同时保持任务性能增益。与强基线相比，始终提供更优的整体性能。分析显示ProCon有助于稳定训练过程中的r方向。

Conclusion: ProCon方法有效解决了IFT训练中的安全风险问题，基于可解释性驱动的LLM内部机制探索为未来的安全研究奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) has been widely adopted as an effective
post-training strategy to enhance various abilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, prior studies have shown that IFT can significantly compromise
LLMs' safety, particularly their ability to refuse malicious instructions,
raising significant concerns. Recent research into the internal mechanisms of
LLMs has identified the refusal direction (r-direction) in the hidden states,
which plays a pivotal role in governing refusal behavior. Building on this
insight, our study reveals that the r-direction tends to drift during training,
which we identify as one of the causes of the associated safety risks. To
mitigate such drift, our proposed ProCon method introduces a
projection-constrained loss term that regularizes the projection magnitude of
each training sample's hidden state onto the r-direction. Our initial analysis
shows that applying an appropriate constraint can effectively mitigate the
refusal direction drift and associated safety risks, but remains limited by
overall performance barriers. To overcome this barrier, informed by our
observation of early-stage sharp drift and a data-driven perspective, we
introduce a warm-up strategy that emphasizes early-stage strong constraints and
broaden the data distribution to strengthen constraint signals, leading to an
enhanced ProCon method. Experimental results under various datasets, scenarios,
and LLMs demonstrate that our method can significantly mitigate safety risks
posed by IFT while preserving task performance gains. Even compared with strong
baselines, our method consistently delivers superior overall performance.
Crucially, our analysis indicates that ProCon can contribute to stabilizing the
r-direction during training, while such an interpretability-driven exploration
of LLMs' internal mechanisms lays a solid foundation for future safety
research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MachineLearningLM是一个持续预训练框架，通过合成大量结构因果模型任务来增强LLM的上下文机器学习能力，在少样本到1024样本范围内都表现出色，同时保持通用聊天能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然具有广泛的世界知识和推理能力，但在标准机器学习任务中难以通过纯上下文学习从大量样本中有效学习，需要提升其上下文机器学习能力。

Method: 使用随机森林教师模型，从数百万个结构因果模型中合成ML任务进行持续预训练，采用token高效的提示序列化方法，支持最多1024个样本的上下文学习。

Result: 在Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct模型上，平均比GPT-5-mini等强基线模型在跨领域表格分类任务上提升约15%，准确率随样本数量从8到1024单调增长，达到随机森林级别的准确率，同时保持75.4%的MMLU得分。

Conclusion: MachineLearningLM框架成功增强了LLM的上下文机器学习能力，实现了从少样本到多样本的稳定性能提升，同时保持了模型的通用知识和推理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess broad world knowledge and strong
general-purpose reasoning ability, yet they struggle to learn from many
in-context examples on standard machine learning (ML) tasks, that is, to
leverage many-shot demonstrations purely via in-context learning (ICL) without
gradient descent. We introduce MachineLearningLM, a portable
continued-pretraining framework that equips a general-purpose LLM with robust
in-context ML capability while preserving its general knowledge and reasoning
for broader chat workflows.
  Our pretraining procedure synthesizes ML tasks from millions of structural
causal models (SCMs), spanning shot counts up to 1,024. We begin with a
random-forest teacher, distilling tree-based decision strategies into the LLM
to strengthen robustness in numerical modeling. All tasks are serialized with a
token-efficient prompt, enabling 3x to 6x more examples per context window and
delivering up to 50x amortized throughput via batch inference.
  Despite a modest setup (Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct with LoRA rank 8),
MachineLearningLM outperforms strong LLM baselines (e.g., GPT-5-mini) by an
average of about 15% on out-of-distribution tabular classification across
finance, physics, biology, and healthcare domains. It exhibits a striking
many-shot scaling law: accuracy increases monotonically as in-context
demonstrations grow from 8 to 1,024. Without any task-specific training, it
attains random-forest-level accuracy across hundreds of shots. General chat
capabilities, including knowledge and reasoning, are preserved: it achieves
75.4% on MMLU.

TL;DR: MoGU_v2框架通过动态路由机制平衡LLM的安全性和可用性，在多个LLM系列中实现稳定改进，无需在安全性和实用性之间做出权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM安全方法往往导致保守的拒绝式响应，损害了实际可用性，需要在安全性和可用性之间找到更好的平衡点。

Method: MoGU_v2框架在编码高可分类安全特征的层中嵌入路由器，通过双向适配机制实现路由器与隐藏状态的紧密耦合，并使用数据混合策略恢复安全性。

Result: MoGU_v2在各种LLM系列中表现出强大的适应性和稳定改进，包括主流LLM、设备端LLM和推理LLM，能轻松恢复安全性而不影响任务性能。

Conclusion: MoGU_v2是一个强大且多功能的解决方案，能够有效缓解实际应用中的安全风险，在安全性和可用性之间实现了帕累托前沿的推进。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly permeate human life, their
security has emerged as a critical concern, particularly their ability to
maintain harmless responses to malicious instructions. Although extensive
methods have improved LLMs' security, they often lead to conservative,
rejection-oriented responses that compromise practical usability. This presents
a key challenge: how to advance the Pareto frontier between LLMs' usability and
security, rather than necessitate a trade-off between them. To address this, we
propose the MoGU framework, in which the intra-layer router dynamically
allocates weights by sensing hidden states, thereby balancing the contributions
of security-optimized and usability-optimized variants. Despite its initial
potential, the MoGU framework faces limitations such as parameter redundancy
and performance bottlenecks. To overcome these, we further propose an improved
MoGU_v2 framework that establishes a tighter coupling between the routers and
hidden states. In MoGU_v2, routers are embedded only in layers encoding highly
classifiable security features, and backbone modules are activated during
router optimization to enable bidirectional adaptation. MoGU_V2 exhibits strong
adaptability and stable improvements across various series of LLMs, including
mainstream LLMs serving as brains in various applications, on-device LLMs
optimized for resource-constrained scenarios, and reasoning LLMs tailored for
user interpretability. Meanwhile, even facing risks introduced by Instruction
Fine-tuning, MoGU_v2 can easily restore security without compromising the task
performance gains via a simple data-mix strategy. These comprehensive
improvements highlight MoGU_V2 as a robust and versatile solution for
mitigating security risks in real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量、逻辑正确的数学推理数据稀缺是提升大语言模型数学推理能力的关键瓶颈，需要构建可扩展的数据生成框架。

Method: 基于E-prover的饱和能力，在TPTP公理库上进行公理饱和，筛选'有趣'定理，生成不含LLM的纯符号数据，构建三个难度任务：蕴含验证、前提选择和证明重构。

Result: 零样本实验显示前沿模型在需要深度结构化推理的任务上表现崩溃，该框架既能诊断这种差距，又能提供可扩展的符号训练数据。

Conclusion: 提出了一个原则性、简单的数据生成框架，能够产生大规模保证有效的数学推理数据，为提升LLMs的数学推理能力提供了诊断工具和训练数据源。

Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality, logically sound data is a critical bottleneck
for advancing the mathematical reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs). Our
work confronts this challenge by turning decades of automated theorem proving
research into a scalable data engine. Rather than relying on error-prone LLMs
or complex proof-assistant syntax like Lean and Isabelle, our framework
leverages E-prover's saturation capabilities on the vast TPTP axiom library to
derive a massive, guaranteed-valid corpus of theorems. Our pipeline is
principled and simple: saturate axioms, filter for "interesting" theorems, and
generate tasks. With no LLMs in the loop, we eliminate factual errors by
construction. This purely symbolic data is then transformed into three
difficulty-controlled challenges: entailment verification, premise selection,
and proof reconstruction. Our zero-shot experiments on frontier models reveal a
clear weakness: performance collapses on tasks requiring deep, structural
reasoning. Our framework provides both the diagnostic tool to measure this gap
and a scalable source of symbolic training data to address it. We make the code
and data publicly available.

TL;DR: 新颖框架用于测试LLM在风电气维护日志分类任务中的表现，发现性能存在明显层次差异，建议采用人在循环系统实现最佳应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 风电气维护日志的非结构化特性继续阻碍自动化分析，必须开发可重现的测试框架来评估LLM在这些复杂工业记录中的表现。

Method: 开发了一个公开源的可重现框架，系统性评估多种商业和开源LLM，分析它们在可靠性、运营效率和模型检验方面的交易。

Result: 结果量化了明显的性能层次结构，识别出了与标准很高对齐且可信的模型。分类性能高度依赖于语义模糊性，所有模型在对象性组件识别上比解释性维护动作更容易达成共识。

Conclusion: 由于没有模型能达到完美准确性且检验结果差异很大，最有效和负责任的近期应用是人在循环系统，让LLM作为强大助手加速数据标注过程，从而提升O&M数据质量和下游可靠性分析。

Abstract: Effective Operation and Maintenance (O&M) is critical to reducing the
Levelised Cost of Energy (LCOE) from wind power, yet the unstructured,
free-text nature of turbine maintenance logs presents a significant barrier to
automated analysis. Our paper addresses this by presenting a novel and
reproducible framework for benchmarking Large Language Models (LLMs) on the
task of classifying these complex industrial records. To promote transparency
and encourage further research, this framework has been made publicly available
as an open-source tool. We systematically evaluate a diverse suite of
state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source LLMs, providing a foundational
assessment of their trade-offs in reliability, operational efficiency, and
model calibration. Our results quantify a clear performance hierarchy,
identifying top models that exhibit high alignment with a benchmark standard
and trustworthy, well-calibrated confidence scores. We also demonstrate that
classification performance is highly dependent on the task's semantic
ambiguity, with all models showing higher consensus on objective component
identification than on interpretive maintenance actions. Given that no model
achieves perfect accuracy and that calibration varies dramatically, we conclude
that the most effective and responsible near-term application is a
Human-in-the-Loop system, where LLMs act as a powerful assistant to accelerate
and standardise data labelling for human experts, thereby enhancing O&M data
quality and downstream reliability analysis.

TL;DR: COMPACT是一种联合剪枝方法，通过剪枝稀有词汇表来缩小嵌入/解嵌入层，并使用常见词加权的激活值来剪枝FFN中间通道，在保持标准Transformer架构的同时实现高效压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 使LLM在内存、延迟和服务成本方面更高效，以支持边缘部署、交互式应用和大规模可持续推理。现有剪枝方法存在局限性：宽度剪枝破坏标准架构或需要定制推理代码，深度剪枝移除整个层导致精度骤降。

Method: 联合剪枝：(1)剪枝稀有词汇表缩小嵌入/解嵌入层；(2)基于常见词加权的激活值剪枝FFN中间通道，使重要性评估与剪枝后的词分布对齐。

Result: 在Qwen、LLaMA和Gemma系列模型(0.5B-70B)上实验显示，在相似或更高剪枝比例下达到最先进的下游任务性能，显著减少参数量、GPU内存和端到端延迟。

Conclusion: COMPACT结合了深度和宽度剪枝的优点：部署友好(保持标准架构)、规模适应性(词汇表与FFN剪枝权衡)、无需训练的竞争性剪枝时间，以及强大的内存节省和吞吐量提升。

Abstract: Making LLMs more efficient in memory, latency, and serving cost is crucial
for edge deployment, interactive applications, and sustainable inference at
scale. Pruning is a key technique toward this goal. However, prior pruning
methods are limited: width pruning often breaks the standard transformer layout
or requires custom inference code, while depth pruning removes entire layers
and can cause abrupt accuracy drops. In this work, we propose COMPACT, which
jointly (i) prunes rare vocabulary to shrink embedding/unembedding and (ii)
prunes FFN intermediate channels using common-token-weighted activations,
aligning importance with the post-pruning token distribution. COMPACT enjoys
merits of both depth and width pruning, such as: deployment-friendliness (keeps
a standard transformer architecture), scale-adaptivity (trade off vocab vs. FFN
pruning), training-free operation with competitive pruning time, and strong
memory savings alongside throughput gains. Experiments across Qwen, LLaMA, and
Gemma families (0.5B-70B) show state-of-the-art downstream task performance at
similar or higher pruning ratios, with substantial reductions in parameters,
GPU memory, and end-to-end latency.

Conclusion: 研究强调了基于文化的评估标准对发展可信质和文化负责任AI的重要性。EPT评量标准为评估LLM在特定文化背景下的可信质性提供了价值工具，数据集已公开可用

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), trained on extensive datasets using advanced
deep learning architectures, have demonstrated remarkable performance across a
wide range of language tasks, becoming a cornerstone of modern AI technologies.
However, ensuring their trustworthiness remains a critical challenge, as
reliability is essential not only for accurate performance but also for
upholding ethical, cultural, and social values. Careful alignment of training
data and culturally grounded evaluation criteria are vital for developing
responsible AI systems. In this study, we introduce the EPT (Evaluation of
Persian Trustworthiness) metric, a culturally informed benchmark specifically
designed to assess the trustworthiness of LLMs across six key aspects:
truthfulness, safety, fairness, robustness, privacy, and ethical alignment. We
curated a labeled dataset and evaluated the performance of several leading
models - including ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini, Grok, LLaMA, Mistral, and
Qwen - using both automated LLM-based and human assessments. Our results reveal
significant deficiencies in the safety dimension, underscoring the urgent need
for focused attention on this critical aspect of model behavior. Furthermore,
our findings offer valuable insights into the alignment of these models with
Persian ethical-cultural values and highlight critical gaps and opportunities
for advancing trustworthy and culturally responsible AI. The dataset is

Method: 使用强化学习训练聚合器模型，让模型学会审查、协调和综合多个候选解决方案得出最终正确答案，关键是通过平衡难易训练样本来学习恢复少数但正确的答案

Result: AggLM方法在多个基准测试中优于基于规则和奖励模型的基线方法，能够有效泛化到不同模型的解决方案，包括比训练数据中更强的模型，同时比多数投票方法需要更少的token

Conclusion: 将聚合作为显式推理技能进行学习是有效的，通过精心设计的强化学习训练可以实现更好的解决方案整合，提高大语言模型的推理性能

Abstract: Scaling up test-time compute, by generating multiple independent solutions
and selecting or aggregating among them, has become a central paradigm for
improving large language models (LLMs) on challenging reasoning tasks. While
most prior work relies on simple majority voting or reward model ranking to
aggregate solutions, these approaches may only yield limited benefits. In this
work, we propose to learn aggregation as an explicit reasoning skill: given a
set of candidate solutions, we train an aggregator model to review, reconcile,
and synthesize a final, correct answer using reinforcement learning from
verifiable rewards. A key ingredient is careful balancing of easy and hard
training examples, allowing the model to learn both to recover
minority-but-correct answers as well as easy majority-correct answers.
Empirically, we find our method, AggLM, outperforms both strong rule-based and
reward-model baselines, across multiple benchmarks. Furthermore, it generalizes
effectively to solutions from differing models, including stronger ones than
contained in the training data, all while requiring substantially fewer tokens
than majority voting with larger numbers of solutions.

Motivation: 参与CheckThat! Task 2英文任务，旨在开发有效方法从社交媒体内容中识别和提取值得进行事实核查的主张。

Method: 采用多种提示和上下文学习方法，包括少样本提示（few-shot prompting）和对不同大型语言模型（LLM）家族进行微调，特别使用了FLAN-T5模型。

Result: 微调FLAN-T5模型获得了最佳的METEOR分数，但观察到其他方法尽管METEOR分数较低，有时却能提取出更高质量的主张。

Conclusion: 虽然自动评估指标（如METEOR）是重要的基准，但高质量的主张提取可能不完全依赖于这些指标，需要综合考虑其他质量因素。

Abstract: We participate in CheckThat! Task 2 English and explore various methods of
prompting and in-context learning, including few-shot prompting and fine-tuning

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 编码器模型在多语言领域的研究缺乏，需要提升对高资源和低资源语言的处理能力。

Method: 使用逆掩码比率调度和逆温度采样策略，在衰减阶段添加1700多个低资源语言进行训练。

Result: 在分类任务上达到了与OpenAI o3和Google Gemini 2.5 Pro相似的性能，在高资源和低资源语言上都显著超过前一代模型。

Conclusion: mmBERT证明了通过优化训练策略，编码器模型仍然可以在多语言任务上取得竞争力的结果。

Abstract: Encoder-only languages models are frequently used for a variety of standard
machine learning tasks, including classification and retrieval. However, there
has been a lack of recent research for encoder models, especially with respect
to multilingual models. We introduce mmBERT, an encoder-only language model
pretrained on 3T tokens of multilingual text in over 1800 languages. To build
mmBERT we introduce several novel elements, including an inverse mask ratio
schedule and an inverse temperature sampling ratio. We add over 1700
low-resource languages to the data mix only during the decay phase, showing
that it boosts performance dramatically and maximizes the gains from the
relatively small amount of training data. Despite only including these
low-resource languages in the short decay phase we achieve similar
classification performance to models like OpenAI's o3 and Google's Gemini 2.5
Pro. Overall, we show that mmBERT significantly outperforms the previous
generation of models on classification and retrieval tasks -- on both high and
low-resource languages.

Conclusion: PCN轻量级且模型无关，可无缝集成到现有应用中，并通过加密承诺进行扩展，为数值敏感场景建立了信任必须通过证明获得的简单契约。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as stochastic systems may generate numbers that
deviate from available data, a failure known as \emph{numeric hallucination}.
Existing safeguards -- retrieval-augmented generation, citations, and
uncertainty estimation -- improve transparency but cannot guarantee fidelity:
fabricated or misquoted values may still be displayed as if correct. We propose
\textbf{Proof-Carrying Numbers (PCN)}, a presentation-layer protocol that
enforces numeric fidelity through mechanical verification. Under PCN, numeric
spans are emitted as \emph{claim-bound tokens} tied to structured claims, and a
verifier checks each token under a declared policy (e.g., exact equality,
rounding, aliases, or tolerance with qualifiers). Crucially, PCN places
verification in the \emph{renderer}, not the model: only claim-checked numbers
are marked as verified, and all others default to unverified. This separation
prevents spoofing and guarantees fail-closed behavior. We formalize PCN and
prove soundness, completeness under honest tokens, fail-closed behavior, and
monotonicity under policy refinement. PCN is lightweight and model-agnostic,
integrates seamlessly into existing applications, and can be extended with
cryptographic commitments. By enforcing verification as a mandatory step before
display, PCN establishes a simple contract for numerically sensitive settings:
\emph{trust is earned only by proof}, while the absence of a mark communicates
uncertainty.

### [229] [Beyond Two-Stage Training: Cooperative SFT and RL for LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06948)
*Liang Chen,Xueting Han,Li Shen,Jing Bai,Kam-Fai Wong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于双层优化的新方法，通过让监督微调(SFT)元学习如何指导强化学习(RL)的优化过程，实现SFT和RL的更好协作，在五个推理基准测试中取得了更好的效果和效率平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的两阶段方法（先SFT后RL）限制了SFT和RL之间的交互，从而限制了整体效果。RL虽然能有效激励大语言模型的推理能力，但由于试错性质导致效率低下。

Method: 采用双层优化方法，将SFT目标条件化于最优RL策略，使SFT能够元学习如何指导RL的优化过程。下层执行RL更新同时接收SFT监督，上层显式最大化协作增益（联合训练相比单独RL的性能优势）。

Result: 在五个推理基准测试上的实证评估表明，该方法始终优于基线方法，并在效果和效率之间实现了更好的平衡。

Conclusion: 通过双层优化促进SFT和RL的协作训练，能够显著提升大语言模型推理能力的训练效果和效率，为联合训练范式提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective in incentivizing the
reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), but suffers from severe
efficiency challenges due to its trial-and-error nature. While the common
practice employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a warm-up stage for RL, this
decoupled two-stage approach limits interaction between SFT and RL, thereby
constraining overall effectiveness. This study introduces a novel method for
learning reasoning models that employs bilevel optimization to facilitate
better cooperation between these training paradigms. By conditioning the SFT
objective on the optimal RL policy, our approach enables SFT to meta-learn how
to guide RL's optimization process. During training, the lower level performs
RL updates while simultaneously receiving SFT supervision, and the upper level
explicitly maximizes the cooperative gain-the performance advantage of joint
SFT-RL training over RL alone. Empirical evaluations on five reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines and
achieves a better balance between effectiveness and efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决扩散语言模型在复杂推理任务中的性能问题，并提高采样灵活性，作者提出了一个能够整合偏好推理轨迹的强化学习框架。

Result: TraDo-4B-Instruct在数学推理任务上 consistently 超越7B规模的AR模型；TraDo-8B-Instruct在数学推理基准上相对Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct提升6.1%，相对Llama3.1-8B-Instruct提升51.3%；首个long-CoT DLM在MATH500上相对Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct提升18.1%。

Conclusion: TraceRL框架有效提升了扩散语言模型的推理性能，发布了开源工具包促进可复现研究和实际应用，在数学和编程任务上取得了state-of-the-art的结果。

Abstract: We propose TraceRL, a trajectory-aware reinforcement learning framework for
diffusion language models (DLMs) that incorporates preferred inference
trajectory into post-training, and is applicable across different
architectures. Equipped with a diffusion-based value model that enhances
training stability, we demonstrate improved reasoning performance on complex
math and coding tasks. Besides, it can also be applied to adapt block-specific
models to larger blocks, which improves sampling flexibility. Employing
TraceRL, we derive a series of state-of-the-art diffusion language models,
namely TraDo. Although smaller than 7B-scale AR models, TraDo-4B-Instruct still
consistently outperforms them across complex math reasoning tasks.
TraDo-8B-Instruct achieves relative accuracy improvements of 6.1% over
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and 51.3% over Llama3.1-8B-Instruct on mathematical
reasoning benchmarks. Through curriculum learning, we also derive the first
long-CoT DLM, outperforming Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on MATH500 with an 18.1%
relative accuracy gain. To facilitate reproducible research and practical
applications, we release a comprehensive open-source framework for building,
training, and deploying diffusion LLMs across diverse architectures. The
framework integrates accelerated KV-cache techniques and inference engines for
both inference and reinforcement learning, and includes implementations of
various supervised fine-tuning and RL methods for mathematics, coding, and
general tasks. Code and Models: https://github.com/Gen-Verse/dLLM-RL

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了语言模型的语用理解能力，通过Wavelength游戏框架评估了各种模型在语言理解和生成任务上的表现，并探索了理性语言行为(RSA)提升模型表现的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型作为会话助所的应用越来越广泛，需要理解它们的语用理解能力，即如何在上下文中进行通信目标和规范的推理。

Method: 使用Wavelength通信游戏框架，研究了多种语言模型在直接提示、思维链(CoT)提示以及理性语言行为(RSA)接口下的表现。

Result: 发现最先进的大型语言模型在语言理解任务上达到了类似人类的准确率，而在语言生成任务上，CoT提示比直接提示效果更好，RSA方法则能够显著提升两种方法的表现。

Conclusion: 该研究帮助识别了语言模型在语用理解方面的优势与局限性，并展示了RSA在提升模型表现方面的潜力，为进一步理解概念表征、语言理解和社会推理打开了新方向。

Abstract: Language use is shaped by pragmatics -- i.e., reasoning about communicative
goals and norms in context. As language models (LMs) are increasingly used as
conversational agents, it becomes ever more important to understand their
pragmatic reasoning abilities. We propose an evaluation framework derived from
Wavelength, a popular communication game where a speaker and a listener
communicate about a broad range of concepts in a granular manner. We study a
range of LMs on both language comprehension and language production using
direct and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, and further explore a Rational
Speech Act (RSA) approach to incorporating Bayesian pragmatic reasoning into LM
inference. We find that state-of-the-art LMs, but not smaller ones, achieve
strong performance on language comprehension, obtaining similar-to-human
accuracy and exhibiting high correlations with human judgments even without CoT
prompting or RSA. On language production, CoT can outperform direct prompting,
and using RSA provides significant improvements over both approaches. Our study
helps identify the strengths and limitations in LMs' pragmatic reasoning
abilities and demonstrates the potential for improving them with RSA, opening
up future avenues for understanding conceptual representation, language
understanding, and social reasoning in LMs and humans.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 一种基于GPU的并行网格优化方法，解决了传统网格简化中的自相交、表面偏移和效率低下等问题，能在3秒内将百万级面片网格简化到十万级。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统网格简化方法存在的三个主要问题：简化过程中容易产生自相交（影响3D扑印和模拟应用）；需要先进行重新网格化带来表面偏移和锐利特征丢失；大规模网格处理效率低下。

Method: 方法包含三个核心组件：(1)并行重新网格化算法，将随机网格转换为水密、流形且无相交的网格，减少形状不良的三角形；(2)稳健的并行简化算法，保证不产生相交；(3)基于优化的安全投影算法，将简化后网格与输入网格对齐，消除重新网格化带来的表面偏移并恢复原始锐利特征。

Result: 算法显示出显著的效率，在RTX4090上仅用3秒就可将一个含有200万个面片的网格简化到仅剩20,000个三角形。在Thingi10K数据集上的评估显示了该方法在几何保持和速度方面的杰出性能。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种高效的GPU并行网格优化方案，成功解决了传统网格简化中的自相交、表面偏移和效率低下等关键问题，为大规模网格处理提供了快速而可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Reducing the triangle count in complex 3D models is a basic geometry
preprocessing step in graphics pipelines such as efficient rendering and
interactive editing. However, most existing mesh simplification methods exhibit
a few issues. Firstly, they often lead to self-intersections during decimation,
a major issue for applications such as 3D printing and soft-body simulation.
Second, to perform simplification on a mesh in the wild, one would first need
to perform re-meshing, which often suffers from surface shifts and losses of
sharp features. Finally, existing re-meshing and simplification methods can
take minutes when processing large-scale meshes, limiting their applications in
practice. To address the challenges, we introduce a novel GPU-based mesh
optimization approach containing three key components: (1) a parallel
re-meshing algorithm to turn meshes in the wild into watertight, manifold, and
intersection-free ones, and reduce the prevalence of poorly shaped triangles;
(2) a robust parallel simplification algorithm with intersection-free
guarantees; (3) an optimization-based safe projection algorithm to realign the
simplified mesh with the input, eliminating the surface shift introduced by
re-meshing and recovering the original sharp features. The algorithm
demonstrates remarkable efficiency, simplifying a 2-million-face mesh to 20k
triangles in 3 seconds on RTX4090. We evaluated the approach on the Thingi10K
dataset and showcased its exceptional performance in geometry preservation and
speed.

Motivation: 解决张力结构网络在制造过程中因展平导致的张力梯度精度损失问题，实现精确的张力编程制造

Method: 使用力密度法定义张力梯度，通过数值优化顶点位置和将直线元素转换为弧线来创建未拉伸对应网络，再分解为可打印路径

Result: 实验验证显示平均元素应变误差小于1.0%，成功制造了蜘蛛网、曲面网格和张力结构系统等复杂案例

Conclusion: 该方法能够制造紧凑的集成电缆网络，为医疗支具等应用提供了新的制造可能性

Abstract: Each element in tensioned structural networks -- such as tensegrity,
architectural fabrics, or medical braces/meshes -- requires a specific tension
level to achieve and maintain the desired shape, stability, and compliance.
These structures are challenging to manufacture, 3D print, or assemble because
flattening the network during fabrication introduces multiplicative
inaccuracies in the network's final tension gradients. This study overcomes
this challenge by offering a fabrication algorithm for direct 3D printing of
such networks with programmed tension gradients, an approach analogous to the
spinning of spiderwebs. The algorithm: (i) defines the desired network and
prescribes its tension gradients using the force density method; (ii) converts
the network into an unstretched counterpart by numerically optimizing vertex
locations toward target element lengths and converting straight elements into
arcs to resolve any remaining error; and (iii) decomposes the network into
printable toolpaths; Optional additional steps are: (iv) flattening curved 2D
networks or 3D networks to ensure 3D printing compatibility; and (v)
automatically resolving any unwanted crossings introduced by the flattening
process. The proposed method is experimentally validated using 2D unit cells of
viscoelastic filaments, where accurate tension gradients are achieved with an
average element strain error of less than 1.0\%. The method remains effective
for networks with element minimum length and maximum stress of 5.8 mm and 7.3
MPa, respectively. The method is used to demonstrate the fabrication of three
complex cases: a flat spiderweb, a curved mesh, and a tensegrity system. The
programmable tension gradient algorithm can be utilized to produce compact,
integrated cable networks, enabling novel applications such as moment-exerting
structures in medical braces and splints.

Method: 首先使用骨骼动画生成粗糕图像作为几何指导，然后通过基于inpainting的视频滴渡模型增强纹理和二级动力。采用领域适配滴渡模型精炼用户手动掩码的区域，并通过二级动力注入(SDI)策略在去噪过程中提升动作真实性。还提出头发分层建模(HLM)技术分离头发和身体，以便更自然地动画长发角色

Result: 实验结果显示，该系统在定量和定性评估中都超过了现有的最先进方法

Conclusion: 该混合动画系统有效地结合了骨骼动画的几何一致性优势和视频滴渡模型的动态表现能力，为手绘形象动画提供了一种新的解决方案

Abstract: Hand-drawn character animation is a vibrant field in computer graphics,
presenting challenges in achieving geometric consistency while conveying
expressive motion. Traditional skeletal animation methods maintain geometric
consistency but struggle with complex non-rigid elements like flowing hair and
skirts, leading to unnatural deformation. Conversely, video diffusion models
synthesize realistic dynamics but often create geometric distortions in
stylized drawings due to domain gaps. This work proposes a hybrid animation
system that combines skeletal animation and video diffusion. Initially, coarse
images are generated from characters retargeted with skeletal animations for
geometric guidance. These images are then enhanced in texture and secondary
dynamics using video diffusion priors, framing this enhancement as an
inpainting task. A domain-adapted diffusion model refines user-masked regions
needing improvement, especially for secondary dynamics. To enhance motion
realism further, we introduce a Secondary Dynamics Injection (SDI) strategy in
the denoising process, incorporating features from a pre-trained diffusion
model enriched with human motion priors. Additionally, to tackle unnatural
deformations from low-poly single-mesh character modeling, we present a Hair
Layering Modeling (HLM) technique that uses segmentation maps to separate hair
from the body, allowing for more natural animation of long-haired characters.
Extensive experiments show that our system outperforms state-of-the-art methods
in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

TL;DR: SKEL是一个新的参数化3D人体模型，通过将SMPL模型重新绑定到生物力学准确的骨骼结构上，解决了现有模型在生物力学准确性方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人体模型（如SMPL）具有简化的运动学结构，与真实人体骨骼系统的关节位置和关节结构不符，限制了其在生物力学中的应用。而传统的生物力学准确骨骼运动估计方法通常依赖复杂的运动捕捉系统和昂贵的优化方法。

Method: 1）通过优化AMASS序列中SMPL网格内的生物力学准确骨骼来构建数据集；2）学习从SMPL网格顶点到优化关节位置和骨骼旋转的回归器；3）用新的运动学参数重新参数化SMPL网格。

Result: SKEL模型比SMPL具有更生物力学准确的关节位置，骨骼更好地拟合在体表内部。能够将现有的人体姿态和形状数据集"升级"为包含生物力学参数。

Conclusion: SKEL提供了一个新工具，实现了"野外生物力学"，同时为视觉和图形研究人员提供了更好约束和更真实的人体关节模型。

Abstract: Great progress has been made in estimating 3D human pose and shape from
images and video by training neural networks to directly regress the parameters
of parametric human models like SMPL. However, existing body models have
simplified kinematic structures that do not correspond to the true joint
locations and articulations in the human skeletal system, limiting their
potential use in biomechanics. On the other hand, methods for estimating
biomechanically accurate skeletal motion typically rely on complex motion
capture systems and expensive optimization methods. What is needed is a
parametric 3D human model with a biomechanically accurate skeletal structure
that can be easily posed. To that end, we develop SKEL, which re-rigs the SMPL
body model with a biomechanics skeleton. To enable this, we need training data
of skeletons inside SMPL meshes in diverse poses.
  We build such a dataset by optimizing biomechanically accurate skeletons
inside SMPL meshes from AMASS sequences. We then learn a regressor from SMPL
mesh vertices to the optimized joint locations and bone rotations. Finally, we
re-parametrize the SMPL mesh with the new kinematic parameters. The resulting
SKEL model is animatable like SMPL but with fewer, and
biomechanically-realistic, degrees of freedom. We show that SKEL has more
biomechanically accurate joint locations than SMPL, and the bones fit inside
the body surface better than previous methods. By fitting SKEL to SMPL meshes
we are able to "upgrade" existing human pose and shape datasets to include
biomechanical parameters. SKEL provides a new tool to enable biomechanics in
the wild, while also providing vision and graphics researchers with a better
constrained and more realistic model of human articulation. The model, code,
and data are available for research at https://skel.is.tue.mpg.de..

Conclusion: 通过合成数据和token解缠的联合优化，实现了更好的泛化能力和重建质量，为可扩展的新视角合成提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Large transformer-based models have made significant progress in
generalizable novel view synthesis (NVS) from sparse input views, generating
novel viewpoints without the need for test-time optimization. However, these
models are constrained by the limited diversity of publicly available scene
datasets, making most real-world (in-the-wild) scenes out-of-distribution. To
overcome this, we incorporate synthetic training data generated from diffusion
models, which improves generalization across unseen domains. While synthetic
data offers scalability, we identify artifacts introduced during data
generation as a key bottleneck affecting reconstruction quality. To address
this, we propose a token disentanglement process within the transformer
architecture, enhancing feature separation and ensuring more effective
learning. This refinement not only improves reconstruction quality over
standard transformers but also enables scalable training with synthetic data.
As a result, our method outperforms existing models on both in-dataset and
cross-dataset evaluations, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple
benchmarks while significantly reducing computational costs. Project page:

address this, the MVRS dataset is introduced, featuring synchronized recordings

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly envisioned as intelligent
assistants for personalized learning, systematic head-to-head evaluations
within authentic learning scenarios remain limited. This study conducts an
empirical comparison of three state-of-the-art LLMs on a tutoring task that
simulates a realistic learning setting. Using a dataset comprising a student's
answers to ten questions of mixed formats with correctness labels, each LLM is
required to (i) analyze the quiz to identify underlying knowledge components,
(ii) infer the student's mastery profile, and (iii) generate targeted guidance
for improvement. To mitigate subjectivity and evaluator bias, we employ Gemini
as a virtual judge to perform pairwise comparisons along various dimensions:
accuracy, clarity, actionability, and appropriateness. Results analyzed via the

Abstract: We introduce SasAgent, a multi-agent AI system powered by large language
models (LLMs) that automates small-angle scattering (SAS) data analysis by
leveraging tools from the SasView software and enables user interaction via
text input. SasAgent features a coordinator agent that interprets user prompts
and delegates tasks to three specialized agents for scattering length density
(SLD) calculation, synthetic data generation, and experimental data fitting.
These agents utilize LLM-friendly tools to execute tasks efficiently. These
tools, including the model data tool, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
documentation tool, bump fitting tool, and SLD calculator tool, are derived
from the SasView Python library. A user-friendly Gradio-based interface
enhances user accessibility. Through diverse examples, we demonstrate
SasAgent's ability to interpret complex prompts, calculate SLDs, generate
accurate scattering data, and fit experimental datasets with high precision.
This work showcases the potential of LLM-driven AI systems to streamline
scientific workflows and enhance automation in SAS research.

*Arend Hintze*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文通过自相关分析揭示了提示工程优化景观的结构特征，发现系统化提示生成产生平滑衰减的自相关，而多样化生成则呈现非单调模式，表明存在崎岖、分层结构的景观。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法将提示优化视为黑盒问题，应用复杂搜索算法但未描述其导航的景观拓扑结构，需要系统分析提示工程中的适应度景观结构。

Method: 使用语义嵌入空间的自相关分析，在错误检测任务上进行实验，采用两种提示生成策略：系统枚举（1,024个提示）和新颖性驱动的多样化（1,000个提示）。

Result: 系统提示生成产生平滑衰减的自相关，多样化生成呈现非单调模式，在中间语义距离处达到峰值相关性。不同错误类型的崎岖程度各不相同。

Conclusion: 研究结果为理解提示工程景观中优化的复杂性提供了实证基础，揭示了不同提示生成策略产生的根本不同的景观拓扑结构。

Abstract: While prompt engineering has emerged as a crucial technique for optimizing
large language model performance, the underlying optimization landscape remains
poorly understood. Current approaches treat prompt optimization as a black-box
problem, applying sophisticated search algorithms without characterizing the
landscape topology they navigate. We present a systematic analysis of fitness
landscape structures in prompt engineering using autocorrelation analysis
across semantic embedding spaces. Through experiments on error detection tasks
with two distinct prompt generation strategies -- systematic enumeration (1,024
prompts) and novelty-driven diversification (1,000 prompts) -- we reveal
fundamentally different landscape topologies. Systematic prompt generation
yields smoothly decaying autocorrelation, while diversified generation exhibits
non-monotonic patterns with peak correlation at intermediate semantic
distances, indicating rugged, hierarchically structured landscapes.
Task-specific analysis across 10 error detection categories reveals varying
degrees of ruggedness across different error types. Our findings provide an
empirical foundation for understanding the complexity of optimization in prompt
engineering landscapes.

Method: 实现官方编码指南的代理框架，基于大语言模型，支持完整的ICD-10编码系统

Result: 在罕见诊断代码上达到最佳性能（对于高频代码，微调判别分类器仍保持优势，但仅限于高频代码）

Conclusion: 贡献了系统性能分析并识别了系统的'盲点'（系统性编码不足的代码），为未来工作指明方向

Abstract: In medical coding, experts map unstructured clinical notes to alphanumeric
codes for diagnoses and procedures. We introduce Code Like Humans: a new
agentic framework for medical coding with large language models. It implements
official coding guidelines for human experts, and it is the first solution that
can support the full ICD-10 coding system (+70K labels). It achieves the best
performance to date on rare diagnosis codes (fine-tuned discriminative
classifiers retain an advantage for high-frequency codes, to which they are
limited). Towards future work, we also contribute an analysis of system
performance and identify its `blind spots' (codes that are systematically
undercoded).

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了Alignment Gap概念，统一解释RLHF等对齐方法的失败模式，通过KL倾斜形式化说明优化压力导致代理奖励与人类意图偏离，提出Alignment Trilemma框架和MAPS设计杠杆。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLHF、DPO等人类偏好对齐方法存在奖励黑客、奉承、标注者漂移和错误泛化等重复失败模式，需要统一的理论框架来理解这些结构性限制。

Method: 使用KL倾斜形式化分析优化压力导致的偏差，组织失败模式为Murphy法则目录，提出Alignment Trilemma理论框架，并通过小规模实证研究进行验证。

Result: 建立了Alignment Gap统一视角，系统分类了对齐失败模式，提出了优化强度、价值捕获和泛化之间的三难权衡框架。

Conclusion: 本文不是不可能定理，而是重构对齐辩论的结构性限制和权衡视角，为未来设计提供更清晰的指导，提出了MAPS实践框架。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly aligned to human preferences through
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and related methods such as
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Constitutional AI, and RLAIF. While
effective, these methods exhibit recurring failure patterns i.e., reward
hacking, sycophancy, annotator drift, and misgeneralization. We introduce the
concept of the Alignment Gap, a unifying lens for understanding recurring
failures in feedback-based alignment. Using a KL-tilting formalism, we
illustrate why optimization pressure tends to amplify divergence between proxy
rewards and true human intent. We organize these failures into a catalogue of
Murphys Laws of AI Alignment, and propose the Alignment Trilemma as a way to
frame trade-offs among optimization strength, value capture, and
generalization. Small-scale empirical studies serve as illustrative support.
Finally, we propose the MAPS framework (Misspecification, Annotation, Pressure,
Shift) as practical design levers. Our contribution is not a definitive
impossibility theorem but a perspective that reframes alignment debates around
structural limits and trade-offs, offering clearer guidance for future design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统街道设计渲染方法劳动密集，阻碍集体套论和协作决策。AI辅助生成设计虽有潜力，但现有方法需要大量领域特定数据且难以实现精确的空间变化。

Method: 开发了一种多段系统，集成了车道定位、提示优化、设计生成和自动评估等模块，直接在真实街道图像上编辑自行车设施。

Result: 在多种城市场景中进行实验，系统能够适应不同的路径几何形状和环境条件，一质地产生视觉一致且符合指令要求的结果。

Conclusion: 这项工作为应用多段流水线到交通基础设施规划和设施设计领域奠定了基础。

Abstract: Realistic visual renderings of street-design scenarios are essential for
public engagement in active transportation planning. Traditional approaches are
labor-intensive, hindering collective deliberation and collaborative
decision-making. While AI-assisted generative design shows transformative
potential by enabling rapid creation of design scenarios, existing generative
approaches typically require large amounts of domain-specific training data and
struggle to enable precise spatial variations of design/configuration in
complex street-view scenes. We introduce a multi-agent system that edits and
redesigns bicycle facilities directly on real-world street-view imagery. The
framework integrates lane localization, prompt optimization, design generation,
and automated evaluation to synthesize realistic, contextually appropriate
designs. Experiments across diverse urban scenarios demonstrate that the system
can adapt to varying road geometries and environmental conditions, consistently
yielding visually coherent and instruction-compliant results. This work
establishes a foundation for applying multi-agent pipelines to transportation
infrastructure planning and facility design.

### [247] [TreeGPT: A Novel Hybrid Architecture for Abstract Syntax Tree Processing with Global Parent-Child Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05550)
*Zixi Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TreeGPT是一种新颖的神经架构，结合了transformer注意力机制和全局父子聚合，用于处理抽象语法树，在程序合成任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法要么依赖序列处理，要么使用图神经网络，无法有效捕捉AST的层次结构信息。需要一种能够同时处理局部依赖和全局树结构的混合方法。

Method: 采用混合设计：使用self-attention捕获局部依赖，TreeFFN通过迭代消息传递建模层次树结构。核心创新是全局父子聚合机制，支持双向传播和门控聚合。

Result: 在ARC Prize 2025数据集上达到96%准确率，显著优于transformer基线(1.3%)、Grok-4(15.9%)和SOAR(52%)，仅使用150万参数。

Conclusion: TreeGPT成功结合了transformer和图神经网络的优点，边投影是最关键组件，门控机制进一步提升了性能，为程序合成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce TreeGPT, a novel neural architecture that combines
transformer-based attention mechanisms with global parent-child aggregation for
processing Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) in neural program synthesis tasks.
Unlike traditional approaches that rely solely on sequential processing or
graph neural networks, TreeGPT employs a hybrid design that leverages both
self-attention for capturing local dependencies and a specialized Tree
Feed-Forward Network (TreeFFN) for modeling hierarchical tree structures
through iterative message passing.
  The core innovation lies in our Global Parent-Child Aggregation mechanism,
formalized as: $$h_i^{(t+1)} = \sigma \Big( h_i^{(0)} + W_{pc} \sum_{(p,c) \in
E_i} f(h_p^{(t)}, h_c^{(t)}) + b \Big)$$ where $h_i^{(t)}$ represents the
hidden state of node $i$ at iteration $t$, $E_i$ denotes all parent-child edges
involving node $i$, and $f(h_p, h_c)$ is an edge aggregation function. This
formulation enables each node to progressively aggregate information from the
entire tree structure through $T$ iterations.
  Our architecture integrates optional enhancements including gated aggregation
with learnable edge weights, residual connections for gradient stability, and
bidirectional propagation for capturing both bottom-up and top-down
dependencies. We evaluate TreeGPT on the ARC Prize 2025 dataset, a challenging
visual reasoning benchmark requiring abstract pattern recognition and rule
inference. Experimental results demonstrate that TreeGPT achieves 96\%
accuracy, significantly outperforming transformer baselines (1.3\%),
large-scale models like Grok-4 (15.9\%), and specialized program synthesis
methods like SOAR (52\%) while using only 1.5M parameters. Our comprehensive
ablation study reveals that edge projection is the most critical component,
with the combination of edge projection and gating achieving optimal
performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OccVLA是一个将3D占用表示集成到多模态推理中的新框架，解决了MLLMs在3D空间理解方面的不足，无需显式3D输入即可实现自动驾驶的先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉语言推理方面表现出色，但在3D空间理解方面存在不足，这对自动驾驶至关重要。主要挑战包括缺乏有效的3D表示构建方法和细粒度空间细节的丢失。

Method: 提出OccVLA框架，将密集3D占用既作为预测输出又作为监督信号，直接从2D视觉输入学习细粒度空间结构。占用预测可作为隐式推理过程，在推理时可跳过而不影响性能。

Result: 在nuScenes基准测试中实现了轨迹规划的最先进结果，在3D视觉问答任务上表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: OccVLA提供了一个可扩展、可解释且完全基于视觉的自动驾驶解决方案，无需额外计算开销即可实现强大的3D空间理解能力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong vision-language
reasoning abilities but still lack robust 3D spatial understanding, which is
critical for autonomous driving. This limitation stems from two key challenges:
(1) the difficulty of constructing accessible yet effective 3D representations
without expensive manual annotations, and (2) the loss of fine-grained spatial
details in VLMs due to the absence of large-scale 3D vision-language
pretraining. To address these challenges, we propose OccVLA, a novel framework
that integrates 3D occupancy representations into a unified multimodal
reasoning process. Unlike prior approaches that rely on explicit 3D inputs,
OccVLA treats dense 3D occupancy as both a predictive output and a supervisory
signal, enabling the model to learn fine-grained spatial structures directly
from 2D visual inputs. The occupancy predictions are regarded as implicit
reasoning processes and can be skipped during inference without performance
degradation, thereby adding no extra computational overhead. OccVLA achieves
state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes benchmark for trajectory planning and
demonstrates superior performance on 3D visual question-answering tasks,
offering a scalable, interpretable, and fully vision-based solution for
autonomous driving.

TL;DR: MSRFormer是一个多尺度道路网络表示学习框架，通过空间流卷积和图变换器处理道路网络的异质性和层次性，在道路网络分析任务中优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市道路网络具有异质性和层次性特点，传统图神经网络因同质性假设和单一尺度结构限制，难以准确学习道路网络表示。

Method: 使用空间流卷积从轨迹数据提取小尺度特征，识别尺度依赖的空间交互区域，通过图变换器捕获多尺度复杂空间依赖，采用残差连接融合特征，最后通过对比学习得到最终表示。

Result: 在两个真实数据集上的验证表明，MSRFormer在道路网络分析任务中优于基线方法，在复杂道路网络结构中相比最具竞争力的基线方法提升达16%。

Conclusion: 该研究为开发任务无关的道路网络表示模型提供了实用框架，揭示了尺度效应与空间交互流异质性之间的关联模式，表明交通相关任务更能从轨迹数据中受益。

Abstract: Transforming road network data into vector representations using deep
learning has proven effective for road network analysis. However, urban road
networks' heterogeneous and hierarchical nature poses challenges for accurate
representation learning. Graph neural networks, which aggregate features from
neighboring nodes, often struggle due to their homogeneity assumption and focus
on a single structural scale. To address these issues, this paper presents
MSRFormer, a novel road network representation learning framework that
integrates multi-scale spatial interactions by addressing their flow
heterogeneity and long-distance dependencies. It uses spatial flow convolution
to extract small-scale features from large trajectory datasets, and identifies
scale-dependent spatial interaction regions to capture the spatial structure of
road networks and flow heterogeneity. By employing a graph transformer,
MSRFormer effectively captures complex spatial dependencies across multiple
scales. The spatial interaction features are fused using residual connections,
which are fed to a contrastive learning algorithm to derive the final road
network representation. Validation on two real-world datasets demonstrates that
MSRFormer outperforms baseline methods in two road network analysis tasks. The
performance gains of MSRFormer suggest the traffic-related task benefits more
from incorporating trajectory data, also resulting in greater improvements in
complex road network structures with up to 16% improvements compared to the
most competitive baseline method. This research provides a practical framework
for developing task-agnostic road network representation models and highlights
distinct association patterns of the interplay between scale effects and flow
heterogeneity of spatial interactions.

Motivation: 现有基准主要关注认知层面的修改，缺乏对更深层次元认知过程的评估。需要填补这一空白，评估MLLMs在元认知知识编辑方面的能力。

Method: 提出MIND框架：构建元知识记忆用于自我意识，使用博弈论交互监控知识激活，并采用标签精炼实现噪声鲁棒更新。

Conclusion: CogEdit基准和MIND框架有效提升了多模态大语言模型的元认知知识编辑能力，为更深层次的知识更新提供了新思路。

Abstract: Knowledge editing enables multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to
efficiently update outdated or incorrect information. However, existing
benchmarks primarily emphasize cognitive-level modifications while lacking a
focus on deeper meta-cognitive processes. To bridge this gap, we introduce
CogEdit, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' meta-cognitive knowledge
editing abilities across three levels: (1) Counterfactual-Driven Editing,
assessing self-awareness of knowledge correctness changes; (2) Boundary
Constraint Editing, ensuring appropriate generalization without unintended
interference; and (3) Noise-Robust Editing, promoting reflective evaluation of
uncertain information. To advance meta-cognitive editing, we propose MIND
(Meta-cognitive INtegrated Dynamic Knowledge Editing), a framework that
constructs a meta-knowledge memory for self-awareness, employs game-theoretic
interactions to monitor knowledge activation, and incorporates label refinement
for noise-robust updates. Extensive experiments show that MIND significantly
outperforms existing cognitive editing approaches, achieving strong performance
on both traditional and meta-cognitive knowledge editing benchmarks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success and
demonstrated superior performance across various tasks, including natural
language processing (NLP), weather forecasting, biological protein folding,
text generation, and solving mathematical problems. However, many real-world
data exhibit highly non-Euclidean latent hierarchical anatomy, such as protein
networks, transportation networks, financial networks, brain networks, and
linguistic structures or syntactic trees in natural languages. Effectively
learning intrinsic semantic entailment and hierarchical relationships from
these raw, unstructured input data using LLMs remains an underexplored area.
Due to its effectiveness in modeling tree-like hierarchical structures,
hyperbolic geometry -- a non-Euclidean space -- has rapidly gained popularity
as an expressive latent representation space for complex data modeling across
domains such as graphs, images, languages, and multi-modal data. Here, we
provide a comprehensive and contextual exposition of recent advancements in
LLMs that leverage hyperbolic geometry as a representation space to enhance
semantic representation learning and multi-scale reasoning. Specifically, the
paper presents a taxonomy of the principal techniques of Hyperbolic LLMs
(HypLLMs) in terms of four main categories: (1) hyperbolic LLMs through exp/log
maps; (2) hyperbolic fine-tuned models; (3) fully hyperbolic LLMs, and (4)
hyperbolic state-space models. We also explore crucial potential applications
and outline future research directions. A repository of key papers, models,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的预测-优化（PTO）方法将预测和优化分离处理，导致预测错误传播到决策中，而新兴的DFL方法虽然集成了这两个步骤，但在真实应用中面临数据稀缺和变异性挑战。

Method: 提出AFE-DFL框架，通过自动特征工程提取更丰富的数据表征，在小数据集上实现电价和需求预测的同时优化BESS运营以最小化成本。

Result: 在英国真实房屋数据集上验证，DFL法比PTO法平均节省更多运营成本，而添加AFE后让DFL方法的性能提升22.9-56.5%。

Conclusion: 这些结果为DFL在真实应用中的可行性提供了实证支撑，领域特定的AFE能够增强DFL的效果，减少对领域专家知识的依赖，并产生经济效益，对面临类似挑战的能源管理系统具有广泛意义。

Abstract: Decision-making under uncertainty in energy management is complicated by
unknown parameters hindering optimal strategies, particularly in Battery Energy
Storage System (BESS) operations. Predict-Then-Optimise (PTO) approaches treat
forecasting and optimisation as separate processes, allowing prediction errors
to cascade into suboptimal decisions as models minimise forecasting errors
rather than optimising downstream tasks. The emerging Decision-Focused Learning
(DFL) methods overcome this limitation by integrating prediction and
optimisation; however, they are relatively new and have been tested primarily
on synthetic datasets or small-scale problems, with limited evidence of their
practical viability. Real-world BESS applications present additional
challenges, including greater variability and data scarcity due to collection
constraints and operational limitations. Because of these challenges, this work
leverages Automated Feature Engineering (AFE) to extract richer representations
and improve the nascent approach of DFL. We propose an AFE-DFL framework
suitable for small datasets that forecasts electricity prices and demand while
optimising BESS operations to minimise costs. We validate its effectiveness on
a novel real-world UK property dataset. The evaluation compares DFL methods
against PTO, with and without AFE. The results show that, on average, DFL
yields lower operating costs than PTO and adding AFE further improves the
performance of DFL methods by 22.9-56.5% compared to the same models without
AFE. These findings provide empirical evidence for DFL's practical viability in
real-world settings, indicating that domain-specific AFE enhances DFL and
reduces reliance on domain expertise for BESS optimisation, yielding economic
benefits with broader implications for energy management systems facing similar
challenges.

Abstract: Patients must possess the knowledge necessary to actively participate in
their care. We present NoteAid-Chatbot, a conversational AI that promotes
patient understanding via a novel 'learning as conversation' framework, built
on a multi-agent large language model (LLM) and reinforcement learning (RL)
setup without human-labeled data. NoteAid-Chatbot was built on a lightweight
LLaMA 3.2 3B model trained in two stages: initial supervised fine-tuning on
conversational data synthetically generated using medical conversation
strategies, followed by RL with rewards derived from patient understanding
assessments in simulated hospital discharge scenarios. Our evaluation, which
includes comprehensive human-aligned assessments and case studies, demonstrates
that NoteAid-Chatbot exhibits key emergent behaviors critical for patient
education, such as clarity, relevance, and structured dialogue, even though it
received no explicit supervision for these attributes. Our results show that
even simple Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based reward modeling can
successfully train lightweight, domain-specific chatbots to handle multi-turn
interactions, incorporate diverse educational strategies, and meet nuanced
communication objectives. Our Turing test demonstrates that NoteAid-Chatbot
surpasses non-expert human. Although our current focus is on healthcare, the
framework we present illustrates the feasibility and promise of applying
low-cost, PPO-based RL to realistic, open-ended conversational domains,
broadening the applicability of RL-based alignment methods.

Abstract: Agentic AI has significantly extended the capabilities of large language
models (LLMs) by enabling complex reasoning and tool use. However, most
existing frameworks are tailored to domains such as mathematics, coding, or web
automation, and fall short on geospatial tasks that require spatial reasoning,
multi-hop planning, and real-time map interaction. To address these challenges,
we introduce MapAgent, a hierarchical multi-agent plug-and-play framework with
customized toolsets and agentic scaffolds for map-integrated geospatial
reasoning. Unlike existing flat agent-based approaches that treat tools
uniformly-often overwhelming the LLM when handling similar but subtly different
geospatial APIs-MapAgent decouples planning from execution. A high-level
planner decomposes complex queries into subgoals, which are routed to
specialized modules. For tool-heavy modules-such as map-based services-we then
design a dedicated map-tool agent that efficiently orchestrates related APIs
adaptively in parallel to effectively fetch geospatial data relevant for the
query, while simpler modules (e.g., solution generation or answer extraction)
operate without additional agent overhead. This hierarchical design reduces
cognitive load, improves tool selection accuracy, and enables precise
coordination across similar APIs. We evaluate MapAgent on four diverse
geospatial benchmarks-MapEval-Textual, MapEval-API, MapEval-Visual, and
MapQA-and demonstrate substantial gains over state-of-the-art tool-augmented
and agentic baselines. We open-source our framwork at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了DRER强化学习奖励框架，通过推理质量奖励和动态长度优势来优化语言模型的推理能力，在Logictree数据集上7B模型达到GPT-3水平，推理置信度提升30%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于规则的奖励函数只评估答案格式和正确性，无法判断推理链是否真正改善答案，且任务特定训练对逻辑深度的控制有限

Method: DRER框架包含：(1)推理质量奖励-对提升正确答案可能性的推理链进行细粒度奖励；(2)动态长度优势-对偏离验证阈值的响应长度进行优势衰减

Result: 7B模型在400训练步数下达到GPT-3水平，推理增强答案的平均置信度提升30%，在多种逻辑推理数据集和AIME24数学基准上表现出泛化能力

Conclusion: DRER有效塑造了CoT行为，为增强大语言模型的形式推理能力提供了实用路径

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become the dominant paradigm for
strengthening the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Yet the
rule-based reward functions commonly used on mathematical or programming
benchmarks assess only answer format and correctness, providing no signal as to
whether the induced Chain-of-Thought (CoT) actually improves the answer.
Furthermore, such task-specific training offers limited control over logical
depth and therefore may fail to reveal a model's genuine reasoning capacity. We
propose Dynamic Reasoning Efficiency Reward (DRER) -- a plug-and-play RL reward
framework that reshapes both reward and advantage signals. (i) A Reasoning
Quality Reward assigns fine-grained credit to those reasoning chains that
demonstrably raise the likelihood of the correct answer, directly incentivising
the trajectories with beneficial CoT tokens. (ii) A Dynamic Length Advantage
decays the advantage of responses whose length deviates from a
validation-derived threshold, stabilising training. To facilitate rigorous
assessment, we also release Logictree, a dynamically constructed deductive
reasoning dataset that functions both as RL training data and as a
comprehensive benchmark. Experiments confirm the effectiveness of DRER: our 7B
model attains GPT-o3-mini level performance on Logictree with 400 trianing
steps, while the average confidence of CoT-augmented answers rises by 30%. The
model further exhibits generalisation across diverse logical-reasoning
datasets, and the mathematical benchmark AIME24. These results illuminate how
RL shapes CoT behaviour and chart a practical path toward enhancing
formal-reasoning skills in large language models. All code and data are
available in repository https://github.com/Henryhe09/DRER.

<details>

Motivation: 传统深度推理方法在开放式创作任务中存在明显不足：强化学习缺乏明确奖励信号，指令蒸馏成本高昂且受限于教师模型能力

Method: 提出REER（逆向工程推理）范式，从已知优质解决方案反向计算推导出潜在的逐步深度推理过程，采用可扩展的无梯度方法

Result: 构建了DeepWriting-20K大规模数据集（2万条深度推理轨迹），DeepWriter-8B模型在性能上超越开源基线，与GPT-4o和Claude 3.5等专有模型竞争甚至更优

Conclusion: REER范式为开放式创作任务的深度推理提供了新的有效途径，通过逆向工程方法成功解决了传统方法的局限性

Abstract: While the ``deep reasoning'' paradigm has spurred significant advances in
verifiable domains like mathematics, its application to open-ended, creative
generation remains a critical challenge. The two dominant methods for
instilling reasoning -- reinforcement learning (RL) and instruction
distillation -- falter in this area; RL struggles with the absence of clear
reward signals and high-quality reward models, while distillation is
prohibitively expensive and capped by the teacher model's capabilities. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce REverse-Engineered Reasoning (REER), a
new paradigm that fundamentally shifts the approach. Instead of building a
reasoning process ``forwards'' through trial-and-error or imitation, REER works
``backwards'' from known-good solutions to computationally discover the latent,
step-by-step deep reasoning process that could have produced them. Using this
scalable, gradient-free approach, we curate and open-source DeepWriting-20K, a
large-scale dataset of 20,000 deep reasoning trajectories for open-ended tasks.
Our model, DeepWriter-8B, trained on this data, not only surpasses strong
open-source baselines but also achieves performance competitive with, and at
times superior to, leading proprietary models like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5.

TL;DR: EDIT是一种测试时缩放方法，通过约束引导生成和联合跟踪长度与答案分布，帮助大型推理模型找到最短的正确推理路径，平衡简洁性和正确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型(LRMs)在处理简单问题时容易过度思考，产生冗长复杂的推理轨迹，影响可解释性和效率。研究发现LRMs难以平衡正确性和简洁性等多个生成目标。

Method: 提出EDIT方法，采用约束引导生成，同时在不同约束下联合跟踪长度和答案分布，选择在简洁性和正确性之间达到最优平衡的响应。

Result: 在多种模型和数据集上的广泛实验表明，EDIT显著提高了推理效率，产生紧凑且信息丰富的输出，改善了可读性和用户体验。

Conclusion: EDIT方法有效解决了大型推理模型的过度思考问题，通过动态推理修剪实现了推理效率的显著提升，为复杂推理任务提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: O1/R1 style large reasoning models (LRMs) signal a substantial leap forward
over conventional instruction-following LLMs. By applying test-time scaling to
generate extended reasoning paths, they establish many SOTAs across a wide
range of complex reasoning tasks. However, recent studies show that LRMs are
prone to suffer from overthinking -- the tendency to overcomplicate simple
problems, leading to excessive strategy switching and long, convoluted
reasoning traces that hinder their interpretability. To mitigate this issue, we
conduct a systematic investigation into the reasoning efficiency of a broad set
of LRMs and uncover a common dilemma: the difficulty in balancing multiple
generation objectives such as correctness and brevity. Based on this discovery,
we propose a test-time scaling method, EDIT (Efficient Dynamic Inference
Trimming), which efficiently guides LRMs to identify the shortest correct
reasoning paths at test time. EDIT employs constraint-guided generation while
jointly tracking length and answer distributions under varying constraints,
allowing it to select responses that strike an optimal balance between
conciseness and correctness. Extensive experiments across diverse models and
datasets show that EDIT substantially enhance the reasoning efficiency,
producing compact yet informative outputs that improve readability and user
experience.

PillagerBench, a novel framework for evaluating multi-agent systems in

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在代码生成方面表现优异，但生成的代码经常无法通过形式化验证，这在硬件和安全关键领域是基本要求。需要开发能够确保形式化验证正确性的自动化方法。

Method: 1) 使用PREFACE的验证器驱动RL代理迭代优化提示生成，确保Dafny代码正确性；2) 自动将验证后的Dafny程序转换为可综合的高级C代码；3) 使用Vivado HLS生成RTL实现。

Result: PREFACE的RL引导提示优化将Dafny验证成功率提高了21%，Proof2Silicon实现了高达72%的端到端硬件合成成功率，成功生成RTL设计。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了一个强大、可扩展且自动化的流水线，能够实现LLM驱动的形式化验证硬件合成，连接自然语言规范和硅实现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
automated code generation but frequently produce code that fails formal
verification, an essential requirement for hardware and safety-critical
domains. To overcome this fundamental limitation, we previously proposed
PREFACE, a model-agnostic framework based on reinforcement learning (RL) that
iteratively repairs the prompts provided to frozen LLMs, systematically
steering them toward generating formally verifiable Dafny code without costly
fine-tuning. This work presents Proof2Silicon, a novel end-to-end synthesis
framework that embeds the previously proposed PREFACE flow to enable the
generation of correctness-by-construction hardware directly from natural
language specifications. Proof2Silicon operates by: (1) leveraging PREFACE's
verifier-driven RL agent to optimize prompt generation iteratively, ensuring
Dafny code correctness; (2) automatically translating verified Dafny programs
into synthesizable high-level C using Dafny's Python backend and PyLog; and (3)
employing Vivado HLS to produce RTL implementations. Evaluated rigorously on a
challenging 100-task benchmark, PREFACE's RL-guided prompt optimization
consistently improved Dafny verification success rates across diverse LLMs by
up to 21%. Crucially, Proof2Silicon achieved an end-to-end hardware synthesis
success rate of up to 72%, generating RTL designs through Vivado HLS synthesis
flows. These results demonstrate a robust, scalable, and automated pipeline for
LLM-driven, formally verified hardware synthesis, bridging natural-language
specification and silicon realization.

Method: 使用个人因果图谱记录用户生活事件和习惯，通过目标导向的因果遍历、外部知识增强和假设推理，结合可适应计划模式生成定制行动方案，由大语言模型协调所有组件

Result: 基于CSM的智能体相比基线LLM智能体能够提供更上下文感知、用户对齐的推荐

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了在个性化智能体中实现记忆增强因果推理的新方法，推动了透明可信AI生活方式助手的发展

Abstract: Personalized AI assistants often struggle to incorporate complex personal
data and causal knowledge, leading to generic advice that lacks explanatory
power. We propose REMI, a Causal Schema Memory architecture for a multimodal
lifestyle agent that integrates a personal causal knowledge graph, a causal
reasoning engine, and a schema based planning module. The idea is to deliver
explainable, personalized recommendations in domains like fashion, personal
wellness, and lifestyle planning. Our architecture uses a personal causal graph
of the user's life events and habits, performs goal directed causal traversals
enriched with external knowledge and hypothetical reasoning, and retrieves
adaptable plan schemas to generate tailored action plans. A Large Language
Model orchestrates these components, producing answers with transparent causal
explanations. We outline the CSM system design and introduce new evaluation
metrics for personalization and explainability, including Personalization
Salience Score and Causal Reasoning Accuracy, to rigorously assess its
performance. Results indicate that CSM based agents can provide more context
aware, user aligned recommendations compared to baseline LLM agents. This work
demonstrates a novel approach to memory augmented, causal reasoning in
personalized agents, advancing the development of transparent and trustworthy
AI lifestyle assistants.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本方法在复杂数值计算和细粒度操作上表现不佳，工具集成方法又缺乏真正的自主适应性，需要开发更强大的表格推理系统

Method: 采用两阶段微调范式：先在高质量推理轨迹上进行监督微调建立工具使用模式，然后通过强化微调优化多目标策略，特别提出Rank-Aware Policy Optimization (RAPO)方法

Result: 在多个主流基准测试中，TableMind相比竞争基线实现了卓越性能，在推理准确性和计算精度方面都有显著提升

Conclusion: TableMind通过自主工具调用、代码执行和自适应策略，为表格推理任务提供了有效的解决方案，在准确性和精度方面都表现出色

Abstract: Table reasoning is crucial for leveraging structured data in domains such as
finance, healthcare, and scientific research. While large language models
(LLMs) show promise in multi-step reasoning, purely text-based methods often
struggle with the complex numerical computations and fine-grained operations
inherently required in this task. Tool-integrated reasoning improves
computational accuracy via explicit code execution, yet existing systems
frequently rely on rigid patterns, supervised imitation, and lack true
autonomous adaptability. In this paper, we present TableMind, an LLM-driven
table reasoning agent that (i) autonomously performs multi-turn tool
invocation, (ii) writes and executes data-analyzing code in a secure sandbox
environment for data analysis and precise numerical reasoning, and (iii)
exhibits high-level capabilities such as planning and self-reflection to adapt
strategies. To realize these capabilities, we adopt a two-stage fine-tuning
paradigm built on top of a powerful pre-trained language model: supervised
fine-tuning on high-quality reasoning trajectories to establish effective tool
usage patterns, followed by reinforcement fine-tuning to optimize
multi-objective strategies. In particular, we propose Rank-Aware Policy
Optimization (RAPO), which increases the update weight of high-quality
trajectories when their output probabilities are lower than those of
low-quality ones, thereby guiding the model more consistently toward better and
more accurate answers. Extensive experiments on several mainstream benchmarks
demonstrate that TableMind achieves superior performance compared to
competitive baselines, yielding substantial gains in both reasoning accuracy
and computational precision.

Conclusion: 自主单智能体模型通过持续强化学习可以有效提升深度研究能力，同时保持推理能力

Abstract: Equipping large language models (LLMs) with complex, interleaved reasoning
and tool-use capabilities has become a key focus in agentic AI research,
especially with recent advances in reasoning-oriented (``thinking'') models.
Such capabilities are key to unlocking a number of important applications. One
such application is Deep Research (DR), which requires extensive search and
reasoning over many sources. Our work in this paper focuses on the development
of native Autonomous Single-Agent models for DR featuring minimal web crawling
and Python tool integration. Unlike multi-agent systems, where agents take up
pre-defined roles and are told what to do at each step in a static workflow, an
autonomous single-agent determines its next action dynamically based on
context, without manual directive. While prior work has proposed training
recipes for base or instruction-tuned LLMs, we focus on continual reinforcement
learning (RL) of reasoning-optimized models to further enhance agentic skills
while preserving reasoning ability. Towards this end, we propose a simple RL
recipe with entirely synthetic data, which we apply to various open-source
LLMs. Our best variant SFR-DR-20B achieves up to 28.7% on Humanity's Last Exam
benchmark. In addition, we conduct key analysis experiments to provide more
insights into our methodologies.

Method: 从成功轨迹中提取结构化推理模式，从失败中获取反思信号；在推理过程中逐步遵循指导原则，每一步后进行精炼以纠正错误和稳定推理过程。

Result: 在BBH、GSM8K、MATH-500、MBPP、HumanEval等多个基准测试中 consistently 超越强基线，表现出更好的稳定性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 结构化推理与逐步执行和精炼相结合的方法提高了推理质量，指导原则具有良好的跨领域迁移能力，支持跨模型协作，在效果和可扩展性上达到或超越监督微调。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced general-purpose reasoning, showing
strong performance across diverse tasks. However, existing methods often rely
on implicit exploration, where the model follows stochastic and unguided
reasoning paths-like walking without a map. This leads to unstable reasoning
paths, lack of error correction, and limited learning from past experience. To
address these issues, we propose a framework that shifts from implicit
exploration to structured reasoning through guideline and refinement. First, we
extract structured reasoning patterns from successful trajectories and
reflective signals from failures. During inference, the model follows these
guidelines step-by-step, with refinement applied after each step to correct
errors and stabilize the reasoning process. Experiments on BBH and four
additional benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH-500, MBPP, HumanEval) show that our method
consistently outperforms strong baselines across diverse reasoning tasks.
Structured reasoning with stepwise execution and refinement improves stability
and generalization, while guidelines transfer well across domains and flexibly
support cross-model collaboration, matching or surpassing supervised
fine-tuning in effectiveness and scalability.

Motivation: 传统能源改造决策方法存在普遍性和可解释性不足的问题，智能连接社区和生成式AI的发展为处理上下文信息和生成可读建议提供了新机遇

Method: 评估7种大语言模型(ChatGPT、DeepSeek、Gemini等)在两种目标(最大化CO2减排、最小化回报期)下的居住改造决策，使用美国49个州400家庭的数据集，从准确性、一致性、敏感性和推理能力四个维度进行评估

Result: LLM在许多情况下能生成有效建议，无需微调即可达到第1名54.5%和前5名92.8%的匹配率，在技术目标上表现更优。模型间一致性低，高性能模型偏离其他模型，对地理位置和建筑形状敏感，但对技术和使用者行为敏感性较低

Conclusion: 大语言模型在能源改造决策中展现了作为协助工具的潜力，但需要在准确性、一致性和上下文处理方面进一步改进才能实现可靠应用

Abstract: Conventional approaches to building energy retrofit decision making suffer
from limited generalizability and low interpretability, hindering adoption in
diverse residential contexts. With the growth of Smart and Connected
Communities, generative AI, especially large language models (LLMs), may help
by processing contextual information and producing practitioner readable
recommendations. We evaluate seven LLMs (ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Gemini, Grok,
Llama, and Claude) on residential retrofit decisions under two objectives:
maximizing CO2 reduction (technical) and minimizing payback period
(sociotechnical). Performance is assessed on four dimensions: accuracy,
consistency, sensitivity, and reasoning, using a dataset of 400 homes across 49
US states. LLMs generate effective recommendations in many cases, reaching up
to 54.5 percent top 1 match and 92.8 percent within top 5 without fine tuning.
Performance is stronger for the technical objective, while sociotechnical
decisions are limited by economic trade offs and local context. Agreement
across models is low, and higher performing models tend to diverge from others.
LLMs are sensitive to location and building geometry but less sensitive to
technology and occupant behavior. Most models show step by step, engineering
style reasoning, but it is often simplified and lacks deeper contextual
awareness. Overall, LLMs are promising assistants for energy retrofit decision
making, but improvements in accuracy, consistency, and context handling are
needed for reliable practice.

Abstract: Questionnaire-based surveys are foundational to social science research and
public policymaking, yet traditional survey methods remain costly,
time-consuming, and often limited in scale. This paper explores a new paradigm:
simulating virtual survey respondents using Large Language Models (LLMs). We
introduce two novel simulation settings, namely Partial Attribute Simulation
(PAS) and Full Attribute Simulation (FAS), to systematically evaluate the
ability of LLMs to generate accurate and demographically coherent responses. In
PAS, the model predicts missing attributes based on partial respondent
profiles, whereas FAS involves generating complete synthetic datasets under
both zero-context and context-enhanced conditions. We curate a comprehensive
benchmark suite, LLM-S^3 (Large Language Model-based Sociodemographic Survey
Simulation), that spans 11 real-world public datasets across four sociological
domains. Our evaluation of multiple mainstream LLMs (GPT-3.5/4 Turbo, LLaMA
3.0/3.1-8B) reveals consistent trends in prediction performance, highlights
failure modes, and demonstrates how context and prompt design impact simulation
fidelity. This work establishes a rigorous foundation for LLM-driven survey

Abstract: In online second-hand marketplaces, multi-turn bargaining is a crucial part
of seller-buyer interactions. Large Language Models (LLMs) can act as seller
agents, negotiating with buyers on behalf of sellers under given business
constraints. A critical ability for such agents is to track and accurately
interpret cumulative buyer intents across long negotiations, which directly
impacts bargaining effectiveness. We introduce a multi-turn evaluation
framework for measuring the bargaining ability of seller agents in e-commerce
dialogues. The framework tests whether an agent can extract and track buyer
intents. Our contributions are: (1) a large-scale e-commerce bargaining
benchmark spanning 622 categories, 9,892 products, and 3,014 tasks; (2) a
turn-level evaluation framework grounded in Theory of Mind (ToM) with annotated
buyer intents, moving beyond outcome-only metrics; and (3) an automated

Conclusion: DECOY提供了一个有价值的工具，可用于推进战略多智能体规划和行为生成的研究。该模拟器在保持计算效率的同时实现了高度的环境保真度。

Abstract: Modern simulation environments for complex multi-agent interactions must
balance high-fidelity detail with computational efficiency. We present DECOY, a
novel multi-agent simulator that abstracts strategic, long-horizon planning in
3D terrains into high-level discretized simulation while preserving low-level
environmental fidelity. Using Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) as a
testbed, our framework accurately simulates gameplay using only movement
decisions as tactical positioning -- without explicitly modeling low-level
mechanics such as aiming and shooting. Central to our approach is a waypoint
system that simplifies and discretizes continuous states and actions, paired
with neural predictive and generative models trained on real CS:GO tournament
data to reconstruct event outcomes. Extensive evaluations show that replays
generated from human data in DECOY closely match those observed in the original
game. Our publicly available simulation environment provides a valuable tool
for advancing research in strategic multi-agent planning and behavior
generation.

Motivation: 开发可解释且具备诊断能力的AI系统，通过利用非结构化临床叙述作为监督信号，模拟放射科医生的逐步推理过程。

Method: 结合对比图像-报告调优进行领域对齐，使用思维链监督捕捉推理逻辑，并通过临床奖励信号进行强化调优以提高事实准确性和流畅性。

Result: 在MIMIC-CXR基准测试中，零样本疾病分类AUC从0.52提升至0.76，病理定位mIoU从0.08提升至0.31，报告生成BLEU从0.11提升至0.33，在长尾疾病和外部数据集上优于最先进模型。

Conclusion: DiagCoT通过将非结构化临床叙述转化为结构化监督，为开发可解释且具备诊断能力的放射学AI系统提供了可扩展的方法。

Abstract: This study presents DiagCoT, a multi-stage framework that applies supervised
fine-tuning to general-purpose vision-language models (VLMs) to emulate
radiologists' stepwise diagnostic reasoning using only free-text reports.
DiagCoT combines contrastive image-report tuning for domain alignment,
chain-of-thought supervision to capture inferential logic, and reinforcement
tuning with clinical reward signals to enhance factual accuracy and fluency. On
the MIMIC-CXR benchmark, DiagCoT improved zero-shot disease classification AUC
from 0.52 to 0.76 (absolute gain of 0.24), pathology grounding mIoU from 0.08
to 0.31 (absolute gain of 0.23), and report generation BLEU from 0.11 to 0.33
(absolute gain of 0.22). It outperformed state-of-the-art models including
LLaVA-Med and CXR-LLAVA on long-tailed diseases and external datasets. By
converting unstructured clinical narratives into structured supervision,
DiagCoT offers a scalable approach for developing interpretable and
diagnostically competent AI systems for radiology.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Tree of Agents (TOA)多智能体推理框架，通过将长输入分段处理、动态信息交换和树状结构协作，有效解决LLM长上下文处理中的中间信息丢失问题，在保持较低API开销的同时显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在处理长上下文任务时面临的中间信息丢失问题，现有方法要么可能丢弃关键信息，要么导致注意力分散，需要一种更有效的方法来充分利用长输入中的所有信息。

Method: TOA多智能体推理框架：1) 将输入分段由独立智能体处理；2) 每个智能体生成局部认知；3) 沿树状结构路径动态交换信息进行协作推理；4) 采用前缀哈希缓存和自适应剪枝策略提高效率。

Result: 实验表明，基于紧凑型LLaMA3.1-8B的TOA显著优于多个基线模型，在多种长上下文任务上表现与最新大型商业模型（如Gemini1.5-pro）相当，同时保持可比的API开销。

Conclusion: TOA框架通过多智能体协作和树状推理结构，有效缓解了位置偏见和幻觉问题，为长上下文处理提供了一种高效且性能优异的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face persistent challenges when handling
long-context tasks, most notably the lost in the middle issue, where
information located in the middle of a long input tends to be underutilized.
Some existing methods that reduce input have the risk of discarding key
information, while others that extend context windows often lead to attention
dispersion. To address these limitations, we propose Tree of Agents (TOA), a
multi-agent reasoning framework that segments the input into chunks processed
by independent agents. Each agent generates its local cognition, then agents
dynamically exchange information for collaborative reasoning along
tree-structured paths. TOA enables agents to probe different reasoning orders
for multi-perspective understanding, effectively mitigating position bias and
reducing hallucinations. To improve processing efficiency, we incorporate
prefix-hash caching and adaptive pruning strategies, achieving significant
performance improvements with comparable API overhead. Experiments show that
TOA, powered by compact LLaMA3.1-8B, significantly outperforms multiple
baselines and demonstrates comparable performance to the latest and much larger
commercial models, such as Gemini1.5-pro, on various long-context tasks. Code

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HyFedRAG是一个针对混合数据模态的联邦RAG框架，通过边缘-云协作机制在保护隐私的同时处理异构医疗数据，包括SQL、知识图谱和临床文档。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 集中式RAG系统在处理异构和隐私敏感的医疗数据时面临困难，特别是在分布式医疗环境中，传统云基RAG系统无法有效处理多样化格式和边缘设备的数据检索需求。

Method: 基于Flower设计边缘-云协作RAG框架，边缘侧LLM将多样化数据转换为标准化隐私保护表示，服务器侧LLM进行全局推理和生成；集成轻量级本地检索器和隐私感知LLM，提供三种匿名化工具；设计三层缓存策略优化延迟。

Result: 在PMC-Patients数据集上的实验表明，HyFedRAG在检索质量、生成一致性和系统效率方面优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为结构化异构数据上的RAG提供了可扩展且符合隐私要求的解决方案，在敏感和多样化数据环境中释放了LLMs的潜力。

Abstract: Centralized RAG pipelines struggle with heterogeneous and privacy-sensitive
data, especially in distributed healthcare settings where patient data spans
SQL, knowledge graphs, and clinical notes. Clinicians face difficulties
retrieving rare disease cases due to privacy constraints and the limitations of
traditional cloud-based RAG systems in handling diverse formats and edge
devices. To address this, we introduce HyFedRAG, a unified and efficient
Federated RAG framework tailored for Hybrid data modalities. By leveraging an
edge-cloud collaborative mechanism, HyFedRAG enables RAG to operate across
diverse data sources while preserving data privacy. Our key contributions are:
(1) We design an edge-cloud collaborative RAG framework built on Flower, which
supports querying structured SQL data, semi-structured knowledge graphs, and
unstructured documents. The edge-side LLMs convert diverse data into
standardized privacy-preserving representations, and the server-side LLMs
integrates them for global reasoning and generation. (2) We integrate
lightweight local retrievers with privacy-aware LLMs and provide three
anonymization tools that enable each client to produce semantically rich,
de-identified summaries for global inference across devices. (3) To optimize
response latency and reduce redundant computation, we design a three-tier
caching strategy consisting of local cache, intermediate representation cache,
and cloud inference cache. Experimental results on PMC-Patients demonstrate
that HyFedRAG outperforms existing baselines in terms of retrieval quality,
generation consistency, and system efficiency. Our framework offers a scalable
and privacy-compliant solution for RAG over structural-heterogeneous data,
unlocking the potential of LLMs in sensitive and diverse data environments.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的指令数据选择方法，通过最大化指令深度和语义覆盖率来持续提升大语言模型在下游任务中的对齐性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在下游任务中的应用需求增长，提升模型对齐性能和效率变得至关重要。但由于指令集分布的复杂性，当前方法无法随着指令池扩大而持续提升性能。

Method: 首先研究指令数据集分布与对齐模型性能关系的关键因素，发现指令深度和语义空间覆盖率是关键因素。然后设计指令选择算法同时最大化所选指令的深度和语义覆盖率。

Result: 实验结果表明，相比最先进的基线方法，该方法能够以更快的速度持续提升模型性能，实现"加速扩展"。指令深度和语义覆盖率可以解释开发集上超过70%的模型损失。

Conclusion: 指令深度和语义覆盖率是决定下游性能的关键因素，提出的指令选择方法能够有效提升大语言模型的对齐性能，实现可持续的性能改进。

Abstract: With the growing demand for applying large language models to downstream
tasks, improving model alignment performance and efficiency has become crucial.
Such a process involves selecting informative instructions from a candidate
pool. However, due to the complexity of instruction set distributions, the key
factors driving the performance of aligned models remain unclear. As a result,
current instruction set refinement methods fail to improve performance as the
instruction pool expands continuously. To address this issue, we first
investigate the key factors that influence the relationship between instruction
dataset distribution and aligned model performance. Based on these insights, we
propose a novel instruction data selection method. We identify that the depth
of instructions and the coverage of the semantic space are the crucial factors
determining downstream performance, which could explain over 70\% of the model
loss on the development set. We then design an instruction selection algorithm
to simultaneously maximize the depth and semantic coverage of the selected
instructions. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to
state-of-the-art baseline methods, it can sustainably improve model performance
at a faster pace and thus achieve \emph{``Accelerated Scaling''}.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏系统评估GUI操作与快捷方式（API、深度链接等）混合代理的基准测试框架，需要填补这一空白以推动更高效智能代理的发展。

Method: 构建包含139个跨11个真实应用复杂任务的基准测试，提供88个预定义快捷方式知识库，设计可通过GUI操作解决但能通过智能嵌入快捷方式显著加速的任务，使用7个评估指标。

Result: 实验显示混合代理相比纯GUI代理实现了显著更高的成功率和效率，证明了评估代理快捷方式生成能力的有效性。

Conclusion: MAS-Bench填补了关键评估空白，为创建更高效、鲁棒的智能代理提供了基础平台。

Abstract: To enhance the efficiency of GUI agents on various platforms like smartphones
and computers, a hybrid paradigm that combines flexible GUI operations with
efficient shortcuts (e.g., API, deep links) is emerging as a promising
direction. However, a framework for systematically benchmarking these hybrid
agents is still underexplored. To take the first step in bridging this gap, we
introduce MAS-Bench, a benchmark that pioneers the evaluation of GUI-shortcut
hybrid agents with a specific focus on the mobile domain. Beyond merely using
predefined shortcuts, MAS-Bench assesses an agent's capability to autonomously
generate shortcuts by discovering and creating reusable, low-cost workflows. It
features 139 complex tasks across 11 real-world applications, a knowledge base
of 88 predefined shortcuts (APIs, deep-links, RPA scripts), and 7 evaluation
metrics. The tasks are designed to be solvable via GUI-only operations, but can
be significantly accelerated by intelligently embedding shortcuts. Experiments
show that hybrid agents achieve significantly higher success rates and
efficiency than their GUI-only counterparts. This result also demonstrates the
effectiveness of our method for evaluating an agent's shortcut generation
capabilities. MAS-Bench fills a critical evaluation gap, providing a
foundational platform for future advancements in creating more efficient and
robust intelligent agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多目标优化方法在应对供应链的动态性和不确定性时适应性差，需要一种能够实时调整策略的灵活方法来平衡成本、服务水平和环境可持续性等多个相互冲突的目标。

Method: 结合强化学习(RL)和多目标进化算法(MOEAs)，利用MOEAs搜索策略神经网络的参数空间生成帕索托前沿，提供多样化策略。引入条件风险价值(CVaR)来支持风险敏感性决策。

Result: 通过案例研究验证了方法的有效性，能够响应供应链动态并在库存管理案例中超过现有最优方法。

Conclusion: 该策略不仅提高了决策效率，还为管理供应链中的不确定性和优化性能提供了更稳健的框架。

Abstract: In supply chain management, decision-making often involves balancing multiple
conflicting objectives, such as cost reduction, service level improvement, and
environmental sustainability. Traditional multi-objective optimization methods,
such as linear programming and evolutionary algorithms, struggle to adapt in
real-time to the dynamic nature of supply chains. In this paper, we propose an
approach that combines Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Multi-Objective
Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) to address these challenges for dynamic
multi-objective optimization under uncertainty. Our method leverages MOEAs to
search the parameter space of policy neural networks, generating a Pareto front
of policies. This provides decision-makers with a diverse population of
policies that can be dynamically switched based on the current system
objectives, ensuring flexibility and adaptability in real-time decision-making.
We also introduce Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) to incorporate
risk-sensitive decision-making, enhancing resilience in uncertain environments.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through case studies,
showcasing its ability to respond to supply chain dynamics and outperforming
state-of-the-art methods in an inventory management case study. The proposed
strategy not only improves decision-making efficiency but also offers a more
robust framework for managing uncertainty and optimizing performance in supply
chains.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在自动定理证明中面临训练时强化学习和推理时计算能力的双重扩展限制，需要解决性能平台期和搜索空间过大的问题。

Method: 1) 多回合离策略RL框架：采用AlphaZero启发的多阶段专家迭代流程，包含自适应策略级数据过滤和定期重训练；2) 规划增强的多智能体搜索架构：使用通用推理模型作为高层规划器分解复杂定理，并行证明器团队通过共享证明缓存协作。

Conclusion: 该系统在形式数学领域取得了突破性成果，其RL和推理技术对需要长视野多回合推理和复杂搜索的其他领域也具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into automated theorem
proving has shown immense promise, yet is fundamentally constrained by
challenges in scaling up both training-time reinforcement learning (RL) and
inference-time compute. This paper introduces \texttt{BFS-Prover-V2}, a system
designed to address this dual scaling problem. We present two primary
innovations. The first is a novel multi-turn off-policy RL framework for
continually improving the performance of LLM step-prover at training time. This
framework, inspired by the principles of AlphaZero, utilizes a multi-stage
expert iteration pipeline featuring adaptive tactic-level data filtering and
periodic retraining to surmount the performance plateaus that typically curtail
long-term RL in LLM-based agents. The second innovation is a planner-enhanced
multi-agent search architecture that scales reasoning capabilities at inference
time. This architecture employs a general reasoning model as a high-level
planner to iteratively decompose complex theorems into a sequence of simpler
subgoals. This hierarchical approach substantially reduces the search space,
enabling a team of parallel prover agents to collaborate efficiently by
leveraging a shared proof cache. We demonstrate that this dual approach to
scaling yields state-of-the-art results on established formal mathematics
benchmarks. \texttt{BFS-Prover-V2} achieves 95.08\% and 41.4\% on the MiniF2F
and ProofNet test sets respectively. While demonstrated in the domain of formal
mathematics, the RL and inference techniques presented in this work are of
broader interest and may be applied to other domains requiring long-horizon
multi-turn reasoning and complex search.

Motivation: 解决多模态大模型在复杂跨模态推理中存在的"短接"问题（依赖表面特征而非深层理解）和上下文理解不足的挑战。

Method: 设计了一个插拔式三模块流水线：意图感知器、策略生成器和策略选择器。通过明确构建"理解-规划-选择"的认知过程，生成并筛选"意图草笼"策略来指导最终推理。无需参数微调，仅通过上下文工程实现跨模型转移。

Conclusion: 信息论分析显示该方法能够降低条件熵以提高信息利用效率，压制意外的短接推理。"意图草笼"推理组件在零检验场景中具有实际价值和可移植性。

Abstract: Targeting the issues of "shortcuts" and insufficient contextual understanding
in complex cross-modal reasoning of multimodal large models, this paper
proposes a zero-shot multimodal reasoning component guided by human-like
cognitive strategies centered on an "intent sketch". The component comprises a
plug-and-play three-module pipeline-Intent Perceiver, Strategy Generator, and
Strategy Selector-that explicitly constructs a "understand-plan-select"
cognitive process. By generating and filtering "intent sketch" strategies to
guide the final reasoning, it requires no parameter fine-tuning and achieves
cross-model transfer solely through in-context engineering.
Information-theoretic analysis shows that this process can reduce conditional
entropy and improve information utilization efficiency, thereby suppressing
unintended shortcut reasoning. Experiments on IntentBench, WorldSense, and
Daily-Omni validate the method's generality and robust gains; compared with
their respective baselines, the complete "three-module" scheme yields
consistent improvements across different reasoning engines and pipeline
combinations, with gains up to approximately 9.51 percentage points,
demonstrating the practical value and portability of the "intent sketch"
reasoning component in zero-shot scenarios.

Motivation: 当前深度研究系统存在训练方法的局限性：SFT存在模仿偏差和暴露偏差，DPO则依赖于代理指标且在长远期价值分配方面较弱。强化学习能够通过优化轨迹级策略、支持探索和恢复行为、减少对人类偏见的依赖，因此更适合闭环工具交互的研究任务。

Abstract: Deep research systems, agentic AI that solve complex, multi-step tasks by
coordinating reasoning, search across the open web and user files, and tool
use, are moving toward hierarchical deployments with a Planner, Coordinator,
and Executors. In practice, training entire stacks end-to-end remains
impractical, so most work trains a single planner connected to core tools such
as search, browsing, and code. While SFT imparts protocol fidelity, it suffers
from imitation and exposure biases and underuses environment feedback.
Preference alignment methods such as DPO are schema and proxy-dependent,
off-policy, and weak for long-horizon credit assignment and multi-objective
trade-offs. A further limitation of SFT and DPO is their reliance on human
defined decision points and subskills through schema design and labeled
comparisons. Reinforcement learning aligns with closed-loop, tool-interaction
research by optimizing trajectory-level policies, enabling exploration,
recovery behaviors, and principled credit assignment, and it reduces dependence
on such human priors and rater biases.
  This survey is, to our knowledge, the first dedicated to the RL foundations
of deep research systems. It systematizes work after DeepSeek-R1 along three
axes: (i) data synthesis and curation; (ii) RL methods for agentic research
covering stability, sample efficiency, long context handling, reward and credit
design, multi-objective optimization, and multimodal integration; and (iii)
agentic RL training systems and frameworks. We also cover agent architecture
and coordination, as well as evaluation and benchmarks, including recent QA,
VQA, long-form synthesis, and domain-grounded, tool-interaction tasks. We
distill recurring patterns, surface infrastructure bottlenecks, and offer
practical guidance for training robust, transparent deep research agents with
RL.

Method: 开发了VehicleWorld环境（30个模块、250个API、680个属性），并提出SFC方法，通过维护显式系统状态感知和直接状态转换来实现目标条件

Result: SFC方法在实验结果显示显著优于传统FC方法，实现了更高的执行精度和更低的延迟

Conclusion: 直接状态预测方法在车辆环境控制方面优于功能调用，SFC为智能座舱API代理提供了更高效的解决方案

Abstract: Intelligent vehicle cockpits present unique challenges for API Agents,
requiring coordination across tightly-coupled subsystems that exceed typical
task environments' complexity. Traditional Function Calling (FC) approaches
operate statelessly, requiring multiple exploratory calls to build
environmental awareness before execution, leading to inefficiency and limited
error recovery. We introduce VehicleWorld, the first comprehensive environment
for the automotive domain, featuring 30 modules, 250 APIs, and 680 properties
with fully executable implementations that provide real-time state information
during agent execution. This environment enables precise evaluation of vehicle
agent behaviors across diverse, challenging scenarios. Through systematic
analysis, we discovered that direct state prediction outperforms function
calling for environmental control. Building on this insight, we propose
State-based Function Call (SFC), a novel approach that maintains explicit
system state awareness and implements direct state transitions to achieve
target conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that SFC significantly
outperforms traditional FC approaches, achieving superior execution accuracy
and reduced latency. We have made all implementation code publicly available on

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个评估迭代精细化的框架，用于测量大语言模型在多轮工作流中的表现，发现不同领域的迭代效果差异显著，且指导性提示比模糊反馈更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型已经被广泛用于多轮工作流，但仍缺乏明确的方法来评估迭代经过的作用，旨在提供一个统一的评测标准。

Method: 设计了12轮的受控对话协议，使用从模糊"改进它"到有针对性指导的各种提示策略，并记录每轮输出。采用领域适应性检查（代码单元测试、数学答案等价性和推理合理性、想法的原创性和可行性）进行评分。

Result: 越过模型和任务，收获在不同领域中差异显著：想法和代码在早期轮次就有收获，而数学需要后期轮次的详细调整。模糊反馈往往在前几轮后就停滞或反向降低正确性，而有针对性的提示能稳定改善输出质量。

Conclusion: 该框架和指标使迭代过程可测量化并在不同模型间可比较，为如何指导、停止或切换策略提供了明确信号。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now used in multi-turn workflows, but we
still lack a clear way to measure when iteration helps and when it hurts. We
present an evaluation framework for iterative refinement that spans ideation,
code, and math. Our protocol runs controlled 12-turn conversations per task,
utilizing a variety of prompts ranging from vague ``improve it'' feedback to
targeted steering, and logs per-turn outputs. We score outcomes with
domain-appropriate checks (unit tests for code; answer-equivalence plus
reasoning-soundness for math; originality and feasibility for ideation) and
track turn-level behavior with three families of metrics: semantic movement
across turns, turn-to-turn change, and output size growth. Across models and
tasks, gains are domain-dependent: they arrive early in ideas and code, but in
math late turns matter when guided by elaboration. After the first few turns,
vague feedback often plateaus or reverses correctness, while targeted prompts
reliably shift the intended quality axis (novelty vs. feasibility in ideation;
speed vs. readability in code; in math, elaboration outperforms exploration and
drives late-turn gains). We also observe consistent domain patterns: ideation
moves more in meaning across turns, code tends to grow in size with little
semantic change, and math starts fixed but can break that path with late,
elaborative iteration.Together, the framework and metrics make iteration
measurable and comparable across models, and signal when to steer, stop, or
switch strategies.

TL;DR: RAFFLES是一个用于评估长时程多组件LLM代理系统的迭代式评估架构，通过推理和迭代精化来识别系统故障点和原因，在故障检测准确率上显著超越现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM代理系统的评估方法存在局限，主要集中在单一指标、端到端结果和人类偏好上，无法有效识别长时程多组件系统中的故障点和原因。需要能够推理、探测、迭代和理解复杂逻辑的评估框架。

Method: RAFFLES采用迭代式多组件流水线架构，包含一个中央Judge系统性地调查故障，以及一组专门的Evaluators来评估系统组件和Judge自身的推理质量，建立假设历史。

Result: 在Who&When数据集上，RAFFLES在算法生成数据集上达到43%以上的代理-步骤故障对准确率（相比之前最佳16.6%大幅提升），在手工制作数据集上达到20%以上（超越之前最佳8.8%）。

Conclusion: RAFFLES代表了向自动化故障检测迈出的关键一步，能够替代劳动密集型的人工审查，为自主系统的故障诊断提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We have reached a critical roadblock in the development and enhancement of
long-horizon, multi-component LLM agentic systems: it is incredibly tricky to
identify where these systems break down and why. Evaluation capabilities that
currently exist today (e.g., single pass LLM-as-a-judge) are limited in that
they often focus on individual metrics or capabilities, end-to-end outcomes,
and are narrowly grounded on the preferences of humans. We argue that to match
the agentic capabilities, evaluation frameworks must also be able to reason,
probe, iterate, and understand the complex logic passing through these systems
over long horizons. In this paper, we present RAFFLES - an evaluation
architecture that incorporates reasoning and iterative refinement.
Specifically, RAFFLES operates as an iterative, multi-component pipeline, using
a central Judge to systematically investigate faults and a set of specialized
Evaluators to assess not only the system's components but also the quality of
the reasoning by the Judge itself, thereby building a history of hypotheses. We
tested RAFFLES against several baselines on the Who&When dataset, a benchmark
designed to diagnose the "who" (agent) and "when" (step) of a system's failure.
RAFFLES outperforms these baselines, achieving an agent-step fault pair
accuracy of over 43% on the Algorithmically-Generated dataset (a substantial
increase from the previously published best of 16.6%) and over 20% on the
Hand-Crafted dataset (surpassing the previously published best of 8.8%). These
results demonstrate a key step towards introducing automated fault detection
for autonomous systems over labor-intensive manual human review.

*James Xu Zhao,Bryan Hooi,See-Kiong Ng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 测试时扩展推理链在知识密集型任务中效果有限，不仅不能持续提升准确性，反而可能增加幻觉现象


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试时扩展通过增加推理链长度来提升模型性能，但在需要高事实准确性和低幻觉率的知识密集型任务中效果尚不明确，需要系统评估

Method: 使用12个推理模型在两个知识密集型基准测试上进行全面评估，分析扩展推理对幻觉行为的影响机制

Result: 增加测试时计算并不能持续提高准确性，反而经常导致更多幻觉；减少的幻觉主要来自模型选择弃权而非事实回忆改善；某些模型会因长推理而尝试回答之前未答问题，导致幻觉

Conclusion: 尽管存在局限性，启用思考相比不思考仍有益处；扩展推理可能引发确认偏误，导致过度自信的幻觉；需要更有效的方法来提升知识密集型任务的表现

Abstract: Test-time scaling increases inference-time computation by allowing models to
generate long reasoning chains, and has shown strong performance across many
domains. However, in this work, we show that this approach is not yet effective
for knowledge-intensive tasks, where high factual accuracy and low
hallucination rates are essential. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
test-time scaling using 12 reasoning models on two knowledge-intensive
benchmarks. Our results reveal that increasing test-time computation does not
consistently improve accuracy and, in many cases, it even leads to more
hallucinations. We then analyze how extended reasoning affects hallucination
behavior. We find that reduced hallucinations often result from the model
choosing to abstain after thinking more, rather than from improved factual
recall. Conversely, for some models, longer reasoning encourages attempts on
previously unanswered questions, many of which result in hallucinations. Case
studies show that extended reasoning can induce confirmation bias, leading to
overconfident hallucinations. Despite these limitations, we observe that
compared to non-thinking, enabling thinking remains beneficial. Code and data

TL;DR: Paper2Agent是一个将研究论文自动转换为AI代理的框架，通过分析论文和代码库构建MCP服务器，使静态论文变为可交互的智能研究助手。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统研究论文需要读者投入大量精力来理解和适应代码、数据和方法，这造成了传播和重用的障碍。Paper2Agent旨在将被动的研究成果转化为主动系统，加速下游使用和发现。

Method: 使用多个代理系统分析论文和关联代码库，构建Model Context Protocol (MCP)服务器，通过迭代生成和运行测试来优化MCP。然后将论文MCP与聊天代理连接，通过自然语言执行复杂科学查询。

Result: 通过深入案例研究验证了有效性，成功创建了基于AlphaGenome、ScanPy和TISSUE的论文代理，能够复现原始论文结果并正确执行新用户查询。

Conclusion: Paper2Agent通过将静态论文转化为动态交互的AI代理，为知识传播引入了新范式，为AI协作科学生态系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: We introduce Paper2Agent, an automated framework that converts research
papers into AI agents. Paper2Agent transforms research output from passive
artifacts into active systems that can accelerate downstream use, adoption, and
discovery. Conventional research papers require readers to invest substantial
effort to understand and adapt a paper's code, data, and methods to their own
work, creating barriers to dissemination and reuse. Paper2Agent addresses this
challenge by automatically converting a paper into an AI agent that acts as a
knowledgeable research assistant. It systematically analyzes the paper and the
associated codebase using multiple agents to construct a Model Context Protocol
(MCP) server, then iteratively generates and runs tests to refine and robustify
the resulting MCP. These paper MCPs can then be flexibly connected to a chat
agent (e.g. Claude Code) to carry out complex scientific queries through
natural language while invoking tools and workflows from the original paper. We
demonstrate Paper2Agent's effectiveness in creating reliable and capable paper
agents through in-depth case studies. Paper2Agent created an agent that
leverages AlphaGenome to interpret genomic variants and agents based on ScanPy
and TISSUE to carry out single-cell and spatial transcriptomics analyses. We
validate that these paper agents can reproduce the original paper's results and
can correctly carry out novel user queries. By turning static papers into
dynamic, interactive AI agents, Paper2Agent introduces a new paradigm for
knowledge dissemination and a foundation for the collaborative ecosystem of AI
co-scientists.

Conclusion: 该方法通过优化去噪过程和在线奖励调整，有效解决了现有模型的计算效率和调整灵活性问题，显著提升了图像生成质量

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of directly aligning
diffusion models with human preferences using differentiable reward. However,
they exhibit two primary challenges: (1) they rely on multistep denoising with
gradient computation for reward scoring, which is computationally expensive,
thus restricting optimization to only a few diffusion steps; (2) they often
need continuous offline adaptation of reward models in order to achieve desired
aesthetic quality, such as photorealism or precise lighting effects. To address
the limitation of multistep denoising, we propose Direct-Align, a method that
predefines a noise prior to effectively recover original images from any time
steps via interpolation, leveraging the equation that diffusion states are
interpolations between noise and target images, which effectively avoids
over-optimization in late timesteps. Furthermore, we introduce Semantic
Relative Preference Optimization (SRPO), in which rewards are formulated as
text-conditioned signals. This approach enables online adjustment of rewards in
response to positive and negative prompt augmentation, thereby reducing the
reliance on offline reward fine-tuning. By fine-tuning the FLUX.1.dev model
with optimized denoising and online reward adjustment, we improve its
human-evaluated realism and aesthetic quality by over 3x.
