### [1] [Image-Conditioned 3D Gaussian Splat Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15372)
*Xinshuang Liu,Runfa Blark Li,Keito Suzuki,Truong Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ICGS-Quantizer方法，通过联合利用高斯间和属性间相关性以及共享码本，将3D高斯溅射压缩到千字节级别，并支持基于图像的场景更新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS压缩方法存在两个限制：(1)只能将中等规模场景压缩到兆字节范围，不适用于大规模场景或场景集合；(2)缺乏适应长期归档后场景变化的机制。

Method: 提出图像条件高斯溅射量化器，联合利用高斯间和属性间相关性，使用跨所有训练场景的共享码本，并将编码、量化和解码过程联合训练，使量化代码能够进行条件解码。

Result: 实验结果表明ICGS-Quantizer在压缩效率和场景变化适应性方面持续优于最先进方法，将3DGS存储需求降低到千字节范围同时保持视觉保真度。

Conclusion: ICGS-Quantizer显著提升了压缩效率并提供了归档后场景变化的适应性，解决了现有方法的局限性，为3D场景的长期归档提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has attracted considerable attention for
enabling high-quality real-time rendering. Although 3DGS compression methods
have been proposed for deployment on storage-constrained devices, two
limitations hinder archival use: (1) they compress medium-scale scenes only to
the megabyte range, which remains impractical for large-scale scenes or
extensive scene collections; and (2) they lack mechanisms to accommodate scene
changes after long-term archival. To address these limitations, we propose an
Image-Conditioned Gaussian Splat Quantizer (ICGS-Quantizer) that substantially
enhances compression efficiency and provides adaptability to scene changes
after archiving. ICGS-Quantizer improves quantization efficiency by jointly
exploiting inter-Gaussian and inter-attribute correlations and by using shared
codebooks across all training scenes, which are then fixed and applied to
previously unseen test scenes, eliminating the overhead of per-scene codebooks.
This approach effectively reduces the storage requirements for 3DGS to the
kilobyte range while preserving visual fidelity. To enable adaptability to
post-archival scene changes, ICGS-Quantizer conditions scene decoding on images
captured at decoding time. The encoding, quantization, and decoding processes
are trained jointly, ensuring that the codes, which are quantized
representations of the scene, are effective for conditional decoding. We
evaluate ICGS-Quantizer on 3D scene compression and 3D scene updating.
Experimental results show that ICGS-Quantizer consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in compression efficiency and adaptability to scene
changes. Our code, model, and data will be publicly available on GitHub.

### [2] [Heatmap Regression without Soft-Argmax for Facial Landmark Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14929)
*Chiao-An Yang,Raymond A. Yeh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文挑战了面部关键点检测中长期使用的Soft-argmax方法，提出基于结构化预测框架的新训练目标，在多个基准测试中达到SOTA性能，训练收敛速度快2.2倍


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 热图回归方法在面部关键点检测中广泛使用，但argmax操作不可微分，传统使用Soft-argmax作为近似。作者认为这不是唯一的选择，需要探索替代方案

Method: 提出基于经典结构化预测框架的替代训练目标，避免了Soft-argmax的使用，实现了端到端的可微分训练

Result: 在WFLW、COFW和300W三个面部关键点基准测试中达到state-of-the-art性能，训练收敛速度快2.2倍，同时保持更好/有竞争力的准确率

Conclusion: Soft-argmax不是实现高性能的唯一途径，结构化预测框架提供了有效的替代方案，在准确性和训练效率方面都有显著提升

Abstract: Facial landmark detection is an important task in computer vision with
numerous applications, such as head pose estimation, expression analysis, face
swapping, etc. Heatmap regression-based methods have been widely used to
achieve state-of-the-art results in this task. These methods involve computing
the argmax over the heatmaps to predict a landmark. Since argmax is not
differentiable, these methods use a differentiable approximation, Soft-argmax,
to enable end-to-end training on deep-nets. In this work, we revisit this
long-standing choice of using Soft-argmax and demonstrate that it is not the
only way to achieve strong performance. Instead, we propose an alternative
training objective based on the classic structured prediction framework.
Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three facial
landmark benchmarks (WFLW, COFW, and 300W), converging 2.2x faster during
training while maintaining better/competitive accuracy. Our code is available
here: https://github.com/ca-joe-yang/regression-without-softarg.

### [3] [Scaling Group Inference for Diverse and High-Quality Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15773)
*Gaurav Parmar,Or Patashnik,Daniil Ostashev,Kuan-Chieh Wang,Kfir Aberman,Srinivasa Narasimhan,Jun-Yan Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种可扩展的组推理方法，通过将组推理建模为二次整数分配问题，在提高样本质量的同时最大化组多样性，解决了独立采样导致的冗余问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中用户通常需要获得一组多样化的输出结果，但传统生成模型的独立采样往往导致冗余结果，限制了用户选择和创意探索。

Method: 将组推理建模为二次整数分配问题：候选输出作为图节点，通过优化样本质量（一元项）和最大化组多样性（二元项）来选择子集；采用渐进式剪枝策略提高运行时效率。

Result: 实验表明该方法相比独立采样基线和最新推理算法，显著提高了组多样性和质量，可广泛应用于文本到图像、图像到图像、图像提示和视频生成等任务。

Conclusion: 该框架使生成模型能够将多个输出视为有凝聚力的组而非独立样本，为实际应用提供了更有效的多样化输出生成方案。

Abstract: Generative models typically sample outputs independently, and recent
inference-time guidance and scaling algorithms focus on improving the quality
of individual samples. However, in real-world applications, users are often
presented with a set of multiple images (e.g., 4-8) for each prompt, where
independent sampling tends to lead to redundant results, limiting user choices
and hindering idea exploration. In this work, we introduce a scalable group
inference method that improves both the diversity and quality of a group of
samples. We formulate group inference as a quadratic integer assignment
problem: candidate outputs are modeled as graph nodes, and a subset is selected
to optimize sample quality (unary term) while maximizing group diversity
(binary term). To substantially improve runtime efficiency, we progressively
prune the candidate set using intermediate predictions, allowing our method to
scale up to large candidate sets. Extensive experiments show that our method
significantly improves group diversity and quality compared to independent
sampling baselines and recent inference algorithms. Our framework generalizes
across a wide range of tasks, including text-to-image, image-to-image, image
prompting, and video generation, enabling generative models to treat multiple
outputs as cohesive groups rather than independent samples.

### [4] [Fast Graph Neural Network for Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14958)
*Mustafa Mohammadi Gharasuie,Luis Rueda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种将图卷积网络(GCN)与Voronoi图相结合的新方法，通过将图像表示为图结构并利用Delaunay三角剖分进行优化，显著提升了图像分类的预处理效率和分类精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统卷积神经网络在处理复杂数据结构时存在局限，而图卷积网络能够更好地建模关系数据。研究旨在通过结合GCN和Voronoi图来提升图像分类性能，特别是在复杂场景和细粒度分类任务中。

Method: 将图像表示为图结构（像素或区域作为顶点），使用对应的Delaunay三角剖分优化图表示，然后应用图卷积网络进行分类。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上实现了显著的预处理效率提升和分类准确率提高，特别是在复杂场景和细粒度分类任务中超越了现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅为图像分类提供了新的视角，还拓展了基于图的学习范式在计算机视觉和非结构化数据分析中的应用潜力。

Abstract: The rapid progress in image classification has been largely driven by the
adoption of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), which offer a robust framework
for handling complex data structures. This study introduces a novel approach
that integrates GCNs with Voronoi diagrams to enhance image classification by
leveraging their ability to effectively model relational data. Unlike
conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), our method represents images
as graphs, where pixels or regions function as vertices. These graphs are then
refined using corresponding Delaunay triangulations, optimizing their
representation. The proposed model achieves significant improvements in both
preprocessing efficiency and classification accuracy across various benchmark
datasets, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in challenging
scenarios involving intricate scenes and fine-grained categories. Experimental
results, validated through cross-validation, underscore the effectiveness of
combining GCNs with Voronoi diagrams for advancing image classification. This
research not only presents a novel perspective on image classification but also
expands the potential applications of graph-based learning paradigms in
computer vision and unstructured data analysis.

### [5] [You Only Pose Once: A Minimalist's Detection Transformer for Monocular RGB Category-level 9D Multi-Object Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14965)
*Hakjin Lee,Junghoon Seo,Jaehoon Sim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: YOPO是一个单阶段、基于查询的框架，将类别级9自由度姿态估计统一到2D检测中，仅使用RGB图像就实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖伪深度、CAD模型或多阶段级联，需要更简单的RGB-only解决方案来直接从类别级别学习9自由度姿态估计。

Method: 在transformer检测器基础上增加轻量级姿态头、边界框条件平移模块和6D感知匈牙利匹配成本，端到端训练仅使用RGB图像和类别级姿态标签。

Result: 在REAL275数据集上达到79.6% IoU50和54.1% 10°10cm指标，超越所有RGB-only方法，接近RGB-D系统性能。

Conclusion: YOPO证明了单阶段RGB-only方法能够有效统一目标检测和9自由度姿态估计，无需额外数据即可实现高性能。

Abstract: Accurately recovering the full 9-DoF pose of unseen instances within specific
categories from a single RGB image remains a core challenge for robotics and
automation. Most existing solutions still rely on pseudo-depth, CAD models, or
multi-stage cascades that separate 2D detection from pose estimation. Motivated
by the need for a simpler, RGB-only alternative that learns directly at the
category level, we revisit a longstanding question: Can object detection and
9-DoF pose estimation be unified with high performance, without any additional
data? We show that they can with our method, YOPO, a single-stage, query-based
framework that treats category-level 9-DoF estimation as a natural extension of
2D detection. YOPO augments a transformer detector with a lightweight pose
head, a bounding-box-conditioned translation module, and a 6D-aware Hungarian
matching cost. The model is trained end-to-end only with RGB images and
category-level pose labels. Despite its minimalist design, YOPO sets a new
state of the art on three benchmarks. On the REAL275 dataset, it achieves 79.6%
$\rm{IoU}_{50}$ and 54.1% under the $10^\circ$$10{\rm{cm}}$ metric, surpassing
prior RGB-only methods and closing much of the gap to RGB-D systems. The code,
models, and additional qualitative results can be found on our project.

### [6] [Paired-Sampling Contrastive Framework for Joint Physical-Digital Face Attack Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14980)
*Andrei Balykin,Anvar Ganiev,Denis Kondranin,Kirill Polevoda,Nikolai Liudkevich,Artem Petrov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Paired-Sampling Contrastive Framework统一训练框架，通过自动匹配的真实与攻击自拍对学习模态无关的活体线索，在物理-数字攻击检测基准上达到2.10%的平均分类错误率，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统人脸识别系统对物理呈现攻击和数字伪造分别使用不同模型，增加了系统复杂性和推理延迟，且无法应对组合攻击向量。需要统一的检测方法来同时处理这两种攻击类型。

Method: 使用Paired-Sampling Contrastive Framework，通过自动匹配的真实人脸和攻击自拍对进行对比学习，提取模态无关的活体特征线索。

Result: 在第六届人脸反欺骗挑战赛的统一物理-数字攻击检测基准上，平均分类错误率(ACER)达到2.10%，优于先前解决方案。框架轻量(4.46 GFLOPs)，训练时间不到一小时。

Conclusion: 该统一框架有效解决了传统分离检测方法的局限性，在保持高性能的同时实现了轻量化和快速训练，具有实际部署价值。

Abstract: Modern face recognition systems remain vulnerable to spoofing attempts,
including both physical presentation attacks and digital forgeries.
Traditionally, these two attack vectors have been handled by separate models,
each targeting its own artifacts and modalities. However, maintaining distinct
detectors increases system complexity and inference latency and leaves systems
exposed to combined attack vectors. We propose the Paired-Sampling Contrastive
Framework, a unified training approach that leverages automatically matched
pairs of genuine and attack selfies to learn modality-agnostic liveness cues.
Evaluated on the 6th Face Anti-Spoofing Challenge Unified Physical-Digital
Attack Detection benchmark, our method achieves an average classification error
rate (ACER) of 2.10 percent, outperforming prior solutions. The framework is
lightweight (4.46 GFLOPs) and trains in under one hour, making it practical for
real-world deployment. Code and pretrained models are available at
https://github.com/xPONYx/iccv2025_deepfake_challenge.

### [7] [TAIGen: Training-Free Adversarial Image Generation via Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15020)
*Susim Roy,Anubhooti Jain,Mayank Vatsa,Richa Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TAIGen是一种无需训练的黑盒对抗图像生成方法，使用3-20个采样步骤即可从无条件扩散模型生成高质量对抗样本，比现有方法快10倍


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成模型的对抗攻击往往产生低质量图像且计算资源需求大，扩散模型虽然能生成高质量图像但通常需要数百个采样步骤

Method: 通过在混合步骤区间注入扰动，结合选择性RGB通道策略：对红色通道应用注意力图，对绿色和蓝色通道使用GradCAM引导的扰动

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上，对VGGNet源模型，攻击ResNet成功率达70.6%，MNASNet达80.8%，ShuffleNet达97.8%；PSNR超过30dB，视觉质量保持良好

Conclusion: TAIGen是最具影响力的攻击方法，防御机制对其生成的图像净化效果最差，实现了最低的鲁棒准确率

Abstract: Adversarial attacks from generative models often produce low-quality images
and require substantial computational resources. Diffusion models, though
capable of high-quality generation, typically need hundreds of sampling steps
for adversarial generation. This paper introduces TAIGen, a training-free
black-box method for efficient adversarial image generation. TAIGen produces
adversarial examples using only 3-20 sampling steps from unconditional
diffusion models. Our key finding is that perturbations injected during the
mixing step interval achieve comparable attack effectiveness without processing
all timesteps. We develop a selective RGB channel strategy that applies
attention maps to the red channel while using GradCAM-guided perturbations on
green and blue channels. This design preserves image structure while maximizing
misclassification in target models. TAIGen maintains visual quality with PSNR
above 30 dB across all tested datasets. On ImageNet with VGGNet as source,
TAIGen achieves 70.6% success against ResNet, 80.8% against MNASNet, and 97.8%
against ShuffleNet. The method generates adversarial examples 10x faster than
existing diffusion-based attacks. Our method achieves the lowest robust
accuracy, indicating it is the most impactful attack as the defense mechanism
is least successful in purifying the images generated by TAIGen.

### [8] [Reversible Unfolding Network for Concealed Visual Perception with Generative Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15027)
*Chunming He,Fengyang Xiao,Rihan Zhang,Chengyu Fang,Deng-Ping Fan,Sina Farsiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RUN++是一个可逆展开网络，通过生成式细化解决隐蔽视觉感知问题，在掩码和RGB域同时应用可逆建模，并使用针对性的扩散模型细化不确定区域


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有隐蔽视觉感知方法主要局限于掩码域的可逆策略，未能充分利用RGB域的潜力，且存在不确定性处理不足的问题

Method: 将CVP任务建模为数学优化问题并展开为多阶段深度网络，包含CORE模块（掩码域可逆建模）、CARE模块（RGB域可逆建模）和FINE模块（Bernoulli扩散模型细化）

Result: 提出的方法能够有效减少误报和漏报，在真实世界退化条件下保持鲁棒性，并建立了更强大的CVP系统构建范式

Conclusion: RUN++通过可逆展开网络与生成式细化的独特协同，为隐蔽视觉感知提供了新的解决方案，实现了跨域可逆建模和高效的不确定性处理

Abstract: Existing methods for concealed visual perception (CVP) often leverage
reversible strategies to decrease uncertainty, yet these are typically confined
to the mask domain, leaving the potential of the RGB domain underexplored. To
address this, we propose a reversible unfolding network with generative
refinement, termed RUN++. Specifically, RUN++ first formulates the CVP task as
a mathematical optimization problem and unfolds the iterative solution into a
multi-stage deep network. This approach provides a principled way to apply
reversible modeling across both mask and RGB domains while leveraging a
diffusion model to resolve the resulting uncertainty. Each stage of the network
integrates three purpose-driven modules: a Concealed Object Region Extraction
(CORE) module applies reversible modeling to the mask domain to identify core
object regions; a Context-Aware Region Enhancement (CARE) module extends this
principle to the RGB domain to foster better foreground-background separation;
and a Finetuning Iteration via Noise-based Enhancement (FINE) module provides a
final refinement. The FINE module introduces a targeted Bernoulli diffusion
model that refines only the uncertain regions of the segmentation mask,
harnessing the generative power of diffusion for fine-detail restoration
without the prohibitive computational cost of a full-image process. This unique
synergy, where the unfolding network provides a strong uncertainty prior for
the diffusion model, allows RUN++ to efficiently direct its focus toward
ambiguous areas, significantly mitigating false positives and negatives.
Furthermore, we introduce a new paradigm for building robust CVP systems that
remain effective under real-world degradations and extend this concept into a
broader bi-level optimization framework.

Abstract: Livestock methane emissions represent 32% of human-caused methane production,
making automated monitoring critical for climate mitigation strategies. We
introduce GasTwinFormer, a hybrid vision transformer for real-time methane
emission segmentation and dietary classification in optical gas imaging through
a novel Mix Twin encoder alternating between spatially-reduced global attention
and locally-grouped attention mechanisms. Our architecture incorporates a
lightweight LR-ASPP decoder for multi-scale feature aggregation and enables
simultaneous methane segmentation and dietary classification in a unified
framework. We contribute the first comprehensive beef cattle methane emission
dataset using OGI, containing 11,694 annotated frames across three dietary
treatments. GasTwinFormer achieves 74.47% mIoU and 83.63% mF1 for segmentation
while maintaining exceptional efficiency with only 3.348M parameters, 3.428G
FLOPs, and 114.9 FPS inference speed. Additionally, our method achieves perfect
dietary classification accuracy (100%), demonstrating the effectiveness of
leveraging diet-emission correlations. Extensive ablation studies validate each
architectural component, establishing GasTwinFormer as a practical solution for
real-time livestock emission monitoring. Please see our project page at

### [10] [CurveFlow: Curvature-Guided Flow Matching for Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15093)
*Yan Luo,Drake Du,Hao Huang,Yi Fang,Mengyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CurveFlow是一种新颖的流匹配框架，通过引入曲率正则化来学习非线性轨迹，显著提升文本到图像生成的语义一致性和图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的整流流模型基于数据与噪声分布之间的线性轨迹，这种线性性强制零曲率，可能导致图像生成过程被迫通过数据流形的低概率区域，影响生成图像与文本描述的语义对齐。

Method: 提出CurveFlow框架，直接在流路径中融入曲率指导，采用鲁棒的曲率正则化技术惩罚轨迹内在动力学的突变，学习平滑的非线性轨迹。

Result: 在MS COCO 2014和2017数据集上的实验表明，CurveFlow在文本到图像生成任务中达到最先进性能，在BLEU、METEOR、ROUGE和CLAIR等语义一致性指标上显著优于标准整流流变体和其他非线性基线。

Conclusion: 曲率感知建模显著增强了模型忠实遵循复杂指令的能力，同时保持高质量的图像生成效果，证明了非线性轨迹在提升语义对齐方面的重要性。

Abstract: Existing rectified flow models are based on linear trajectories between data
and noise distributions. This linearity enforces zero curvature, which can
inadvertently force the image generation process through low-probability
regions of the data manifold. A key question remains underexplored: how does
the curvature of these trajectories correlate with the semantic alignment
between generated images and their corresponding captions, i.e., instructional
compliance? To address this, we introduce CurveFlow, a novel flow matching
framework designed to learn smooth, non-linear trajectories by directly
incorporating curvature guidance into the flow path. Our method features a
robust curvature regularization technique that penalizes abrupt changes in the
trajectory's intrinsic dynamics.Extensive experiments on MS COCO 2014 and 2017
demonstrate that CurveFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance in
text-to-image generation, significantly outperforming both standard rectified
flow variants and other non-linear baselines like Rectified Diffusion. The
improvements are especially evident in semantic consistency metrics such as
BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, and CLAIR. This confirms that our curvature-aware modeling
substantially enhances the model's ability to faithfully follow complex
instructions while simultaneously maintaining high image quality. The code is
made publicly available at
https://github.com/Harvard-AI-and-Robotics-Lab/CurveFlow.

### [11] [HiRQA: Hierarchical Ranking and Quality Alignment for Opinion-Unaware Image Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15130)
*Vaishnav Ramesh,Haining Wang,Md Jahidul Islam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiRQA是一个自监督的无参考图像质量评估框架，通过分层排序和对齐学习实现质量感知嵌入，无需参考图像或主观标签，在合成和真实失真上都表现出优异的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的无参考图像质量评估方法存在数据集偏差和依赖主观标签的问题，限制了其泛化能力。需要开发不依赖原始参考图像或辅助模态的自监督方法。

Method: 提出HiRQA框架，结合排序学习和对比学习：1）高阶排序损失监督质量预测的关系排序；2）嵌入距离损失确保特征距离与感知差异一致；3）基于结构化文本提示的对比对齐损失增强表示学习。

Result: 仅在合成失真上训练的HiRQA能有效泛化到真实退化（如镜头光晕、雾霾、运动模糊、低光条件）。轻量版HiRQA-S推理时间仅3.5ms/图像，在合成和真实基准测试中达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: HiRQA通过自监督的层次化排序和对齐学习，实现了优异的无参考图像质量评估性能，具有强大的泛化能力和实时部署可行性，为IQA领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in no-reference image quality assessment
(NR-IQA), dataset biases and reliance on subjective labels continue to hinder
their generalization performance. We propose HiRQA, Hierarchical Ranking and
Quality Alignment), a self-supervised, opinion-unaware framework that offers a
hierarchical, quality-aware embedding through a combination of ranking and
contrastive learning. Unlike prior approaches that depend on pristine
references or auxiliary modalities at inference time, HiRQA predicts quality
scores using only the input image. We introduce a novel higher-order ranking
loss that supervises quality predictions through relational ordering across
distortion pairs, along with an embedding distance loss that enforces
consistency between feature distances and perceptual differences. A
training-time contrastive alignment loss, guided by structured textual prompts,
further enhances the learned representation. Trained only on synthetic
distortions, HiRQA generalizes effectively to authentic degradations, as
demonstrated through evaluation on various distortions such as lens flare,
haze, motion blur, and low-light conditions. For real-time deployment, we
introduce \textbf{HiRQA-S}, a lightweight variant with an inference time of
only 3.5 ms per image. Extensive experiments across synthetic and authentic
benchmarks validate HiRQA's state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, strong
generalization ability, and scalability.

### [12] [Reliable Multi-view 3D Reconstruction for `Just-in-time' Edge Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15158)
*Md. Nurul Absur,Abhinav Kumar,Swastik Brahma,Saptarshi Debroy*

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多视角3D重建在应急响应等关键应用中需要近实时处理，但边缘环境的动态性和操作挑战会导致相机操作中断，影响重建质量。

Result: 在公开和定制3D数据集上的实验表明，该方法相比传统基线策略能更好地保证3D重建的可靠性。

Conclusion: 所提出的相机选择策略能有效应对边缘环境中的时空中断，确保多视角3D重建的质量和可靠性。

Abstract: Multi-view 3D reconstruction applications are revolutionizing critical use
cases that require rapid situational-awareness, such as emergency response,
tactical scenarios, and public safety. In many cases, their near-real-time
latency requirements and ad-hoc needs for compute resources necessitate
adoption of `Just-in-time' edge environments where the system is set up on the
fly to support the applications during the mission lifetime. However,
reliability issues can arise from the inherent dynamism and operational
adversities of such edge environments, resulting in spatiotemporally correlated
disruptions that impact the camera operations, which can lead to sustained
degradation of reconstruction quality. In this paper, we propose a novel
portfolio theory inspired edge resource management strategy for reliable
multi-view 3D reconstruction against possible system disruptions. Our proposed
methodology can guarantee reconstruction quality satisfaction even when the
cameras are prone to spatiotemporally correlated disruptions. The portfolio
theoretic optimization problem is solved using a genetic algorithm that
converges quickly for realistic system settings. Using publicly available and
customized 3D datasets, we demonstrate the proposed camera selection strategy's
benefits in guaranteeing reliable 3D reconstruction against traditional
baseline strategies, under spatiotemporal disruptions.

### [13] [XDR-LVLM: An Explainable Vision-Language Large Model for Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15168)
*Masato Ito,Kaito Tanaka,Keisuke Matsuda,Aya Nakayama*

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习模型在糖尿病视网膜病变诊断中的黑盒问题，缺乏透明度和可解释性阻碍了临床应用。

Method: 集成专用医学视觉编码器和LVLM核心，采用多任务提示工程和多阶段微调，从眼底图像理解病理特征并生成诊断报告。

Conclusion: XDR-LVLM通过提供稳健且可解释的洞察，成功弥合了自动化诊断与临床需求之间的差距。

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of global blindness, necessitating
early and accurate diagnosis. While deep learning models have shown promise in
DR detection, their black-box nature often hinders clinical adoption due to a
lack of transparency and interpretability. To address this, we propose XDR-LVLM
(eXplainable Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis with LVLM), a novel framework that
leverages Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) for high-precision DR diagnosis
coupled with natural language-based explanations. XDR-LVLM integrates a
specialized Medical Vision Encoder, an LVLM Core, and employs Multi-task Prompt
Engineering and Multi-stage Fine-tuning to deeply understand pathological
features within fundus images and generate comprehensive diagnostic reports.
These reports explicitly include DR severity grading, identification of key
pathological concepts (e.g., hemorrhages, exudates, microaneurysms), and
detailed explanations linking observed features to the diagnosis. Extensive
experiments on the Diabetic Retinopathy (DDR) dataset demonstrate that XDR-LVLM

Motivation: 城市网格模型缺乏逼真纹理限制了其在虚拟城市导航和自动驾驶中的应用，现有图像和视频扩散模型在3D场景生成方面存在几何对齐和视图一致性的挑战。

Method: 采用三阶段流水线：1) 使用级联外绘ControlNet生成几何一致的稀疏视图；2) 通过AGInpaint组件传播更密集的中间视图；3) 使用GCAlign模块全局消除视觉不一致性。同时基于网格表面初始化3D高斯溅射进行场景重建。

Result: 在几何对齐和生成质量方面优于现有方法，能够渲染出多样风格的场景。

Conclusion: MeSS方法成功解决了城市网格模型纹理生成问题，为虚拟城市导航和自动驾驶提供了高质量的3D场景合成解决方案。

Abstract: Mesh models have become increasingly accessible for numerous cities; however,
the lack of realistic textures restricts their application in virtual urban
navigation and autonomous driving. To address this, this paper proposes MeSS
(Meshbased Scene Synthesis) for generating high-quality, styleconsistent
outdoor scenes with city mesh models serving as the geometric prior. While
image and video diffusion models can leverage spatial layouts (such as depth
maps or HD maps) as control conditions to generate street-level perspective
views, they are not directly applicable to 3D scene generation. Video diffusion
models excel at synthesizing consistent view sequences that depict scenes but
often struggle to adhere to predefined camera paths or align accurately with
rendered control videos. In contrast, image diffusion models, though unable to
guarantee cross-view visual consistency, can produce more geometry-aligned
results when combined with ControlNet. Building on this insight, our approach
enhances image diffusion models by improving cross-view consistency. The
pipeline comprises three key stages: first, we generate geometrically
consistent sparse views using Cascaded Outpainting ControlNets; second, we
propagate denser intermediate views via a component dubbed AGInpaint; and
third, we globally eliminate visual inconsistencies (e.g., varying exposure)
using the GCAlign module. Concurrently with generation, a 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) scene is reconstructed by initializing Gaussian balls on the mesh
surface. Our method outperforms existing approaches in both geometric alignment
and generation quality. Once synthesized, the scene can be rendered in diverse
styles through relighting and style transfer techniques.

TL;DR: 提出了首个开源手术伤口数据集SurgWound和诊断基准，并开发了三阶段学习框架WoundQwen，用于手术伤口特征分析、感染风险评估和个性化报告生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手术部位感染(SSI)是常见且昂贵的医疗相关感染，现有深度学习研究受限于数据隐私和专家标注成本，缺乏公开数据集和开源筛查工具。

Method: 1) 创建包含697张手术伤口图像的SurgWound数据集，由3名专业外科医生标注8个细粒度临床属性；2) 建立包含视觉问答和报告生成任务的基准；3) 提出三阶段框架WoundQwen：第一阶段用5个MLLM预测伤口特征，第二阶段用2个MLLM进行感染风险评估，第三阶段整合结果生成综合报告。

Result: 开发了首个开源手术伤口数据集和诊断基准，提出了能够分析详细伤口特征、评估感染风险并提供个性化护理指导的三阶段框架。

Conclusion: 该研究为个性化伤口护理、及时干预和改善患者预后铺平了道路，解决了手术伤口筛查中的数据隐私和标注成本问题。

Abstract: Surgical site infection (SSI) is one of the most common and costly
healthcare-associated infections and and surgical wound care remains a
significant clinical challenge in preventing SSIs and improving patient
outcomes. While recent studies have explored the use of deep learning for
preliminary surgical wound screening, progress has been hindered by concerns
over data privacy and the high costs associated with expert annotation.
Currently, no publicly available dataset or benchmark encompasses various types
of surgical wounds, resulting in the absence of an open-source Surgical-Wound
screening tool. To address this gap: (1) we present SurgWound, the first
open-source dataset featuring a diverse array of surgical wound types. It
contains 697 surgical wound images annotated by 3 professional surgeons with
eight fine-grained clinical attributes. (2) Based on SurgWound, we introduce
the first benchmark for surgical wound diagnosis, which includes visual
question answering (VQA) and report generation tasks to comprehensively
evaluate model performance. (3) Furthermore, we propose a three-stage learning
framework, WoundQwen, for surgical wound diagnosis. In the first stage, we
employ five independent MLLMs to accurately predict specific surgical wound
characteristics. In the second stage, these predictions serve as additional
knowledge inputs to two MLLMs responsible for diagnosing outcomes, which assess
infection risk and guide subsequent interventions. In the third stage, we train
a MLLM that integrates the diagnostic results from the previous two stages to
produce a comprehensive report. This three-stage framework can analyze detailed
surgical wound characteristics and provide subsequent instructions to patients
based on surgical images, paving the way for personalized wound care, timely
intervention, and improved patient outcomes.

Abstract: Accurate morphological quantification of renal pathology functional units
relies on instance-level segmentation, yet most existing datasets and automated
methods provide only binary (semantic) masks, limiting the precision of
downstream analyses. Although classical post-processing techniques such as
watershed, morphological operations, and skeletonization, are often used to
separate semantic masks into instances, their individual effectiveness is
constrained by the diverse morphologies and complex connectivity found in renal
tissue. In this study, we present DyMorph-B2I, a dynamic, morphology-guided
binary-to-instance segmentation pipeline tailored for renal pathology. Our
approach integrates watershed, skeletonization, and morphological operations
within a unified framework, complemented by adaptive geometric refinement and
customizable hyperparameter tuning for each class of functional unit. Through
systematic parameter optimization, DyMorph-B2I robustly separates adherent and
heterogeneous structures present in binary masks. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms individual classical approaches and
na\"ive combinations, enabling superior instance separation and facilitating
more accurate morphometric analysis in renal pathology workflows. The pipeline

Motivation: 现有ADAS系统依赖多种传感器成本较高，仅使用行车记录仪视频是更具成本效益和易部署的解决方案，但预测准确性面临挑战。

Method: 结合改进的时空特征提取，通过循环网络进行特征聚合，基于图神经网络构建STAGNet模型进行事故预测。

Conclusion: STAGNet模型有效提升了仅使用行车记录仪视频进行事故预测的性能，为低成本ADAS系统提供了可行的技术方案。

Abstract: Accident prediction and timely warnings play a key role in improving road
safety by reducing the risk of injury to road users and minimizing property
damage. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are designed to support human
drivers and are especially useful when they can anticipate potential accidents
before they happen. While many existing systems depend on a range of sensors
such as LiDAR, radar, and GPS, relying solely on dash-cam video input presents
a more challenging but a more cost-effective and easily deployable solution. In
this work, we incorporate better spatio-temporal features and aggregate them
through a recurrent network to improve upon state-of-the-art graph neural
networks for predicting accidents from dash-cam videos. Experiments using three
publicly available datasets show that our proposed STAGNet model achieves
higher average precision and mean time-to-collision values than previous
methods, both when cross-validated on a given dataset and when trained and
tested on different datasets.

TL;DR: TriMM是首个基于多模态数据（RGB、RGBD、点云）的前馈式3D原生生成模型，通过协作多模态编码和三平面潜在扩散模型，有效利用不同模态的优势生成高质量3D资产。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D生成模型大多局限于单一模态或3D结构，无法充分利用多模态数据的互补优势，限制了训练数据集的范围和生成质量。

Method: 1）引入协作多模态编码整合模态特定特征；2）采用辅助2D和3D监督提升鲁棒性；3）使用三平面潜在扩散模型生成高质量3D资产

Result: 在多个知名数据集上的实验表明，TriMM仅使用少量训练数据就能达到与大规模数据集训练模型相竞争的性能，并在RGB-D数据集上验证了多模态数据集整合的可行性

Conclusion: TriMM通过有效利用多模态数据，在3D生成任务中实现了优异的性能，证明了多模态方法在3D内容生成中的巨大潜力

Abstract: 3D content inherently encompasses multi-modal characteristics and can be
projected into different modalities (e.g., RGB images, RGBD, and point clouds).
Each modality exhibits distinct advantages in 3D asset modeling: RGB images
contain vivid 3D textures, whereas point clouds define fine-grained 3D
geometries. However, most existing 3D-native generative architectures either
operate predominantly within single-modality paradigms-thus overlooking the
complementary benefits of multi-modality data-or restrict themselves to 3D
structures, thereby limiting the scope of available training datasets. To
holistically harness multi-modalities for 3D modeling, we present TriMM, the
first feed-forward 3D-native generative model that learns from basic
multi-modalities (e.g., RGB, RGBD, and point cloud). Specifically, 1) TriMM
first introduces collaborative multi-modal coding, which integrates
modality-specific features while preserving their unique representational
strengths. 2) Furthermore, auxiliary 2D and 3D supervision are introduced to
raise the robustness and performance of multi-modal coding. 3) Based on the
embedded multi-modal code, TriMM employs a triplane latent diffusion model to
generate 3D assets of superior quality, enhancing both the texture and the
geometric detail. Extensive experiments on multiple well-known datasets
demonstrate that TriMM, by effectively leveraging multi-modality, achieves
competitive performance with models trained on large-scale datasets, despite
utilizing a small amount of training data. Furthermore, we conduct additional
experiments on recent RGB-D datasets, verifying the feasibility of
incorporating other multi-modal datasets into 3D generation.

TL;DR: 提出一种面向中心的原型对比聚类框架，通过软原型对比模块和双重一致性学习模块解决类间冲突和原型漂移问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对比学习方法在聚类任务中存在类间冲突问题，硬原型计算与真实聚类中心存在偏差

Method: 使用软原型对比模块（以样本属于聚类中心的概率作为权重计算原型）和双重一致性学习模块（对齐相同样本的不同变换和不同样本的邻域）

Result: 在五个数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法相比最先进方法具有有效性

Conclusion: 该方法能有效避免类间冲突、减少原型漂移，并提供可靠的原型计算保证

Abstract: Contrastive learning is widely used in clustering tasks due to its
discriminative representation. However, the conflict problem between classes is
difficult to solve effectively. Existing methods try to solve this problem
through prototype contrast, but there is a deviation between the calculation of
hard prototypes and the true cluster center. To address this problem, we
propose a center-oriented prototype contrastive clustering framework, which
consists of a soft prototype contrastive module and a dual consistency learning
module. In short, the soft prototype contrastive module uses the probability
that the sample belongs to the cluster center as a weight to calculate the
prototype of each category, while avoiding inter-class conflicts and reducing
prototype drift. The dual consistency learning module aligns different
transformations of the same sample and the neighborhoods of different samples
respectively, ensuring that the features have transformation-invariant semantic
information and compact intra-cluster distribution, while providing reliable
guarantees for the calculation of prototypes. Extensive experiments on five
datasets show that the proposed method is effective compared to the SOTA. Our
code is published on https://github.com/LouisDong95/CPCC.

Conclusion: 双高度无人机协作VLN模式能够有效解决单机导航的挑战，通过高空机的广视角环境推理能力和低空机的精确导航能力相结合，实现更高效、更稳健的自主导航性能

Abstract: Aerial Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is an emerging task that enables
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to navigate outdoor environments using natural
language instructions and visual cues. However, due to the extended
trajectories and complex maneuverability of UAVs, achieving reliable UAV-VLN
performance is challenging and often requires human intervention or overly
detailed instructions. To harness the advantages of UAVs' high mobility, which
could provide multi-grained perspectives, while maintaining a manageable motion
space for learning, we introduce a novel task called Dual-Altitude UAV
Collaborative VLN (DuAl-VLN). In this task, two UAVs operate at distinct
altitudes: a high-altitude UAV responsible for broad environmental reasoning,
and a low-altitude UAV tasked with precise navigation. To support the training
and evaluation of the DuAl-VLN, we construct the HaL-13k, a dataset comprising
13,838 collaborative high-low UAV demonstration trajectories, each paired with
target-oriented language instructions. This dataset includes both unseen maps
and an unseen object validation set to systematically evaluate the model's
generalization capabilities across novel environments and unfamiliar targets.
To consolidate their complementary strengths, we propose a dual-UAV
collaborative VLN framework, AeroDuo, where the high-altitude UAV integrates a
multimodal large language model (Pilot-LLM) for target reasoning, while the
low-altitude UAV employs a lightweight multi-stage policy for navigation and
target grounding. The two UAVs work collaboratively and only exchange minimal
coordinate information to ensure efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种跳过步采样机制，可以直接绕过多个中间去噪步骤，实现扩散模型的加速采样，且该方法与标准扩散模型具有相同的训练目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽然在各生成任务中达到SOTA效果，但其顺序生成过程需要多步迭代，采样效率低。现有方法如DDIM通过非马尔可夫过程减少采样步数，但缺乏对原始扩散过程能否以马尔可夫方式实现相同效率的理解。

Method: 提出了跳过步采样机制，允许在迭代生成过程中直接跳过多个中间去噪步骤，而不是传统的逐步细化。该方法从与标准扩散模型相同的训练目标推导而来，证明了通过马尔可夫方式加速采样是预训练扩散模型的内在特性。

Result: 在OpenAI ADM、Stable Diffusion和Open Sora等流行预训练扩散模型上的大量实验表明，该方法能够以显著减少的采样步数实现高质量生成。

Conclusion: 跳过步采样是一种有效的扩散模型加速采样方法，它揭示了预训练扩散模型本身具有通过马尔可夫过程实现高效采样的内在能力，并且可以与DDIM等现有方法结合进一步提升生成效果。

Abstract: Diffusion models have been achieving state-of-the-art results across various
generation tasks. However, a notable drawback is their sequential generation
process, requiring long-sequence step-by-step generation. Existing methods,
such as DDIM, attempt to reduce sampling steps by constructing a class of
non-Markovian diffusion processes that maintain the same training objective.
However, there remains a gap in understanding whether the original diffusion
process can achieve the same efficiency without resorting to non-Markovian
processes. In this paper, we provide a confirmative answer and introduce
skipped-step sampling, a mechanism that bypasses multiple intermediate
denoising steps in the iterative generation process, in contrast with the
traditional step-by-step refinement of standard diffusion inference. Crucially,
we demonstrate that this skipped-step sampling mechanism is derived from the
same training objective as the standard diffusion model, indicating that
accelerated sampling via skipped-step sampling via a Markovian way is an
intrinsic property of pretrained diffusion models. Additionally, we propose an
enhanced generation method by integrating our accelerated sampling technique
with DDIM. Extensive experiments on popular pretrained diffusion models,
including the OpenAI ADM, Stable Diffusion, and Open Sora models, show that our
method achieves high-quality generation with significantly reduced sampling
steps.

Abstract: We present Comp-X, the first intelligently interactive image compression
paradigm empowered by the impressive reasoning capability of large language
model (LLM) agent. Notably, commonly used image codecs usually suffer from
limited coding modes and rely on manual mode selection by engineers, making
them unfriendly for unprofessional users. To overcome this, we advance the
evolution of image coding paradigm by introducing three key innovations: (i)
multi-functional coding framework, which unifies different coding modes of
various objective/requirements, including human-machine perception, variable
coding, and spatial bit allocation, into one framework. (ii) interactive coding
agent, where we propose an augmented in-context learning method with coding
expert feedback to teach the LLM agent how to understand the coding request,
mode selection, and the use of the coding tools. (iii) IIC-bench, the first
dedicated benchmark comprising diverse user requests and the corresponding
annotations from coding experts, which is systematically designed for
intelligently interactive image compression evaluation. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed Comp-X can understand the coding requests
efficiently and achieve impressive textual interaction capability. Meanwhile,
it can maintain comparable compression performance even with a single coding
framework, providing a promising avenue for artificial general intelligence
(AGI) in image compression.

Motivation: 现有车道拓扑推理方法采用先检测后推理的范式，基于一对一分配结果进行监督，导致监督范围有限，拓扑推理性能次优。

Method: 重构Transformer解码器，交换交叉注意力和自注意力层顺序，保留冗余车道预测；实例化多个并行交叉注意力块以增强车道检测多样性。

Result: 在OpenLane-V2数据集上的实验表明，RATopo策略具有模型无关性，可无缝集成到现有拓扑推理框架中，持续提升车道-车道和车道-交通拓扑性能。

Conclusion: RATopo通过冗余分配策略实现了数量丰富和几何多样的拓扑监督，有效解决了现有方法监督范围有限的问题，显著提升了车道拓扑推理性能。

Abstract: Lane topology reasoning plays a critical role in autonomous driving by
modeling the connections among lanes and the topological relationships between
lanes and traffic elements. Most existing methods adopt a
first-detect-then-reason paradigm, where topological relationships are
supervised based on the one-to-one assignment results obtained during the
detection stage. This supervision strategy results in suboptimal topology
reasoning performance due to the limited range of valid supervision. In this
paper, we propose RATopo, a Redundancy Assignment strategy for lane Topology
reasoning that enables quantity-rich and geometry-diverse topology supervision.
Specifically, we restructure the Transformer decoder by swapping the
cross-attention and self-attention layers. This allows redundant lane
predictions to be retained before suppression, enabling effective one-to-many
assignment. We also instantiate multiple parallel cross-attention blocks with
independent parameters, which further enhances the diversity of detected lanes.
Extensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 demonstrate that our RATopo strategy is
model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing topology
reasoning frameworks, consistently improving both lane-lane and lane-traffic
topology performance.

Abstract: In the field of design patent analysis, traditional tasks such as patent
classification and patent image retrieval heavily depend on the image data.
However, patent images -- typically consisting of sketches with abstract and
structural elements of an invention -- often fall short in conveying
comprehensive visual context and semantic information. This inadequacy can lead
to ambiguities in evaluation during prior art searches. Recent advancements in
vision-language models, such as CLIP, offer promising opportunities for more
reliable and accurate AI-driven patent analysis. In this work, we leverage CLIP
models to develop a unified framework DesignCLIP for design patent applications
with a large-scale dataset of U.S. design patents. To address the unique
characteristics of patent data, DesignCLIP incorporates class-aware
classification and contrastive learning, utilizing generated detailed captions
for patent images and multi-views image learning. We validate the effectiveness
of DesignCLIP across various downstream tasks, including patent classification
and patent retrieval. Additionally, we explore multimodal patent retrieval,
which provides the potential to enhance creativity and innovation in design by
offering more diverse sources of inspiration. Our experiments show that
DesignCLIP consistently outperforms baseline and SOTA models in the patent
domain on all tasks. Our findings underscore the promise of multimodal
approaches in advancing patent analysis. The codebase is available here:

TL;DR: TPA是一种用于胎儿先天性心脏病超声视频分类的框架，结合时序建模、提示感知对比学习和不确定性量化，在CHD检测和心功能评估任务上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决超声视频中先天性心脏病检测面临的图像噪声、探头位置变异性问题，现有方法忽视时序信息、仅限于二分类且缺乏预测校准。

Method: 提出时序提示对齐(TPA)方法，利用基础图像-文本模型和提示感知对比学习，通过图像编码器提取帧特征，可训练时序提取器聚合特征捕捉心脏运动，并使用边际铰链对比损失对齐视频表示与类别特定文本提示。引入条件变分自编码器风格调制(CVAESM)模块学习潜在风格向量来调节嵌入并量化分类不确定性。

Result: 在CHD检测上获得85.40%的宏F1分数，预期校准误差降低5.38%，自适应ECE降低6.8%。在EchoNet-Dynamic三分类任务上，宏F1提升4.73%(从53.89%到58.62%)。

Conclusion: TPA框架通过整合时序建模、提示感知对比学习和不确定性量化，在胎儿先天性心脏病超声视频分类中实现了优异的性能和临床可靠性。

Abstract: Congenital heart defect (CHD) detection in ultrasound videos is hindered by
image noise and probe positioning variability. While automated methods can
reduce operator dependence, current machine learning approaches often neglect
temporal information, limit themselves to binary classification, and do not
account for prediction calibration. We propose Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA),
a method leveraging foundation image-text model and prompt-aware contrastive
learning to classify fetal CHD on cardiac ultrasound videos. TPA extracts
features from each frame of video subclips using an image encoder, aggregates
them with a trainable temporal extractor to capture heart motion, and aligns
the video representation with class-specific text prompts via a margin-hinge
contrastive loss. To enhance calibration for clinical reliability, we introduce
a Conditional Variational Autoencoder Style Modulation (CVAESM) module, which
learns a latent style vector to modulate embeddings and quantifies
classification uncertainty. Evaluated on a private dataset for CHD detection
and on a large public dataset, EchoNet-Dynamic, for systolic dysfunction, TPA
achieves state-of-the-art macro F1 scores of 85.40% for CHD diagnosis, while
also reducing expected calibration error by 5.38% and adaptive ECE by 6.8%. On
EchoNet-Dynamic's three-class task, it boosts macro F1 by 4.73% (from 53.89% to
58.62%). Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA) is a framework for fetal congenital
heart defect (CHD) classification in ultrasound videos that integrates temporal
modeling, prompt-aware contrastive learning, and uncertainty quantification.

TL;DR: BasketLiDAR是首个结合LiDAR点云和多视角摄像头的篮球运动多模态数据集，提出了基于LiDAR的实时3D多目标跟踪框架，解决了传统摄像头方法在遮挡条件下的性能瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多摄像头系统受限于2D视频数据和复杂3D重建处理，难以实现实时分析。篮球运动中球员快速移动和频繁遮挡使得多目标跟踪特别困难。

Method: 构建BasketLiDAR多模态数据集（包含4,445帧和3,105个球员ID），开发基于LiDAR的实时跟踪流水线和LiDAR-摄像头融合的多模态跟踪流水线，利用LiDAR的高精度3D空间信息。

Conclusion: LiDAR与摄像头的多模态融合为体育MOT领域提供了新的解决方案，BasketLiDAR数据集和提出的框架在实时性和跟踪精度方面都有显著提升。

Abstract: Real-time 3D trajectory player tracking in sports plays a crucial role in
tactical analysis, performance evaluation, and enhancing spectator experience.
Traditional systems rely on multi-camera setups, but are constrained by the
inherently two-dimensional nature of video data and the need for complex 3D
reconstruction processing, making real-time analysis challenging. Basketball,
in particular, represents one of the most difficult scenarios in the MOT field,
as ten players move rapidly and complexly within a confined court space, with
frequent occlusions caused by intense physical contact.
  To address these challenges, this paper constructs BasketLiDAR, the first
multimodal dataset in the sports MOT field that combines LiDAR point clouds
with synchronized multi-view camera footage in a professional basketball
environment, and proposes a novel MOT framework that simultaneously achieves
improved tracking accuracy and reduced computational cost. The BasketLiDAR
dataset contains a total of 4,445 frames and 3,105 player IDs, with fully
synchronized IDs between three LiDAR sensors and three multi-view cameras. We
recorded 5-on-5 and 3-on-3 game data from actual professional basketball
players, providing complete 3D positional information and ID annotations for
each player. Based on this dataset, we developed a novel MOT algorithm that
leverages LiDAR's high-precision 3D spatial information. The proposed method
consists of a real-time tracking pipeline using LiDAR alone and a multimodal
tracking pipeline that fuses LiDAR and camera data. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach achieves real-time operation, which was difficult
with conventional camera-only methods, while achieving superior tracking
performance even under occlusion conditions. The dataset is available upon

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决伪装目标检测中现有方法需要大量训练和计算资源的问题，以及基础模型需要高质量提示但手动生成成本高的问题

Method: 两阶段方法：第一阶段通过无监督聚类构建检索数据库进行特征检索生成粗掩码提示；第二阶段使用SAM2进行精细分割

Result: 在基准COD数据集上达到或超越最先进方法的性能，所有实验在个人笔记本上完成，计算效率高

Conclusion: RAG-SEG提供了一种无需训练的高效伪装目标检测范式，具有很好的实用性和计算效率

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection (COD) poses a significant challenge in computer
vision due to the high similarity between objects and their backgrounds.
Existing approaches often rely on heavy training and large computational
resources. While foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
offer strong generalization, they still struggle to handle COD tasks without
fine-tuning and require high-quality prompts to yield good performance.
However, generating such prompts manually is costly and inefficient. To address
these challenges, we propose \textbf{First RAG, Second SEG (RAG-SEG)}, a
training-free paradigm that decouples COD into two stages: Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) for generating coarse masks as prompts, followed by SAM-based
segmentation (SEG) for refinement. RAG-SEG constructs a compact retrieval
database via unsupervised clustering, enabling fast and effective feature
retrieval. During inference, the retrieved features produce pseudo-labels that
guide precise mask generation using SAM2. Our method eliminates the need for
conventional training while maintaining competitive performance. Extensive
experiments on benchmark COD datasets demonstrate that RAG-SEG performs on par
with or surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Notably, all experiments are
conducted on a \textbf{personal laptop}, highlighting the computational
efficiency and practicality of our approach. We present further analysis in the
Appendix, covering limitations, salient object detection extension, and
possible improvements.

TL;DR: VideoEraser是一个无需训练的即插即用框架，通过两阶段处理防止文本到视频扩散模型生成包含不良概念的内容，在四个任务中平均减少46%的不良内容生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到视频扩散模型的快速发展引发了隐私、版权和安全问题，这些模型可能被滥用来生成有害或误导性内容，因为它们通常在包含未经授权的个人身份、艺术创作和有害材料的数据集上训练。

Method: VideoEraser采用两阶段过程：选择性提示嵌入调整（SPEA）和抗干扰噪声引导（ARNG），作为即插即用模块无缝集成到文本到视频扩散模型中。

Result: 在对象擦除、艺术风格擦除、名人擦除和显式内容擦除四个任务中，VideoEraser在效能、完整性、保真度、鲁棒性和泛化性方面始终优于现有方法，平均减少46%的不良内容生成。

Conclusion: VideoEraser在抑制文本到视频生成过程中的不良内容方面达到了最先进的性能，为解决扩散模型的滥用问题提供了有效的训练免费解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid growth of text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models has raised concerns
about privacy, copyright, and safety due to their potential misuse in
generating harmful or misleading content. These models are often trained on
numerous datasets, including unauthorized personal identities, artistic
creations, and harmful materials, which can lead to uncontrolled production and
distribution of such content. To address this, we propose VideoEraser, a
training-free framework that prevents T2V diffusion models from generating
videos with undesirable concepts, even when explicitly prompted with those
concepts. Designed as a plug-and-play module, VideoEraser can seamlessly
integrate with representative T2V diffusion models via a two-stage process:
Selective Prompt Embedding Adjustment (SPEA) and Adversarial-Resilient Noise
Guidance (ARNG). We conduct extensive evaluations across four tasks, including
object erasure, artistic style erasure, celebrity erasure, and explicit content
erasure. Experimental results show that VideoEraser consistently outperforms
prior methods regarding efficacy, integrity, fidelity, robustness, and
generalizability. Notably, VideoEraser achieves state-of-the-art performance in
suppressing undesirable content during T2V generation, reducing it by 46% on
average across four tasks compared to baselines.

Abstract: The world is constantly moving towards AI based systems and autonomous
vehicles are now reality in different parts of the world. These vehicles
require sensors and cameras to detect objects and maneuver according to that.
It becomes important to for such vehicles to also predict from a distant if a
person is about to cross a road or not. The current study focused on predicting
the intent of crossing the road by pedestrians in an experimental setup. The
study involved working with deep learning models to predict poses and sequence
modelling for temporal predictions. The study analysed three different sequence
modelling to understand the prediction behaviour and it was found out that GRU
was better in predicting the intent compared to LSTM model but 1D CNN was the
best model in terms of speed. The study involved video analysis, and the output
of pose detection model was integrated later on to sequence modelling
techniques for an end-to-end deep learning framework for predicting road
crossing intents.

Motivation: 现有Video-LLM研究主要关注性能提升，对其内部机制理解有限，本文旨在通过系统实证研究填补这一空白。

Method: 采用注意力敲除作为主要分析工具，设计了三种敲除变体（时间、空间、语言到视频），并在不同层数窗口上应用，设置了全局和细粒度两种分析设置。

Result: 发现视频信息提取主要在早期层完成（两阶段处理），某些中间层对视频问答有超大影响，时空建模更依赖语言引导检索。基于这些发现可以减少注意力计算。

Conclusion: 这是首个系统揭示Video-LLM内部视频处理机制的工作，为未来研究提供了可解释性和效率提升的视角。

Abstract: Taking advantage of large-scale data and pretrained language models, Video
Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in answering
video questions. However, most existing efforts focus on improving performance,
with limited attention to understanding their internal mechanisms. This paper
aims to bridge this gap through a systematic empirical study. To interpret
existing VideoLLMs, we adopt attention knockouts as our primary analytical tool
and design three variants: Video Temporal Knockout, Video Spatial Knockout, and
Language-to-Video Knockout. Then, we apply these three knockouts on different
numbers of layers (window of layers). By carefully controlling the window of
layers and types of knockouts, we provide two settings: a global setting and a
fine-grained setting. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) Global setting
indicates Video information extraction primarily occurs in early layers,
forming a clear two-stage process -- lower layers focus on perceptual encoding,
while higher layers handle abstract reasoning; (2) In the fine-grained setting,
certain intermediate layers exert an outsized impact on video question
answering, acting as critical outliers, whereas most other layers contribute
minimally; (3) In both settings, we observe that spatial-temporal modeling
relies more on language-guided retrieval than on intra- and inter-frame
self-attention among video tokens, despite the latter's high computational
cost. Finally, we demonstrate that these insights can be leveraged to reduce
attention computation in Video-LLMs. To our knowledge, this is the first work
to systematically uncover how Video-LLMs internally process and understand
video content, offering interpretability and efficiency perspectives for future
research.

Motivation: 传统微调方法需要更新所有模型参数，可能导致过拟合和计算成本高，需要更高效的迁移学习策略。

Method: 使用进化算法识别需要微调的层子集，专注于相关层进行参数更新，减少可训练参数数量。

Result: 在9个不同领域的图像分类数据集上评估，相比AutoRGN和LoRA等方法，BioTune实现了竞争性或更好的准确性和效率。

Conclusion: 通过选择性层微调，BioTune降低了计算成本，促进了跨不同数据特征和分布的更高效迁移学习。

Abstract: Deep learning has shown substantial progress in image analysis. However, the
computational demands of large, fully trained models remain a consideration.
Transfer learning offers a strategy for adapting pre-trained models to new
tasks. Traditional fine-tuning often involves updating all model parameters,
which can potentially lead to overfitting and higher computational costs. This
paper introduces BioTune, an evolutionary adaptive fine-tuning technique that
selectively fine-tunes layers to enhance transfer learning efficiency. BioTune
employs an evolutionary algorithm to identify a focused set of layers for
fine-tuning, aiming to optimize model performance on a given target task.
Evaluation across nine image classification datasets from various domains
indicates that BioTune achieves competitive or improved accuracy and efficiency
compared to existing fine-tuning methods such as AutoRGN and LoRA. By
concentrating the fine-tuning process on a subset of relevant layers, BioTune
reduces the number of trainable parameters, potentially leading to decreased
computational cost and facilitating more efficient transfer learning across
diverse data characteristics and distributions.

Motivation: 现有基于3D高斯泼溅的方法在处理驾驶场景时，虽然通过解耦动态和静态组件解决了运动模糊问题，但忽视了具有充分几何关系的背景优化，仅通过添加高斯来拟合每个训练视图，导致新视角渲染鲁棒性有限且缺乏准确的几何表示。

Conclusion: DriveSplat通过创新的动态-静态解耦策略、区域化初始化和几何先验监督，有效解决了驾驶场景3D重建中的挑战，实现了高质量的新视角渲染和准确的几何表示。

Abstract: In the realm of driving scenarios, the presence of rapidly moving vehicles,
pedestrians in motion, and large-scale static backgrounds poses significant
challenges for 3D scene reconstruction. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian
Splatting address the motion blur problem by decoupling dynamic and static
components within the scene. However, these decoupling strategies overlook
background optimization with adequate geometry relationships and rely solely on
fitting each training view by adding Gaussians. Therefore, these models exhibit
limited robustness in rendering novel views and lack an accurate geometric
representation. To address the above issues, we introduce DriveSplat, a
high-quality reconstruction method for driving scenarios based on neural
Gaussian representations with dynamic-static decoupling. To better accommodate
the predominantly linear motion patterns of driving viewpoints, a region-wise
voxel initialization scheme is employed, which partitions the scene into near,
middle, and far regions to enhance close-range detail representation.
Deformable neural Gaussians are introduced to model non-rigid dynamic actors,
whose parameters are temporally adjusted by a learnable deformation network.
The entire framework is further supervised by depth and normal priors from
pre-trained models, improving the accuracy of geometric structures. Our method
has been rigorously evaluated on the Waymo and KITTI datasets, demonstrating
state-of-the-art performance in novel-view synthesis for driving scenarios.

Method: 采用因果链建模视角分析RPM任务，设计DIO基线模型架构，并针对其局限性提出三种渐进改进方法。

Result: 实验发现DIO模型的互信息最大化优化目标无法让模型真正获得预设的人类推理逻辑，需要进一步改进。

Conclusion: 需要通过新的方法来克服互信息最大化的局限性，以更好地捕捉因果关系和提升抽象推理能力。

Abstract: Despite the outstanding performance of current deep learning models across
various domains, their fundamental bottleneck in abstract reasoning remains
unresolved. To address this challenge, the academic community has introduced
Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) problems as an authoritative benchmark for
evaluating the abstract reasoning capabilities of deep learning algorithms,
with a focus on core intelligence dimensions such as abstract reasoning,
pattern recognition, and complex problem-solving. Therefore, this paper centers
on solving RPM problems, aiming to contribute to enhancing the abstract
reasoning abilities of machine intelligence. Firstly, this paper adopts a
``causal chain modeling'' perspective to systematically analyze the complete
causal chain in RPM tasks: image $\rightarrow$ abstract attributes
$\rightarrow$ progressive attribute patterns $\rightarrow$ pattern consistency
$\rightarrow$ correct answer. Based on this analysis, the network architecture
of the baseline model DIO is designed. However, experiments reveal that the
optimization objective formulated for DIO, namely maximizing the variational
lower bound of mutual information between the context and the correct option,
fails to enable the model to genuinely acquire the predefined human reasoning
logic. This is attributed to two main reasons: the tightness of the lower bound
significantly impacts the effectiveness of mutual information maximization, and
mutual information, as a statistical measure, does not capture the causal
relationship between subjects and objects. To overcome these limitations, this
paper progressively proposes three improvement methods:

Motivation: 短视频内容兴起需要高效摘要技术，但现有方法难以捕捉全局时序依赖、保持语义连贯性，且多通道特征融合易受噪声影响

Method: 设计基于SNN的关键帧提取器，引入动态聚合图推理器解耦对象一致性和语义连贯性，使用变分推理重建模块处理特征融合中的不确定性和噪声

Result: 在SumMe、TVSum、VideoXum、QFVS等多个数据集上超越现有方法

Conclusion: SpiVG网络通过SNN和变分推理的结合，有效提升了视频摘要的信息密度和语义连贯性，同时降低了计算复杂度

Abstract: With the rise of short video content, efficient video summarization
techniques for extracting key information have become crucial. However,
existing methods struggle to capture the global temporal dependencies and
maintain the semantic coherence of video content. Additionally, these methods
are also influenced by noise during multi-channel feature fusion. We propose a
Spiking Variational Graph (SpiVG) Network, which enhances information density
and reduces computational complexity. First, we design a keyframe extractor
based on Spiking Neural Networks (SNN), leveraging the event-driven computation
mechanism of SNNs to learn keyframe features autonomously. To enable
fine-grained and adaptable reasoning across video frames, we introduce a
Dynamic Aggregation Graph Reasoner, which decouples contextual object
consistency from semantic perspective coherence. We present a Variational
Inference Reconstruction Module to address uncertainty and noise arising during
multi-channel feature fusion. In this module, we employ Evidence Lower Bound
Optimization (ELBO) to capture the latent structure of multi-channel feature
distributions, using posterior distribution regularization to reduce
overfitting. Experimental results show that SpiVG surpasses existing methods
across multiple datasets such as SumMe, TVSum, VideoXum, and QFVS. Our codes
and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/liwrui/SpiVG.

TL;DR: 该研究分析了MAE如何学习输入图像的空间相关性，推导了线性MAE学习的特征，证明掩码比例和补丁大小可用于选择捕获短程和长程空间相关性的特征，并扩展到非线性MAE，最后讨论了MAE超参数选择的实践见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管MAE已成为视觉基础模型的强大预训练技术，但在应用于新数据集时需要大量超参数调优（掩码比例、补丁大小、编码器/解码器层数）。现有理论研究主要关注注意力模式和分层潜变量模型，但MAE超参数与下游任务性能之间的关系相对未被探索。

Method: 通过分析推导线性MAE学习的特征，研究掩码比例和补丁大小如何选择捕获不同范围空间相关性的特征。然后将分析扩展到非线性MAE，证明MAE表示能够适应数据集中的空间相关性，超越二阶统计量。

Result: 研究发现掩码比例和补丁大小可以控制MAE学习特征的空间范围：较小的补丁和较高的掩码比例倾向于学习短程相关性，而较大的补丁和较低的掩码比例倾向于学习长程相关性。非线性MAE能够适应数据集中的复杂空间相关性模式。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了MAE学习空间相关性的理论分析框架，揭示了超参数选择与学习特征性质之间的关系，为实践中选择MAE超参数提供了有价值的见解，有助于在不同数据集上更有效地应用MAE预训练技术。

Abstract: Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) have emerged as a powerful pretraining technique
for vision foundation models. Despite their effectiveness, they require
extensive hyperparameter tuning (masking ratio, patch size, encoder/decoder
layers) when applied to novel datasets. While prior theoretical works have
analyzed MAEs in terms of their attention patterns and hierarchical latent
variable models, the connection between MAE hyperparameters and performance on
downstream tasks is relatively unexplored. This work investigates how MAEs
learn spatial correlations in the input image. We analytically derive the
features learned by a linear MAE and show that masking ratio and patch size can
be used to select for features that capture short- and long-range spatial
correlations. We extend this analysis to non-linear MAEs to show that MAE
representations adapt to spatial correlations in the dataset, beyond
second-order statistics. Finally, we discuss some insights on how to select MAE
hyper-parameters in practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的低分辨率图像给人脸检测带来重大挑战，影响检测性能，需要系统研究不同分辨率下主流深度学习人脸检测器的表现。

Method: 使用WIDER FACE数据集，在多种图像分辨率（160x160、320x320、640x640）下评估YOLOv11、YOLOv12和MTCNN三种模型，采用精确率、召回率、mAP50、mAP50-95和推理时间等指标。

Result: YOLOv11在检测准确率方面优于YOLOv12和MTCNN，特别是在较高分辨率下；YOLOv12召回率略好；MTCNN虽然在关键点定位方面有竞争力，但实时推理速度较慢。

Conclusion: 研究结果为根据不同操作约束选择分辨率感知的人脸检测模型提供了实用见解，YOLOv11适合高精度要求场景，YOLOv12在召回率敏感场景有优势。

Abstract: Face detection is a crucial component in many AI-driven applications such as
surveillance, biometric authentication, and human-computer interaction.
However, real-world conditions like low-resolution imagery present significant
challenges that degrade detection performance. In this study, we systematically
investigate the impact of input resolution on the accuracy and robustness of
three prominent deep learning-based face detectors: YOLOv11, YOLOv12, and
MTCNN. Using the WIDER FACE dataset, we conduct extensive evaluations across
multiple image resolutions (160x160, 320x320, and 640x640) and assess each
model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95,
and inference time. Results indicate that YOLOv11 outperforms YOLOv12 and MTCNN
in terms of detection accuracy, especially at higher resolutions, while YOLOv12
exhibits slightly better recall. MTCNN, although competitive in landmark
localization, lags in real-time inference speed. Our findings provide
actionable insights for selecting resolution-aware face detection models
suitable for varying operational constraints.

Conclusion: BIRD方法通过双向时间信息传播有效解决了传统滑动窗口方法的局限性，在红外小目标检测任务中表现出色

Abstract: Moving infrared small target detection is broadly adopted in infrared search
and track systems, and has attracted considerable research focus in recent
years. The existing learning-based multi-frame methods mainly aggregate the
information of adjacent frames in a sliding window fashion to assist the
detection of the current frame. However, the sliding-window-based methods do
not consider joint optimization of the entire video clip and ignore the global
temporal information outside the sliding window, resulting in redundant
computation and sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a
Bidirectional temporal information propagation method for moving InfraRed small
target Detection, dubbed BIRD. The bidirectional propagation strategy
simultaneously utilizes local temporal information of adjacent frames and
global temporal information of past and future frames in a recursive fashion.
Specifically, in the forward and backward propagation branches, we first design
a Local Temporal Motion Fusion (LTMF) module to model local spatio-temporal
dependency between a target frame and its two adjacent frames. Then, a Global
Temporal Motion Fusion (GTMF) module is developed to further aggregate the
global propagation feature with the local fusion feature. Finally, the
bidirectional aggregated features are fused and input into the detection head
for detection. In addition, the entire video clip is jointly optimized by the
traditional detection loss and the additional Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF)
loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed BIRD method not only
achieves the state-of-the-art performance but also shows a fast inference
speed.

Abstract: Conventional car damage inspection techniques are labor-intensive, manual,
and frequently overlook tiny surface imperfections like microscopic dents.
Machine learning provides an innovative solution to the increasing demand for
quicker and more precise inspection methods. The paper uses the YOLOv8 object
recognition framework to provide a deep learning-based solution for
automatically detecting microscopic surface flaws, notably tiny dents, on car
exteriors. Traditional automotive damage inspection procedures are manual,
time-consuming, and frequently unreliable at detecting tiny flaws. To solve
this, a bespoke dataset containing annotated photos of car surfaces under
various lighting circumstances, angles, and textures was created. To improve
robustness, the YOLOv8m model and its customized variants, YOLOv8m-t4 and
YOLOv8m-t42, were trained employing real-time data augmentation approaches.
Experimental results show that the technique has excellent detection accuracy
and low inference latency, making it suited for real-time applications such as
automated insurance evaluations and automobile inspections. Evaluation
parameters such as mean Average Precision (mAP), precision, recall, and
F1-score verified the model's efficacy. With a precision of 0.86, recall of
0.84, and F1-score of 0.85, the YOLOv8m-t42 model outperformed the YOLOv8m-t4
model (precision: 0.81, recall: 0.79, F1-score: 0.80) in identifying
microscopic surface defects. With a little reduced mAP@0.5:0.95 of 0.20, the
mAP@0.5 for YOLOv8m-t42 stabilized at 0.60. Furthermore, YOLOv8m-t42's PR curve
area was 0.88, suggesting more consistent performance than YOLOv8m-t4 (0.82).
YOLOv8m-t42 has greater accuracy and is more appropriate for practical dent
detection applications, even though its convergence is slower.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频到视频时刻检索任务需要处理语义帧级对齐和复杂依赖关系建模的挑战，现有方法在这些方面存在不足。

Method: 提出MATR模型，使用Transformer架构进行双阶段序列对齐，编码查询视频和目标视频之间的相关性，并结合自监督预训练技术来初始化模型。

Result: 在ActivityNet-VRL数据集上R@1提升13.1%，mIoU提升8.1%；在SportsMoments数据集上R@1提升14.7%，mIoU提升14.4%。

Conclusion: MATR通过有效的序列对齐和预训练策略，显著提升了视频到视频时刻检索的性能，为解决该任务的挑战提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Video-to-video moment retrieval (Vid2VidMR) is the task of localizing unseen
events or moments in a target video using a query video. This task poses
several challenges, such as the need for semantic frame-level alignment and
modeling complex dependencies between query and target videos. To tackle this
challenging problem, we introduce MATR (Moment Alignment TRansformer), a
transformer-based model designed to capture semantic context as well as the
temporal details necessary for precise moment localization. MATR conditions
target video representations on query video features using dual-stage sequence
alignment that encodes the required correlations and dependencies. These
representations are then used to guide foreground/background classification and
boundary prediction heads, enabling the model to accurately identify moments in
the target video that semantically match with the query video. Additionally, to
provide a strong task-specific initialization for MATR, we propose a
self-supervised pre-training technique that involves training the model to
localize random clips within videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MATR achieves notable performance improvements of 13.1% in R@1 and 8.1% in mIoU
on an absolute scale compared to state-of-the-art methods on the popular
ActivityNet-VRL dataset. Additionally, on our newly proposed dataset,
SportsMoments, MATR shows a 14.7% gain in R@1 and a 14.4% gain in mIoU on an
absolute scale over strong baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需SfM的3D高斯泼溅方法，能够在极稀疏视角输入下联合估计相机位姿和重建3D场景，显著提升渲染质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS依赖于密集多视角输入和精确相机位姿，但在现实场景中难以获得。当输入视角极其稀疏时，SfM初始化方法无法准确重建3D几何结构，导致渲染质量下降

Method: 提出密集立体模块逐步估计相机位姿信息并重建全局密集点云进行初始化；设计相干视图插值模块基于训练视图对插值相机位姿并生成视角一致的内容作为额外监督信号；引入多尺度拉普拉斯一致性正则化和自适应空间感知多尺度几何正则化

Result: 在极稀疏视角条件下（仅使用2个训练视图），PSNR指标显著提升2.75dB，合成图像失真最小且保留丰富高频细节，视觉质量优于现有技术

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了3DGS在极稀疏视角输入下的性能限制，为实际应用提供了更实用的解决方案

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable real-time
performance in novel view synthesis, yet its effectiveness relies heavily on
dense multi-view inputs with precisely known camera poses, which are rarely
available in real-world scenarios. When input views become extremely sparse,
the Structure-from-Motion (SfM) method that 3DGS depends on for initialization
fails to accurately reconstruct the 3D geometric structures of scenes,
resulting in degraded rendering quality. In this paper, we propose a novel
SfM-free 3DGS-based method that jointly estimates camera poses and reconstructs
3D scenes from extremely sparse-view inputs. Specifically, instead of SfM, we
propose a dense stereo module to progressively estimates camera pose
information and reconstructs a global dense point cloud for initialization. To
address the inherent problem of information scarcity in extremely sparse-view
settings, we propose a coherent view interpolation module that interpolates
camera poses based on training view pairs and generates viewpoint-consistent
content as additional supervision signals for training. Furthermore, we
introduce multi-scale Laplacian consistent regularization and adaptive
spatial-aware multi-scale geometry regularization to enhance the quality of
geometrical structures and rendered content. Experiments show that our method
significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art 3DGS-based approaches,
achieving a remarkable 2.75dB improvement in PSNR under extremely sparse-view
conditions (using only 2 training views). The images synthesized by our method
exhibit minimal distortion while preserving rich high-frequency details,
resulting in superior visual quality compared to existing techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有轻量级模型在医学图像分割中性能与效率的平衡问题，特别是缺乏全局上下文感知能力和通道冗余问题

Method: 采用异构层内卷积核提取局部高频信息并缓解通道冗余，集成稀疏Transformer-卷积混合分支捕获低频全局信息

Result: 在六个公共数据集上超越现有最先进方法，在四个未见数据集上的零样本泛化测试中保持优异性能

Conclusion: LGMSNet在资源有限的医疗场景中具有实际部署潜力，为轻量级医学图像分割提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a pivotal role in disease diagnosis and
treatment planning, particularly in resource-constrained clinical settings
where lightweight and generalizable models are urgently needed. However,
existing lightweight models often compromise performance for efficiency and
rarely adopt computationally expensive attention mechanisms, severely
restricting their global contextual perception capabilities. Additionally,
current architectures neglect the channel redundancy issue under the same
convolutional kernels in medical imaging, which hinders effective feature
extraction. To address these challenges, we propose LGMSNet, a novel
lightweight framework based on local and global dual multiscale that achieves
state-of-the-art performance with minimal computational overhead. LGMSNet
employs heterogeneous intra-layer kernels to extract local high-frequency
information while mitigating channel redundancy. In addition, the model
integrates sparse transformer-convolutional hybrid branches to capture
low-frequency global information. Extensive experiments across six public
datasets demonstrate LGMSNet's superiority over existing state-of-the-art
methods. In particular, LGMSNet maintains exceptional performance in zero-shot
generalization tests on four unseen datasets, underscoring its potential for
real-world deployment in resource-limited medical scenarios. The whole project

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的单视角方法ECON在3D人体重建方面表现良好，但无法充分利用多视角信息来提升几何细节和身体姿态估计的准确性。

Method: 提出联合多视角身体优化(JMBO)算法，在所有输入视角上联合拟合SMPL-X身体模型，确保多视角一致性；使用优化后的身体模型作为低频先验，通过法线图积分添加几何细节，整合前后视角的法线图来捕捉服装褶皱和发型等细节。

Result: 实验结果表明，MExECON相比单视角基线方法在保真度方面持续提升，与现代少样本3D重建方法相比具有竞争力。

Conclusion: MExECON成功扩展了单视角方法到多视角场景，通过多视角联合优化显著提升了3D人体重建的质量，特别是在几何细节和姿态估计方面，且无需额外的网络训练。

Abstract: This work presents MExECON, a novel pipeline for 3D reconstruction of clothed
human avatars from sparse multi-view RGB images. Building on the single-view
method ECON, MExECON extends its capabilities to leverage multiple viewpoints,
improving geometry and body pose estimation. At the core of the pipeline is the
proposed Joint Multi-view Body Optimization (JMBO) algorithm, which fits a
single SMPL-X body model jointly across all input views, enforcing multi-view
consistency. The optimized body model serves as a low-frequency prior that
guides the subsequent surface reconstruction, where geometric details are added
via normal map integration. MExECON integrates normal maps from both front and
back views to accurately capture fine-grained surface details such as clothing
folds and hairstyles. All multi-view gains are achieved without requiring any
network re-training. Experimental results show that MExECON consistently
improves fidelity over the single-view baseline and achieves competitive
performance compared to modern few-shot 3D reconstruction methods.

Motivation: 多模态图像融合面临模态不对齐、高频细节破坏和任务特定限制等挑战，需要一种通用的融合方法来克服这些限制。

Method: 提出AdaSFFuse框架，包含自适应近似小波变换(AdaWAT)进行频率解耦，以及空间-频率Mamba块进行跨域融合，实现多模态特征的对齐和整合。

Result: 在红外-可见光、多焦点、多曝光和医学图像融合四个任务上的实验表明，AdaSFFuse具有优越的融合性能，同时保持低计算成本和紧凑网络结构。

Conclusion: AdaSFFuse通过自适应频率分离和跨域融合机制，在多模态图像融合任务中实现了性能与效率的良好平衡，为通用融合方法提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Image Fusion (MMIF) aims to integrate complementary information
from different imaging modalities to overcome the limitations of individual
sensors. It enhances image quality and facilitates downstream applications such
as remote sensing, medical diagnostics, and robotics. Despite significant
advancements, current MMIF methods still face challenges such as modality
misalignment, high-frequency detail destruction, and task-specific limitations.
To address these challenges, we propose AdaSFFuse, a novel framework for
task-generalized MMIF through adaptive cross-domain co-fusion learning.
AdaSFFuse introduces two key innovations: the Adaptive Approximate Wavelet
Transform (AdaWAT) for frequency decoupling, and the Spatial-Frequency Mamba
Blocks for efficient multimodal fusion. AdaWAT adaptively separates the high-
and low-frequency components of multimodal images from different scenes,
enabling fine-grained extraction and alignment of distinct frequency
characteristics for each modality. The Spatial-Frequency Mamba Blocks
facilitate cross-domain fusion in both spatial and frequency domains, enhancing
this process. These blocks dynamically adjust through learnable mappings to
ensure robust fusion across diverse modalities. By combining these components,
AdaSFFuse improves the alignment and integration of multimodal features,
reduces frequency loss, and preserves critical details. Extensive experiments
on four MMIF tasks -- Infrared-Visible Image Fusion (IVF), Multi-Focus Image
Fusion (MFF), Multi-Exposure Image Fusion (MEF), and Medical Image Fusion (MIF)
-- demonstrate AdaSFFuse's superior fusion performance, ensuring both low
computational cost and a compact network, offering a strong balance between
performance and efficiency. The code will be publicly available at
https://github.com/Zhen-yu-Liu/AdaSFFuse.

Result: 在多个数据集、多样化多相机设置和各种生成先验上的广泛实验表明，ExtraGS显著提升了外推视图的真实性和几何一致性，同时在原始轨迹上保持高保真度。

Conclusion: ExtraGS通过整合几何和生成先验，有效解决了自动驾驶场景外推视图合成中的关键挑战，为高质量驾驶场景模拟提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Synthesizing extrapolated views from recorded driving logs is critical for
simulating driving scenes for autonomous driving vehicles, yet it remains a
challenging task. Recent methods leverage generative priors as pseudo ground
truth, but often lead to poor geometric consistency and over-smoothed
renderings. To address these limitations, we propose ExtraGS, a holistic
framework for trajectory extrapolation that integrates both geometric and
generative priors. At the core of ExtraGS is a novel Road Surface Gaussian(RSG)
representation based on a hybrid Gaussian-Signed Distance Function (SDF)
design, and Far Field Gaussians (FFG) that use learnable scaling factors to
efficiently handle distant objects. Furthermore, we develop a self-supervised
uncertainty estimation framework based on spherical harmonics that enables
selective integration of generative priors only where extrapolation artifacts
occur. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, diverse multi-camera setups,
and various generative priors demonstrate that ExtraGS significantly enhances
the realism and geometric consistency of extrapolated views, while preserving
high fidelity along the original trajectory.

Motivation: 现有方法在处理多对象交互和复杂运动时存在局限，要么仅限于单对象情况，要么存在时间不一致和泛化能力差的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：运动初始化和运动细化。第一阶段交互式分割语义组并定义关键帧，通过插值生成粗动画；第二阶段使用基于组的位移网络(GDN)预测组特定位移场，利用文本到视频模型的先验，并包含上下文条件特征增强(CCFE)等模块。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在生成高质量、时间一致的多对象复杂草图动画方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GroupSketch方法扩展了草图动画的实际应用范围，能够有效处理复杂的多对象交互场景。

Abstract: We introduce GroupSketch, a novel method for vector sketch animation that
effectively handles multi-object interactions and complex motions. Existing
approaches struggle with these scenarios, either being limited to single-object
cases or suffering from temporal inconsistency and poor generalization. To
address these limitations, our method adopts a two-stage pipeline comprising
Motion Initialization and Motion Refinement. In the first stage, the input
sketch is interactively divided into semantic groups and key frames are
defined, enabling the generation of a coarse animation via interpolation. In
the second stage, we propose a Group-based Displacement Network (GDN), which
refines the coarse animation by predicting group-specific displacement fields,
leveraging priors from a text-to-video model. GDN further incorporates
specialized modules, such as Context-conditioned Feature Enhancement (CCFE), to
improve temporal consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality,
temporally consistent animations for complex, multi-object sketches, thus
expanding the practical applications of sketch animation.

Method: 基于D-LinkNet编码器-解码器架构，提出三个关键创新：1）差分注意力扩张提取模块增强细微道路特征；2）双流解码融合机制平衡空间精度和语义上下文；3）多尺度扩张策略减少网格伪影

Result: 在DeepGlobe和CHN6-CUG基准测试中，D3FNet在具有挑战性的道路区域实现了优越的IoU和召回率，超越了最先进的基线方法

Conclusion: D3FNet通过注意力引导编码和双路径解码的互补协同作用，为复杂遥感和协同感知场景中的细粒度狭窄道路提取提供了鲁棒解决方案

Abstract: Extracting narrow roads from high-resolution remote sensing imagery remains a
significant challenge due to their limited width, fragmented topology, and
frequent occlusions. To address these issues, we propose D3FNet, a Dilated
Dual-Stream Differential Attention Fusion Network designed for fine-grained
road structure segmentation in remote perception systems. Built upon the
encoder-decoder backbone of D-LinkNet, D3FNet introduces three key
innovations:(1) a Differential Attention Dilation Extraction (DADE) module that
enhances subtle road features while suppressing background noise at the
bottleneck; (2) a Dual-stream Decoding Fusion Mechanism (DDFM) that integrates
original and attention-modulated features to balance spatial precision with
semantic context; and (3) a multi-scale dilation strategy (rates 1, 3, 5, 9)
that mitigates gridding artifacts and improves continuity in narrow road
prediction. Unlike conventional models that overfit to generic road widths,
D3FNet specifically targets fine-grained, occluded, and low-contrast road
segments. Extensive experiments on the DeepGlobe and CHN6-CUG benchmarks show
that D3FNet achieves superior IoU and recall on challenging road regions,
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies further verify the
complementary synergy of attention-guided encoding and dual-path decoding.
These results confirm D3FNet as a robust solution for fine-grained narrow road
extraction in complex remote and cooperative perception scenarios.

Conclusion: ADAPT方法无需源数据、梯度更新或完整访问目标数据，支持在线和转导设置，为测试时自适应提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) enhances the zero-shot robustness under
distribution shifts by leveraging unlabeled test data during inference. Despite
notable advances, several challenges still limit its broader applicability.
First, most methods rely on backpropagation or iterative optimization, which
limits scalability and hinders real-time deployment. Second, they lack explicit
modeling of class-conditional feature distributions. This modeling is crucial
for producing reliable decision boundaries and calibrated predictions, but it
remains underexplored due to the lack of both source data and supervision at
test time. In this paper, we propose ADAPT, an Advanced Distribution-Aware and
backPropagation-free Test-time adaptation method. We reframe TTA as a Gaussian
probabilistic inference task by modeling class-conditional likelihoods using
gradually updated class means and a shared covariance matrix. This enables
closed-form, training-free inference. To correct potential likelihood bias, we
introduce lightweight regularization guided by CLIP priors and a historical
knowledge bank. ADAPT requires no source data, no gradient updates, and no full
access to target data, supporting both online and transductive settings.
Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance under a wide range of distribution shifts
with superior scalability and robustness.

Motivation: 隐式神经表示(INR)存在频谱偏差问题，神经网络倾向学习低频分量而难以捕捉高频细节如锐利边缘和精细纹理

Method: 两阶段训练策略：第一阶段使用邻域感知软掩码自适应地为局部变化强烈的像素分配更高权重，优先学习高频细节；第二阶段过渡到全图像训练

Result: 实验结果表明该方法能持续改善重建质量，并与现有INR方法互补

Conclusion: 作为首个在图像INR中为像素分配频率感知重要性的尝试，为缓解频谱偏差问题提供了新途径

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful alternative
to traditional pixel-based formats by modeling images as continuous functions
over spatial coordinates. A key challenge, however, lies in the spectral bias
of neural networks, which tend to favor low-frequency components while
struggling to capture high-frequency (HF) details such as sharp edges and fine
textures. While prior approaches have addressed this limitation through
architectural modifications or specialized activation functions, we propose an
orthogonal direction by directly guiding the training process. Specifically, we
introduce a two-stage training strategy where a neighbor-aware soft mask
adaptively assigns higher weights to pixels with strong local variations,
encouraging early focus on fine details. The model then transitions to
full-image training. Experimental results show that our approach consistently
improves reconstruction quality and complements existing INR methods. As a
pioneering attempt to assign frequency-aware importance to pixels in image INR,
our work offers a new avenue for mitigating the spectral bias problem.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了点云配准的计算效率，虽然目前还不能解决完整的6自由度问题，但在旋转轴已知的情况下实现了快速全局最优求解。

Abstract: Recent results showed that point cloud registration with given
correspondences can be made robust to outlier rates of up to 95\% using the
truncated least squares (TLS) formulation. However, solving this combinatorial
optimization problem to global optimality is challenging. Provably globally
optimal approaches using semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations take
hundreds of seconds for 100 points. In this paper, we propose a novel linear
time convex relaxation as well as a contractor method to speed up Branch and
Bound (BnB). Our solver can register two 3D point clouds with 100 points to
provable global optimality in less than half a second when the axis of rotation
is provided. Although it currently cannot solve the full 6DoF problem, it is
two orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art SDP solver STRIDE when
solving the rotation-only TLS problem. In addition to providing a formal proof
for global optimality, we present empirical evidence of global optimality using
adversarial instances with local minimas close to the global minimum.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究结合相机陷阱和无人机热成像技术，使用深度学习模型自动识别野生动物和人类活动，通过空间模式分析识别人类与野生动物冲突区域，YOLOv11s模型在检测性能上表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解野生动物和人类活动的空间分布对于评估人兽冲突和制定有效保护规划至关重要，需要多视角监测方法来捕捉其分布模式。

Method: 在尼泊尔奇旺国家公园及周边地区，使用可见光/近红外相机陷阱和热红外无人机收集图像，构建深度学习模型（YOLOv11s和增强版Faster RCNN）进行自动识别，并进行空间模式分析。

Result: YOLOv11s模型达到96.2%精确率、92.3%召回率、96.7% mAP50和81.3% mAP50；无人机热成像提供了互补的空中视角；空间分析识别出明显的野生动物和人类活动热点区域及潜在冲突区。

Conclusion: 多视角监测与自动化目标检测相结合可增强野生动物监视和景观管理能力，揭示了保护景观内存在的人兽冲突问题。

Abstract: Wildlife and human activities are key components of landscape systems.
Understanding their spatial distribution is essential for evaluating human
wildlife interactions and informing effective conservation planning.
Multiperspective monitoring of wildlife and human activities by combining
camera traps and drone imagery. Capturing the spatial patterns of their
distributions, which allows the identification of the overlap of their activity
zones and the assessment of the degree of human wildlife conflict. The study
was conducted in Chitwan National Park (CNP), Nepal, and adjacent regions.
Images collected by visible and nearinfrared camera traps and thermal infrared
drones from February to July 2022 were processed to create training and testing
datasets, which were used to build deep learning models to automatic identify
wildlife and human activities. Drone collected thermal imagery was used for
detecting targets to provide a multiple monitoring perspective. Spatial pattern
analysis was performed to identify animal and resident activity hotspots and
delineation potential human wildlife conflict zones. Among the deep learning
models tested, YOLOv11s achieved the highest performance with a precision of
96.2%, recall of 92.3%, mAP50 of 96.7%, and mAP50 of 81.3%, making it the most
effective for detecting objects in camera trap imagery. Drone based thermal
imagery, analyzed with an enhanced Faster RCNN model, added a complementary
aerial viewpoint for camera trap detections. Spatial pattern analysis
identified clear hotspots for both wildlife and human activities and their
overlapping patterns within certain areas in the CNP and buffer zones
indicating potential conflict. This study reveals human wildlife conflicts
within the conserved landscape. Integrating multiperspective monitoring with
automated object detection enhances wildlife surveillance and landscape
management.

*Pengcheng Fang,Yuxia Chen,Rui Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Grounded VideoDiT是一个视频大语言模型，通过扩散时序潜在编码器、对象接地表示和混合令牌方案，显著提升了视频时间感知和实体交互的精确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频LLM在时间感知方面表现粗糙，时间戳编码隐式、帧级特征连续性差、语言视觉对齐漂移，需要更精确的时间定位和实体交互理解能力。

Method: 提出三个关键创新：1）扩散时序潜在编码器增强边界敏感性和时间一致性；2）对象接地表示显式绑定查询实体到局部视觉证据；3）混合令牌方案提供显式时间戳建模。

Result: 在Charades STA、NExT GQA和多个VideoQA基准测试中取得了最先进的结果，验证了强大的接地能力。

Conclusion: Grounded VideoDiT通过创新的时间感知和实体接地机制，成功解决了视频理解中时间定位和交互分析的挑战，为视频LLM提供了更精确的时间推理能力。

Abstract: Understanding videos requires more than answering open ended questions, it
demands the ability to pinpoint when events occur and how entities interact
across time. While recent Video LLMs have achieved remarkable progress in
holistic reasoning, they remain coarse in temporal perception: timestamps are
encoded only implicitly, frame level features are weak in capturing continuity,
and language vision alignment often drifts from the entities of interest. In
this paper, we present Grounded VideoDiT, a Video LLM designed to overcome
these limitations by introducing three key innovations. First, a Diffusion
Temporal Latent (DTL) encoder enhances boundary sensitivity and maintains
temporal consistency. Second, object grounded representations explicitly bind
query entities to localized visual evidence, strengthening alignment. Third, a
mixed token scheme with discrete temporal tokens provides explicit timestamp
modeling, enabling fine grained temporal reasoning. Together, these designs
equip Grounded VideoDiT with robust grounding capabilities, as validated by
state of the art results on Charades STA, NExT GQA, and multiple VideoQA
benchmarks.

*Swann Emilien Céleste Destouches,Jesse Lahaye,Laurent Valentin Jospin,Jan Skaloud*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种弱监督方法，通过人类操作员对初始分割结果进行质量评级，然后训练评级模型来改进树实例分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机载激光扫描数据的树实例分割对森林监测至关重要，但面临数据变化大和精确标注数据获取成本高的问题。

Method: 使用非微调模型或闭式算法获得初始分割结果，人类操作员进行质量评级，训练评级模型分类分割输出，最后用评级模型反馈微调分割模型。

Result: 原始分割模型的正确识别树实例数量提高了34%，同时显著减少了非树实例的预测数量。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提高了树实例分割性能，但在稀疏林区小树或复杂环境中仍存在挑战。

Abstract: Tree instance segmentation of airborne laser scanning (ALS) data is of utmost
importance for forest monitoring, but remains challenging due to variations in
the data caused by factors such as sensor resolution, vegetation state at
acquisition time, terrain characteristics, etc. Moreover, obtaining a
sufficient amount of precisely labeled data to train fully supervised instance
segmentation methods is expensive. To address these challenges, we propose a
weakly supervised approach where labels of an initial segmentation result
obtained either by a non-finetuned model or a closed form algorithm are
provided as a quality rating by a human operator. The labels produced during
the quality assessment are then used to train a rating model, whose task is to
classify a segmentation output into the same classes as specified by the human
operator. Finally, the segmentation model is finetuned using feedback from the
rating model. This in turn improves the original segmentation model by 34\% in
terms of correctly identified tree instances while considerably reducing the
number of non-tree instances predicted. Challenges still remain in data over
sparsely forested regions characterized by small trees (less than two meters in
height) or within complex surroundings containing shrubs, boulders, etc. which
can be confused as trees where the performance of the proposed method is
reduced.

*Shuchao Pang,Zhenghan Chen,Shen Zhang,Liming Lu,Siyuan Liang,Anan Du,Yongbin Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CFG方法，通过关键特征指导提升3D点云对抗样本的可迁移性，在黑盒攻击场景下无需目标模型信息即可生成高效对抗样本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中难以获取目标模型信息，现有3D对抗攻击方法依赖模型参数或输出信息，需要开发不依赖目标模型信息的迁移攻击方法

Method: 基于关键特征一致性观察，提出关键特征指导(CFG)方法，通过计算特征重要性来正则化对抗点云搜索，优先破坏不同架构可能采用的关键特征，并在损失函数中约束最大偏差以确保不可感知性

Result: 在ModelNet40和ScanObjectNN基准数据集上的大量实验表明，CFG方法大幅优于现有最先进的攻击方法

Conclusion: CFG方法通过关键特征指导有效提升了3D点云对抗样本的迁移能力，为黑盒攻击场景提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Deep neural networks for 3D point clouds have been demonstrated to be
vulnerable to adversarial examples. Previous 3D adversarial attack methods
often exploit certain information about the target models, such as model
parameters or outputs, to generate adversarial point clouds. However, in
realistic scenarios, it is challenging to obtain any information about the
target models under conditions of absolute security. Therefore, we focus on
transfer-based attacks, where generating adversarial point clouds does not
require any information about the target models. Based on our observation that
the critical features used for point cloud classification are consistent across
different DNN architectures, we propose CFG, a novel transfer-based black-box
attack method that improves the transferability of adversarial point clouds via
the proposed Critical Feature Guidance. Specifically, our method regularizes
the search of adversarial point clouds by computing the importance of the
extracted features, prioritizing the corruption of critical features that are
likely to be adopted by diverse architectures. Further, we explicitly constrain
the maximum deviation extent of the generated adversarial point clouds in the
loss function to ensure their imperceptibility. Extensive experiments conducted
on the ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN benchmark datasets demonstrate that the
proposed CFG outperforms the state-of-the-art attack methods by a large margin.

TL;DR: MapKD是一个多级跨模态知识蒸馏框架，通过教师-教练-学生范式将多模态模型的知识转移到轻量级视觉学生模型中，显著提升在线高精地图构建性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有在线高精地图构建方法依赖离线地图先验和多模态传感器，导致推理时计算开销大且依赖陈旧地图数据，需要开发更高效、低成本的视觉中心解决方案

Method: 提出MapKD框架：1）多模态教师模型（相机-LiDAR融合+SD/HD地图先验）；2）视觉中心教练模型（带先验知识和模拟LiDAR）；3）轻量级学生模型。采用TGPD和MSRD两种蒸馏策略进行特征对齐和语义学习指导

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，学生模型性能提升+6.68 mIoU和+10.94 mAP，同时推理速度加快

Conclusion: MapKD成功实现了从多模态模型到轻量级视觉模型的有效知识转移，为自动驾驶系统提供了高效、低成本的在线高精地图构建解决方案

Abstract: Online HD map construction is a fundamental task in autonomous driving
systems, aiming to acquire semantic information of map elements around the ego
vehicle based on real-time sensor inputs. Recently, several approaches have
achieved promising results by incorporating offline priors such as SD maps and
HD maps or by fusing multi-modal data. However, these methods depend on stale
offline maps and multi-modal sensor suites, resulting in avoidable
computational overhead at inference. To address these limitations, we employ a
knowledge distillation strategy to transfer knowledge from multimodal models
with prior knowledge to an efficient, low-cost, and vision-centric student
model. Specifically, we propose MapKD, a novel multi-level cross-modal
knowledge distillation framework with an innovative Teacher-Coach-Student (TCS)
paradigm. This framework consists of: (1) a camera-LiDAR fusion model with
SD/HD map priors serving as the teacher; (2) a vision-centric coach model with
prior knowledge and simulated LiDAR to bridge the cross-modal knowledge
transfer gap; and (3) a lightweight vision-based student model. Additionally,
we introduce two targeted knowledge distillation strategies: Token-Guided 2D
Patch Distillation (TGPD) for bird's eye view feature alignment and Masked
Semantic Response Distillation (MSRD) for semantic learning guidance. Extensive
experiments on the challenging nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MapKD improves
the student model by +6.68 mIoU and +10.94 mAP while simultaneously
accelerating inference speed. The code is available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CM2LoD3提出了一种基于冲突图(Conflict Maps)的新方法，通过语义分割和不确定性感知融合技术，自动重建包含立面细节的LoD3建筑模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LoD1和LoD2建筑模型缺乏立面细节元素，而LoD3模型虽然包含窗户、门等细节，但传统方法需要手动建模，难以大规模应用。

Method: 利用射线到模型先验分析获得冲突图(CMs)，通过开发的语义冲突图生成器(SCMG)生成合成冲突图进行语义分割，并结合纹理模型的附加分割进行不确定性感知融合。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在分割和重建建筑开口方面效果显著，通过不确定性感知融合纹理分割，性能达到61%。

Conclusion: 该研究推动了自动化LoD3模型重建的进步，为可扩展和高效的三维城市建模铺平了道路。

Abstract: Detailed 3D building models are crucial for urban planning, digital twins,
and disaster management applications. While Level of Detail 1 (LoD)1 and LoD2
building models are widely available, they lack detailed facade elements
essential for advanced urban analysis. In contrast, LoD3 models address this
limitation by incorporating facade elements such as windows, doors, and
underpasses. However, their generation has traditionally required manual
modeling, making large-scale adoption challenging. In this contribution,
CM2LoD3, we present a novel method for reconstructing LoD3 building models
leveraging Conflict Maps (CMs) obtained from ray-to-model-prior analysis.
Unlike previous works, we concentrate on semantically segmenting real-world CMs
with synthetically generated CMs from our developed Semantic Conflict Map
Generator (SCMG). We also observe that additional segmentation of textured
models can be fused with CMs using confidence scores to further increase
segmentation performance and thus increase 3D reconstruction accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our CM2LoD3 method in
segmenting and reconstructing building openings, with the 61% performance with
uncertainty-aware fusion of segmented building textures. This research
contributes to the advancement of automated LoD3 model reconstruction, paving
the way for scalable and efficient 3D city modeling. Our project is available:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该文章提出了MDPR框架，通过多维度动态提示路由机制来解决VLM在类别不平衡场景下细调时的偏见问题，在多个长尾分布数据集上达到了相当于SOTA方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决预训练视觉-语言模型(VLMs)在类别不平衡场景下细调时的偏见问题，尤其是预训练阶段本身存在的类别不平衡导致的偏见积累问题。

Method: 提出多维度动态提示路由(MDPR)框架：构建五个视觉-语义维度的类别知识库，通过动态路由机制对齐全局视觉类别、检索最优提示、平衡细粒度语义，并通过logits融合产生稳定预测。

Result: 在CIFAR-LT、ImageNet-LT和Places-LT等长尾分布数据集上进行了广泛实验，MDPR达到了与当前SOTA方法相当的结果。分离实验证明了语义库对尾部类别的有效性，且动态路由机制的计算开销很小。

Conclusion: MDPR是一种灵活且高效的VLM细调增强方案，能够有效解决数据不平衡条件下的偏见问题，为实际应用提供了可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
impressive capability in visual tasks, but their fine-tuning often suffers from
bias in class-imbalanced scene. Recent works have introduced large language
models (LLMs) to enhance VLM fine-tuning with supplementing semantic
information. However, they often overlook inherent class imbalance in VLMs'
pre-training, which may lead to bias accumulation in downstream tasks. To
address this problem, this paper proposes a Multi-dimensional Dynamic Prompt
Routing (MDPR) framework. MDPR constructs a comprehensive knowledge base for
classes, spanning five visual-semantic dimensions. During fine-tuning, the
dynamic routing mechanism aligns global visual classes, retrieves optimal
prompts, and balances fine-grained semantics, yielding stable predictions
through logits fusion. Extensive experiments on long-tailed benchmarks,
including CIFAR-LT, ImageNet-LT, and Places-LT, demonstrate that MDPR achieves
comparable results with current SOTA methods. Ablation studies further confirm
the effectiveness of our semantic library for tail classes, and show that our
dynamic routing incurs minimal computational overhead, making MDPR a flexible
and efficient enhancement for VLM fine-tuning under data imbalance.

TL;DR: StreamMem是一种查询无关的KV缓存内存机制，用于流式视频理解，通过注意力分数压缩KV缓存，在内存受限的长视频场景中实现高效问答。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在处理长视频时面临内存和计算开销大的问题，现有视觉压缩方法需要预先编码整个视觉上下文或提前获取问题，不适用于长视频理解和多轮对话场景。

Method: 提出StreamMem，以流式方式编码新视频帧，使用视觉token和通用查询token之间的注意力分数压缩KV缓存，同时维持固定大小的KV内存。

Result: 在三个长视频理解和两个流式视频问答基准测试中，StreamMem在查询无关KV缓存压缩方面达到最先进性能，与查询感知压缩方法竞争。

Conclusion: StreamMem为长视频理解和多轮对话提供了一种高效的查询无关KV缓存压缩解决方案，在内存受限场景下表现出色。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in
visual-language reasoning, but their ability to efficiently handle long videos
remains limited. Despite recent advances in long-context MLLMs, storing and
attending to the key-value (KV) cache for long visual contexts incurs
substantial memory and computational overhead. Existing visual compression
methods require either encoding the entire visual context before compression or
having access to the questions in advance, which is impractical for long video
understanding and multi-turn conversational settings. In this work, we propose
StreamMem, a query-agnostic KV cache memory mechanism for streaming video
understanding. Specifically, StreamMem encodes new video frames in a streaming
manner, compressing the KV cache using attention scores between visual tokens
and generic query tokens, while maintaining a fixed-size KV memory to enable
efficient question answering (QA) in memory-constrained, long-video scenarios.
Evaluation on three long video understanding and two streaming video question
answering benchmarks shows that StreamMem achieves state-of-the-art performance
in query-agnostic KV cache compression and is competitive with query-aware
compression approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成视频建模方法主要依赖RGB信号，在长序列中会导致对象结构和运动误差累积，需要解决长视频生成中的结构性和时间一致性问题。

Method: 提出WorldWeaver框架，联合预测感知条件和颜色信息，利用深度线索构建记忆库保存上下文信息，采用分段噪声调度训练预测组。

Result: 在基于扩散和整流流的模型上进行广泛实验，证明WorldWeaver能有效减少时间漂移并提高生成视频的保真度。

Conclusion: WorldWeaver通过统一的长期建模方案，显著提升了长视频生成的时间一致性和运动动态质量，为解决长序列视频生成中的漂移问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Generative video modeling has made significant strides, yet ensuring
structural and temporal consistency over long sequences remains a challenge.
Current methods predominantly rely on RGB signals, leading to accumulated
errors in object structure and motion over extended durations. To address these
issues, we introduce WorldWeaver, a robust framework for long video generation
that jointly models RGB frames and perceptual conditions within a unified
long-horizon modeling scheme. Our training framework offers three key
advantages. First, by jointly predicting perceptual conditions and color
information from a unified representation, it significantly enhances temporal
consistency and motion dynamics. Second, by leveraging depth cues, which we
observe to be more resistant to drift than RGB, we construct a memory bank that
preserves clearer contextual information, improving quality in long-horizon
video generation. Third, we employ segmented noise scheduling for training
prediction groups, which further mitigates drift and reduces computational
cost. Extensive experiments on both diffusion- and rectified flow-based models
demonstrate the effectiveness of WorldWeaver in reducing temporal drift and
improving the fidelity of generated videos.

Motivation: 现有的视觉基础模型（如SAM）在细粒度语义分割方面存在挑战，特别是在识别特定细胞亚型时表现不佳。需要开发能够减少详细像素级标注需求、同时提高分割精度的新方法。

Method: 采用全栈式方法：1) 通过分子赋能学习让非专业标注者参与标注；2) 使用SAM适配器调整模型以关注特定语义；3) 整合分子导向校正学习(MOCL)来提升分割准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅减轻了标注者的工作负担，还将精确的生物医学图像分析扩展到资源有限的环境中，推动了医学诊断和病理图像分析的自动化进程。

Abstract: Purpose: Recent developments in computational pathology have been driven by
advances in Vision Foundation Models, particularly the Segment Anything Model
(SAM). This model facilitates nuclei segmentation through two primary methods:
prompt-based zero-shot segmentation and the use of cell-specific SAM models for
direct segmentation. These approaches enable effective segmentation across a
range of nuclei and cells. However, general vision foundation models often face
challenges with fine-grained semantic segmentation, such as identifying
specific nuclei subtypes or particular cells. Approach: In this paper, we
propose the molecular-empowered All-in-SAM Model to advance computational
pathology by leveraging the capabilities of vision foundation models. This
model incorporates a full-stack approach, focusing on: (1) annotation-engaging
lay annotators through molecular-empowered learning to reduce the need for
detailed pixel-level annotations, (2) learning-adapting the SAM model to
emphasize specific semantics, which utilizes its strong generalizability with
SAM adapter, and (3) refinement-enhancing segmentation accuracy by integrating
Molecular-Oriented Corrective Learning (MOCL). Results: Experimental results
from both in-house and public datasets show that the All-in-SAM model
significantly improves cell classification performance, even when faced with
varying annotation quality. Conclusions: Our approach not only reduces the
workload for annotators but also extends the accessibility of precise
biomedical image analysis to resource-limited settings, thereby advancing
medical diagnostics and automating pathology image analysis.

Abstract: We present Waver, a high-performance foundation model for unified image and
video generation. Waver can directly generate videos with durations ranging
from 5 to 10 seconds at a native resolution of 720p, which are subsequently
upscaled to 1080p. The model simultaneously supports text-to-video (T2V),

quality, we establish a comprehensive data curation pipeline and manually
annotate and train an MLLM-based video quality model to filter for the
highest-quality samples. Furthermore, we provide detailed training and
inference recipes to facilitate the generation of high-quality videos. Building
on these contributions, Waver excels at capturing complex motion, achieving
superior motion amplitude and temporal consistency in video synthesis. Notably,
it ranks among the Top 3 on both the T2V and I2V leaderboards at Artificial

TL;DR: ATLAS是一个从60万高分辨率扫描数据学习的高保真人体模型，通过显式解耦形状和骨骼基座，在人体骨骼基础上构建网格表示，解决了现有方法在多样姿态和形状细节变化捕捉上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数化人体模型在捕捉多样化姿态和形状细节变化方面存在困难，主要由于训练数据多样性有限和建模假设限制，且传统方法中外表面优化与内部骨骼回归的依赖关系限制了直接控制身体高度和骨骼长度的能力。

Method: 从600k高分辨率扫描数据学习，使用240个同步相机采集数据，显式解耦形状和骨骼基座，在人体骨骼基础上构建网格表示，采用非线性姿态校正方法。

Result: ATLAS在拟合未见过的多样化姿态主体方面表现更准确，定量评估显示非线性姿态校正比线性模型更有效地捕捉复杂姿态。

Conclusion: ATLAS通过骨骼基础的显式解耦方法，实现了增强的形状表达能力、细粒度身体属性定制以及独立于外部软组织特征的关键点拟合，超越了现有方法的表现。

Abstract: Parametric body models offer expressive 3D representation of humans across a
wide range of poses, shapes, and facial expressions, typically derived by
learning a basis over registered 3D meshes. However, existing human mesh
modeling approaches struggle to capture detailed variations across diverse body
poses and shapes, largely due to limited training data diversity and
restrictive modeling assumptions. Moreover, the common paradigm first optimizes
the external body surface using a linear basis, then regresses internal
skeletal joints from surface vertices. This approach introduces problematic
dependencies between internal skeleton and outer soft tissue, limiting direct
control over body height and bone lengths. To address these issues, we present
ATLAS, a high-fidelity body model learned from 600k high-resolution scans
captured using 240 synchronized cameras. Unlike previous methods, we explicitly
decouple the shape and skeleton bases by grounding our mesh representation in
the human skeleton. This decoupling enables enhanced shape expressivity,
fine-grained customization of body attributes, and keypoint fitting independent
of external soft-tissue characteristics. ATLAS outperforms existing methods by
fitting unseen subjects in diverse poses more accurately, and quantitative
evaluations show that our non-linear pose correctives more effectively capture
complex poses compared to linear models.

Abstract: 3D content generation has recently attracted significant research interest
due to its applications in VR/AR and embodied AI. In this work, we address the
challenging task of synthesizing multiple 3D assets within a single scene
image. Concretely, our contributions are fourfold: (i) we present SceneGen, a
novel framework that takes a scene image and corresponding object masks as
input, simultaneously producing multiple 3D assets with geometry and texture.
Notably, SceneGen operates with no need for optimization or asset retrieval;
(ii) we introduce a novel feature aggregation module that integrates local and
global scene information from visual and geometric encoders within the feature
extraction module. Coupled with a position head, this enables the generation of
3D assets and their relative spatial positions in a single feedforward pass;

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VAREdit是一个基于视觉自回归模型的图像编辑框架，通过将图像编辑重构为多尺度预测问题，解决了扩散模型在指令引导编辑中的全局纠缠问题，实现了更精确的编辑效果和更高的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在指令引导图像编辑中存在全局去噪过程导致编辑区域与整个图像上下文纠缠的问题，产生不必要的伪修改和指令遵循度下降。自回归模型通过序列化合成过程提供了不同的解决方案。

Method: 提出VAREdit框架，将图像编辑重构为下一尺度预测问题。基于源图像特征和文本指令生成多尺度目标特征。引入尺度对齐参考(SAR)模块，在第一个自注意力层注入尺度匹配的条件信息。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，GPT-Balance分数比领先的扩散方法高出30%以上。512×512图像编辑仅需1.2秒，比同等规模的UltraEdit快2.2倍。

Conclusion: VAREdit通过自回归方法和尺度对齐机制，在编辑精度和效率方面都取得了显著进展，为指令引导图像编辑提供了新的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have brought remarkable visual fidelity
to instruction-guided image editing. However, their global denoising process
inherently entangles the edited region with the entire image context, leading
to unintended spurious modifications and compromised adherence to editing
instructions. In contrast, autoregressive models offer a distinct paradigm by
formulating image synthesis as a sequential process over discrete visual
tokens. Their causal and compositional mechanism naturally circumvents the
adherence challenges of diffusion-based methods. In this paper, we present
VAREdit, a visual autoregressive (VAR) framework that reframes image editing as
a next-scale prediction problem. Conditioned on source image features and text
instructions, VAREdit generates multi-scale target features to achieve precise
edits. A core challenge in this paradigm is how to effectively condition the
source image tokens. We observe that finest-scale source features cannot
effectively guide the prediction of coarser target features. To bridge this
gap, we introduce a Scale-Aligned Reference (SAR) module, which injects
scale-matched conditioning information into the first self-attention layer.
VAREdit demonstrates significant advancements in both editing adherence and
efficiency. On standard benchmarks, it outperforms leading diffusion-based
methods by 30\%+ higher GPT-Balance score. Moreover, it completes a
$512\times512$ editing in 1.2 seconds, making it 2.2$\times$ faster than the
similarly sized UltraEdit. The models are available at

*Haonan Qiu,Ning Yu,Ziqi Huang,Paul Debevec,Ziwei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CineScale是一种无需调优的推理范式，能够实现高分辨率视觉生成，支持8K图像和4K视频生成，解决了现有方法在高分辨率生成时出现的重复模式问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉扩散模型由于缺乏高分辨率数据和计算资源限制，通常只能在有限分辨率下训练，限制了其生成高保真高分辨率图像或视频的能力。现有方法在高分辨率生成时容易产生低质量内容和重复模式。

Method: 提出了CineScale推理范式，针对两种视频生成架构设计了专门的变体，能够实现高分辨率文本到图像、文本到视频、图像到视频和视频到视频的合成，基于最先进的开源视频生成框架构建。

Result: 大量实验验证了该范式在扩展高分辨率视觉生成能力方面的优越性，实现了无需微调的8K图像生成和仅需最小LoRA微调的4K视频生成。

Conclusion: CineScale成功解决了高分辨率视觉生成中的关键障碍，显著提升了预训练模型在高分辨率生成方面的潜力，为高保真视觉内容生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Visual diffusion models achieve remarkable progress, yet they are typically
trained at limited resolutions due to the lack of high-resolution data and
constrained computation resources, hampering their ability to generate
high-fidelity images or videos at higher resolutions. Recent efforts have
explored tuning-free strategies to exhibit the untapped potential
higher-resolution visual generation of pre-trained models. However, these
methods are still prone to producing low-quality visual content with repetitive
patterns. The key obstacle lies in the inevitable increase in high-frequency
information when the model generates visual content exceeding its training
resolution, leading to undesirable repetitive patterns deriving from the
accumulated errors. In this work, we propose CineScale, a novel inference
paradigm to enable higher-resolution visual generation. To tackle the various
issues introduced by the two types of video generation architectures, we
propose dedicated variants tailored to each. Unlike existing baseline methods
that are confined to high-resolution T2I and T2V generation, CineScale broadens
the scope by enabling high-resolution I2V and V2V synthesis, built atop
state-of-the-art open-source video generation frameworks. Extensive experiments
validate the superiority of our paradigm in extending the capabilities of
higher-resolution visual generation for both image and video models.
Remarkably, our approach enables 8k image generation without any fine-tuning,
and achieves 4k video generation with only minimal LoRA fine-tuning. Generated
video samples are available at our website:

*Jianfeng Si,Lin Sun,Zhewen Tan,Xiangzheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出统一的协同训练框架，通过单一SFT阶段整合多种安全行为（积极、消极、拒绝），使用系统指令或魔法令牌实现推理时的动态行为切换，显著降低训练复杂度和部署成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM内容安全方法（如SFT和RLHF）依赖多阶段训练流程，缺乏细粒度的部署后可控性，需要更高效灵活的解决方案。

Method: 采用统一的协同训练框架，在单一SFT阶段同时训练三种安全行为模式，通过系统级指令或魔法令牌在推理时动态激活不同行为模式。

Result: 8B模型在安全性能上超越DeepSeek-R1(671B)，匹配SFT+DPO的安全对齐质量，同时显著降低训练复杂度和部署成本。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了可扩展、高效且高度可控的LLM内容安全解决方案，通过安全对齐边际实现了前所未有的细粒度控制能力。

Abstract: Current methods for content safety in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
(RLHF), often rely on multi-stage training pipelines and lack fine-grained,
post-deployment controllability. To address these limitations, we propose a
unified co-training framework that efficiently integrates multiple safety
behaviors: positive (lawful/prosocial), negative (unfiltered/risk-prone) and
rejective (refusal-oriented/conservative) within a single SFT stage. Notably,
each behavior is dynamically activated via a simple system-level instruction,
or magic token, enabling stealthy and efficient behavioral switching at
inference time. This flexibility supports diverse deployment scenarios, such as
positive for safe user interaction, negative for internal red-teaming, and
rejective for context-aware refusals triggered by upstream moderation signals.
This co-training strategy induces a distinct Safety Alignment Margin in the
output space, characterized by well-separated response distributions
corresponding to each safety mode. The existence of this margin provides
empirical evidence for the model's safety robustness and enables unprecedented
fine-grained control. Experiments show that our method matches the safety
alignment quality of SFT+DPO, with our 8B model notably surpassing DeepSeek-R1
(671B) in safety performance, while significantly reducing both training
complexity and deployment costs. This work presents a scalable, efficient, and
highly controllable solution for LLM content safety.

based on human evaluation, which is more reliable and will supersede the
automatic ranking.
  The purpose of this report is not to present the final findings of the
General MT task, but rather to share preliminary results with task

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于大语言模型的文化本土化框架，自动生成包含本土实体的多语言数学应用题数据集，以解决现有翻译数据集中英语中心实体偏差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言和文化基础的数学推理在资源稀缺语言中较英语欠住，主要因为缺乏反映本土实体的社会文化任务数据集。现有多语言测试集主要通过翻译生成，保留了英语中心实体，影响了真实的多语言数学能力评估。

Method: 提出一种LLM驱动的文化本土化框架，能够从现有数据源自动构建包含本土名字、组织名称和货币等实体的数据集。

Result: 通过大量实验证明，该框架能够减少英语中心实体偏差，并在各种语言中引入本土实体时提高模型的稳健性。

Conclusion: 翻译的测试集可能隐藏了LLM在适当社会文化背景下的真实多语言数学能力，而自动本土化框架能有效解决这一问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in
solving mathematical problems expressed in natural language. However,
multilingual and culturally-grounded mathematical reasoning in low-resource
languages lags behind English due to the scarcity of socio-cultural task
datasets that reflect accurate native entities such as person names,
organization names, and currencies. Existing multilingual benchmarks are
predominantly produced via translation and typically retain English-centric
entities, owing to the high cost associated with human annotater-based
localization. Moreover, automated localization tools are limited, and hence,
truly localized datasets remain scarce. To bridge this gap, we introduce a
framework for LLM-driven cultural localization of math word problems that
automatically constructs datasets with native names, organizations, and
currencies from existing sources. We find that translated benchmarks can
obscure true multilingual math ability under appropriate socio-cultural
contexts. Through extensive experiments, we also show that our framework can
help mitigate English-centric entity bias and improves robustness when native
entities are introduced across various languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何利用少量易于生成的数据资源来改进通用指令调优大语言模型的机器翻译能力，特别是针对斯洛文尼亚语这样的低资源语言

Method: 使用Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)方法，通过程序化方式从公共数据集中筛选和增强数据。生成训练数据集时使用两个LLM（GaMS-9B-Instruct和EuroLLM-9B-Instruct）翻译英文维基百科文章，并基于启发式规则和COMET等自动评估指标对翻译结果进行质量排序

Result: 微调后的模型在翻译维基百科文章时，相比两个基线模型分别获得了约0.04和0.02的COMET分数提升，并且更一致地避免了语言和格式错误

Conclusion: DPO方法能够有效利用程序化生成的偏好数据来提升大语言模型的机器翻译性能，特别是在低资源语言翻译任务上表现出显著改进

Abstract: Large language models have emerged as effective machine translation systems.
In this paper, we explore how a general instruction-tuned large language model
can be improved for machine translation using relatively few easily produced
data resources. Using Slovene as a use case, we improve the GaMS-9B-Instruct
model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training on a programmatically
curated and enhanced subset of a public dataset. As DPO requires pairs of
quality-ranked instances, we generated its training dataset by translating
English Wikipedia articles using two LLMs, GaMS-9B-Instruct and
EuroLLM-9B-Instruct. We ranked the resulting translations based on heuristics
coupled with automatic evaluation metrics such as COMET. The evaluation shows
that our fine-tuned model outperforms both models involved in the dataset
generation. In comparison to the baseline models, the fine-tuned model achieved
a COMET score gain of around 0.04 and 0.02, respectively, on translating
Wikipedia articles. It also more consistently avoids language and formatting
errors.

Conclusion: 该工作通过创建多语言数据集和评估框架，显著推进了对话式可解释AI系统在多语言环境中的发展，解决了数据稀缺和自定义输入处理的关键问题。

Abstract: Conversational explainable artificial intelligence (ConvXAI) systems based on
large language models (LLMs) have garnered considerable attention for their
ability to enhance user comprehension through dialogue-based explanations.
Current ConvXAI systems often are based on intent recognition to accurately
identify the user's desired intention and map it to an explainability method.
While such methods offer great precision and reliability in discerning users'
underlying intentions for English, a significant challenge in the scarcity of
training data persists, which impedes multilingual generalization. Besides, the
support for free-form custom inputs, which are user-defined data distinct from
pre-configured dataset instances, remains largely limited. To bridge these
gaps, we first introduce MultiCoXQL, a multilingual extension of the CoXQL
dataset spanning five typologically diverse languages, including one
low-resource language. Subsequently, we propose a new parsing approach aimed at
enhancing multilingual parsing performance, and evaluate three LLMs on
MultiCoXQL using various parsing strategies. Furthermore, we present Compass, a
new multilingual dataset designed for custom input extraction in ConvXAI
systems, encompassing 11 intents across the same five languages as MultiCoXQL.
We conduct monolingual, cross-lingual, and multilingual evaluations on Compass,
employing three LLMs of varying sizes alongside BERT-type models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试时对齐技术虽然能提升LLM的安全性和推理能力，但往往带来巨大的推理成本，限制了实际应用。受推测采样加速技术的启发，希望解决测试时对齐的效率瓶颈问题

Method: SSS算法：让小型草稿模型与人类偏好对齐，而目标模型保持不变。通过修改接受准则和奖励代币分布，利用对齐草稿模型与未对齐目标模型之间的分布偏移来恢复RLHF最优解

Result: 在测试时弱到强对齐实验中，算法以显著降低的推理成本获得了优越的金牌奖励分数，验证了其有效性和效率

Conclusion: SSS算法成功解决了测试时对齐的高成本问题，通过创新的推测采样方法实现了高效的对齐效果，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences has become a
critical step in their development. Recent research has increasingly focused on
test-time alignment, where additional compute is allocated during inference to
enhance LLM safety and reasoning capabilities. However, these test-time
alignment techniques often incur substantial inference costs, limiting their
practical application. We are inspired by the speculative sampling
acceleration, which leverages a small draft model to efficiently predict future
tokens, to address the efficiency bottleneck of test-time alignment. We
introduce the reward-Shifted Speculative Sampling (SSS) algorithm, in which the
draft model is aligned with human preferences, while the target model remains
unchanged. We theoretically demonstrate that the distributional shift between
the aligned draft model and the unaligned target model can be exploited to
recover the RLHF optimal solution without actually obtaining it, by modifying
the acceptance criterion and bonus token distribution. Our algorithm achieves
superior gold reward scores at a significantly reduced inference cost in
test-time weak-to-strong alignment experiments, thereby validating both its
effectiveness and efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗、法律等关键领域，机器生成文本的完整性至关重要，但现有召回指标依赖词汇重叠容易出错，LLM评估方法存在幻觉和对齐问题。

Method: 三阶段框架：1)将答案分解为自包含事实 2)通过词汇和语义过滤缩小候选匹配 3)结构化蕴含检查验证对齐性

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的长文本问答基准测试中，相比强基线方法，LongRecall在召回准确性方面取得显著提升。

Conclusion: LongRecall通过结构化验证减少了假阳性和假阴性，适应多样化表达和上下文变化，为系统性召回评估提供了基础构建模块。

Abstract: LongRecall. The completeness of machine-generated text, ensuring that it
captures all relevant information, is crucial in domains such as medicine and
law and in tasks like list-based question answering (QA), where omissions can
have serious consequences. However, existing recall metrics often depend on
lexical overlap, leading to errors with unsubstantiated entities and
paraphrased answers, while LLM-as-a-Judge methods with long holistic prompts
capture broader semantics but remain prone to misalignment and hallucinations
without structured verification. We introduce LongRecall, a general three-stage
recall evaluation framework that decomposes answers into self-contained facts,
successively narrows plausible candidate matches through lexical and semantic
filtering, and verifies their alignment through structured entailment checks.
This design reduces false positives and false negatives while accommodating
diverse phrasings and contextual variations, serving as a foundational building
block for systematic recall assessment. We evaluate LongRecall on three
challenging long-form QA benchmarks using both human annotations and LLM-based
judges, demonstrating substantial improvements in recall accuracy over strong
lexical and LLM-as-a-Judge baselines.

Method: 结合LLM与组合推理方法，研究不同提示策略以估计LLM的信心值，并使用结构化预测目标进行校准和微调

Result: 符号推理在任何提示策略下都能提升预测一致性和准确性，结构化学习在LLM时代仍具有价值

Conclusion: 结合LLM与符号推理方法能有效解决结构化预测任务的挑战，结构化学习仍是重要技术

Abstract: LLMs have been shown to be useful for a variety of language tasks, without
requiring task-specific fine-tuning. However, these models often struggle with
hallucinations and complex reasoning problems due to their autoregressive
nature. We propose to address some of these issues, specifically in the area of
structured prediction, by combining LLMs with combinatorial inference in an
attempt to marry the predictive power of LLMs with the structural consistency
provided by inference methods. We perform exhaustive experiments in an effort
to understand which prompting strategies can effectively estimate LLM
confidence values for use with symbolic inference, and show that, regardless of
the prompting strategy, the addition of symbolic inference on top of prompting
alone leads to more consistent and accurate predictions. Additionally, we show
that calibration and fine-tuning using structured prediction objectives leads
to increased performance for challenging tasks, showing that structured
learning is still valuable in the era of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的数学数据集由于脆弱的提取启发式方法、有损的HTML到文本转换以及无法可靠保存数学结构，导致质量下降，需要更高质量的数学预训练数据。

Conclusion: 这是第一个能够从嘈杂的网络规模数据中可靠提取科学内容（包括数学）的流水线，在数学、代码和通用推理方面带来可衡量的提升，并在开放数学预训练语料库中设立了新的最先进水平。

Abstract: Pretraining large language models (LLMs) on high-quality, structured data
such as mathematics and code substantially enhances reasoning capabilities.
However, existing math-focused datasets built from Common Crawl suffer from
degraded quality due to brittle extraction heuristics, lossy HTML-to-text
conversion, and the failure to reliably preserve mathematical structure. In
this work, we introduce Nemotron-CC-Math, a large-scale, high-quality
mathematical corpus constructed from Common Crawl using a novel,
domain-agnostic pipeline specifically designed for robust scientific text
extraction.
  Unlike previous efforts, our pipeline recovers math across various formats
(e.g., MathJax, KaTeX, MathML) by leveraging layout-aware rendering with lynx
and a targeted LLM-based cleaning stage. This approach preserves the structural
integrity of equations and code blocks while removing boilerplate,
standardizing notation into LaTeX representation, and correcting
inconsistencies.
  We collected a large, high-quality math corpus, namely Nemotron-CC-Math-3+
(133B tokens) and Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ (52B tokens). Notably,
Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ not only surpasses all prior open math datasets-including
MegaMath, FineMath, and OpenWebMath-but also contains 5.5 times more tokens
than FineMath-4+, which was previously the highest-quality math pretraining
dataset. When used to pretrain a Nemotron-T 8B model, our corpus yields +4.8 to
+12.6 gains on MATH and +4.6 to +14.3 gains on MBPP+ over strong baselines,
while also improving general-domain performance on MMLU and MMLU-Stem.
  We present the first pipeline to reliably extract scientific
content--including math--from noisy web-scale data, yielding measurable gains
in math, code, and general reasoning, and setting a new state of the art among
open math pretraining corpora. To support open-source efforts, we release our
code and datasets.

Motivation: 人们经常提出包含错误假设的问题，这类问题没有常规答案。大型语言模型(LLM)由于幻觉现象往往会生成误导性回答，需要先识别错误假设。

Method: 将问题简化为事实验证，利用外部证据缓解幻觉，通过生成和验证原子假设来提供可解释的答案。

Result: 实验表明：(1)整合检索证据有益；(2)生成和验证原子假设能带来更大改进，并通过指定错误假设提供可解释的答案。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效识别和回答包含错误假设的问题，减少LLM的幻觉，提高回答的可解释性。

Abstract: People often ask questions with false assumptions, a type of question that
does not have regular answers. Answering such questions require first
identifying the false assumptions. Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate
misleading answers because of hallucinations. In this paper, we focus on
identifying and answering questions with false assumptions in several domains.
We first investigate to reduce the problem to fact verification. Then, we
present an approach leveraging external evidence to mitigate hallucinations.
Experiments with five LLMs demonstrate that (1) incorporating retrieved
evidence is beneficial and (2) generating and validating atomic assumptions
yields more improvements and provides an interpretable answer by specifying the
false assumptions.

Method: 提出MMDR-Bench测试集（包300个复杂多次对话场景）和CoLVLM Agent框架，通过"记忆-感知-规划-执行"迭代循环增强现有LVLM模型的推理能力，无需重新训练。

Conclusion: CoLVLM Agent的模块化设计和迭代方法在复杂多模态交互中表现出有效性，为解决长期上下文理解和深度推理问题提供了新方案。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), current models still face substantial
challenges in handling complex, multi-turn, and visually-grounded tasks that
demand deep reasoning, sustained contextual understanding, entity tracking, and
multi-step instruction following. Existing benchmarks often fall short in
capturing the dynamism and intricacies of real-world multi-modal interactions,
leading to issues such as context loss and visual hallucinations. To address
these limitations, we introduce MMDR-Bench (Multi-Modal Dialogue Reasoning
Benchmark), a novel dataset comprising 300 meticulously designed complex
multi-turn dialogue scenarios, each averaging 5-7 turns and evaluated across
six core dimensions including visual entity tracking and reasoning depth.
Furthermore, we propose CoLVLM Agent (Contextual LVLM Agent), a holistic
framework that enhances existing LVLMs with advanced reasoning and instruction
following capabilities through an iterative
"memory-perception-planning-execution" cycle, requiring no extensive
re-training of the underlying models. Our extensive experiments on MMDR-Bench
demonstrate that CoLVLM Agent consistently achieves superior performance,
attaining an average human evaluation score of 4.03, notably surpassing
state-of-the-art commercial models like GPT-4o (3.92) and Gemini 1.5 Pro
(3.85). The framework exhibits significant advantages in reasoning depth,
instruction adherence, and error suppression, and maintains robust performance
over extended dialogue turns, validating the effectiveness of its modular
design and iterative approach for complex multi-modal interactions.

### [79] [SemToken: Semantic-Aware Tokenization for Efficient Long-Context Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15190)
*Dong Liu,Yanxuan Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SemToken是一种语义感知的分词框架，通过语义聚类减少分词冗余，在保持模型性能的同时实现2.4倍分词减少和1.9倍加速


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分词方法如BPE和WordPiece仅基于频率统计，忽略了文本的语义结构，导致语义冗余区域的过度分词和上下文连贯性利用不足，特别是在长上下文场景中

Method: 首先通过轻量级编码器提取上下文语义嵌入，进行局部语义聚类合并语义等价的分词；然后基于语义密度分配异质分词粒度，在内容丰富区域使用细粒度分词，在重复或低熵区域使用粗粒度压缩

Result: 在WikiText-103和LongBench等长上下文语言建模基准测试中，SemToken实现了最多2.4倍的分词减少和1.9倍的加速，困惑度和下游任务准确率几乎没有下降

Conclusion: 语义结构为优化大语言模型中的分词和计算提供了一个有前景的新方向

Abstract: Tokenization plays a critical role in language modeling, yet existing
approaches such as Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) or WordPiece operate purely on
frequency statistics, ignoring the underlying semantic structure of text. This
leads to over-tokenization of semantically redundant spans and underutilization
of contextual coherence, particularly in long-context scenarios. In this work,
we propose \textbf{SemToken}, a semantic-aware tokenization framework that
jointly reduces token redundancy and improves computation efficiency. SemToken
first extracts contextual semantic embeddings via lightweight encoders and
performs local semantic clustering to merge semantically equivalent tokens.
Then, it allocates heterogeneous token granularity based on semantic density,
allowing finer-grained tokenization in content-rich regions and coarser
compression in repetitive or low-entropy spans. SemToken can be seamlessly
integrated with modern language models and attention acceleration methods.
Experiments on long-context language modeling benchmarks such as WikiText-103
and LongBench show that SemToken achieves up to $2.4\times$ reduction in token
count and $1.9\times$ speedup, with negligible or no degradation in perplexity
and downstream accuracy. Our findings suggest that semantic structure offers a
promising new axis for optimizing tokenization and computation in large
language models.

*Yuanchen Zhou,Shuo Jiang,Jie Zhu,Junhui Li,Lifan Guo,Feng Chen,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fin-PRM是一个专门针对金融领域设计的流程奖励模型，通过整合步骤级和轨迹级奖励监督，在金融推理任务中显著优于通用PRMs和领域基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的流程奖励模型主要针对通用或STEM领域，在金融等专业领域中表现不足，因为金融推理需要更结构化、符号化且对事实和监管正确性敏感。

Method: 开发Fin-PRM模型，整合步骤级和轨迹级奖励监督，支持离线/在线奖励学习，应用于监督微调、强化学习和测试时推理三个关键场景。

Result: 在CFLUE和FinQA基准测试中，Fin-PRM在轨迹选择质量上持续优于基线模型，下游模型性能提升显著：监督学习12.9%、强化学习5.2%、测试时性能5.1%。

Conclusion: 领域专业化的奖励建模对于使大语言模型与专家级金融推理对齐具有重要价值，Fin-PRM为金融领域的推理监督提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have emerged as a promising framework for
supervising intermediate reasoning in large language models (LLMs), yet
existing PRMs are primarily trained on general or Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) domains and fall short in domain-specific
contexts such as finance, where reasoning is more structured, symbolic, and
sensitive to factual and regulatory correctness. We introduce \textbf{Fin-PRM},
a domain-specialized, trajectory-aware PRM tailored to evaluate intermediate
reasoning steps in financial tasks. Fin-PRM integrates step-level and
trajectory-level reward supervision, enabling fine-grained evaluation of
reasoning traces aligned with financial logic. We apply Fin-PRM in both offline
and online reward learning settings, supporting three key applications: (i)
selecting high-quality reasoning trajectories for distillation-based supervised
fine-tuning, (ii) providing dense process-level rewards for reinforcement
learning, and (iii) guiding reward-informed Best-of-N inference at test time.
Experimental results on financial reasoning benchmarks, including CFLUE and
FinQA, demonstrate that Fin-PRM consistently outperforms general-purpose PRMs
and strong domain baselines in trajectory selection quality. Downstream models
trained with Fin-PRM yield substantial improvements with baselines, with gains
of 12.9\% in supervised learning, 5.2\% in reinforcement learning, and 5.1\% in
test-time performance. These findings highlight the value of domain-specialized
reward modeling for aligning LLMs with expert-level financial reasoning. Our
project resources will be available at https://github.com/aliyun/qwen-dianjin.

### [81] [SparK: Query-Aware Unstructured Sparsity with Recoverable KV Cache Channel Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15212)
*Huanxuan Liao,Yixing Xu,Shizhu He,Guanchen Li,Xuanwu Yin,Dong Li,Emad Barsoum,Jun Zhao,Kang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPARK是一种无需训练的即插即用方法，通过在通道级别对KV缓存进行剪枝来减少长上下文推理中的内存和计算开销，同时保持模型精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KV缓存压缩方法主要关注时间轴压缩，忽略了特征维度（通道轴）上的重要性差异，导致效率和准确性平衡受限。

Method: 提出SPARK方法，在通道级别对KV缓存进行非结构化稀疏剪枝，并在注意力计算过程中动态恢复被剪枝的条目。

Result: SPARK在相同内存预算下可处理更长序列，相比基于驱逐的方法减少30%以上KV缓存存储，即使80%剪枝率下性能下降也小于5%。

Conclusion: SPARK是一种有效且鲁棒的KV缓存压缩方法，与现有技术正交兼容，可进一步加速长上下文推理。

Abstract: Long-context inference in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly
constrained by the KV cache bottleneck: memory usage grows linearly with
sequence length, while attention computation scales quadratically. Existing
approaches address this issue by compressing the KV cache along the temporal
axis through strategies such as token eviction or merging to reduce memory and
computational overhead. However, these methods often neglect fine-grained
importance variations across feature dimensions (i.e., the channel axis),
thereby limiting their ability to effectively balance efficiency and model
accuracy. In reality, we observe that channel saliency varies dramatically
across both queries and positions: certain feature channels carry near-zero
information for a given query, while others spike in relevance. To address this
oversight, we propose SPARK, a training-free plug-and-play method that applies
unstructured sparsity by pruning KV at the channel level, while dynamically
restoring the pruned entries during attention score computation. Notably, our
approach is orthogonal to existing KV compression and quantization techniques,
making it compatible for integration with them to achieve further acceleration.
By reducing channel-level redundancy, SPARK enables processing of longer
sequences within the same memory budget. For sequences of equal length, SPARK
not only preserves or improves model accuracy but also reduces KV cache storage
by over 30% compared to eviction-based methods. Furthermore, even with an
aggressive pruning ratio of 80%, SPARK maintains performance with less
degradation than 5% compared to the baseline eviction method, demonstrating its
robustness and effectiveness. Our code will be available at
https://github.com/Xnhyacinth/SparK.

*Bolei He,Xinran He,Run Shao,Shanfu Shu,Xianwei Xue,Mingquan Cheng,Haifeng Li,Zhenhua Ling*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Selct2Know (S2K) 是一个成本效益高的框架，通过内部-外部知识自选择策略和选择性监督微调来内化领域知识，在医学、法律和金融QA基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在通用QA中表现良好，但在特定领域场景中表现不佳。检索增强生成存在幻觉和延迟问题，而持续预训练成本高且缺乏跨领域灵活性。领域知识的长尾分布导致部分有用内部知识未被充分利用。

Method: 提出Selct2Know框架，采用内部-外部知识自选择策略和选择性监督微调来内化领域知识。引入结构化推理数据生成流程，并集成GRPO来增强推理能力。

Result: 在医学、法律和金融QA基准测试中，S2K始终优于现有方法，并以显著更低的成本达到领域预训练LLM的性能水平。

Conclusion: S2K框架通过渐进式知识获取策略，有效解决了领域特定QA中的知识利用问题，在多个领域实现了优异的性能表现和成本效益。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in general QA but often struggle in
domain-specific scenarios. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) introduces
external knowledge but suffers from hallucinations and latency due to noisy
retrievals. Continued pretraining internalizes domain knowledge but is costly
and lacks cross-domain flexibility. We attribute this challenge to the
long-tail distribution of domain knowledge, which leaves partial yet useful
internal knowledge underutilized. We further argue that knowledge acquisition
should be progressive, mirroring human learning: first understanding concepts,
then applying them to complex reasoning. To address this, we propose Selct2Know
(S2K), a cost-effective framework that internalizes domain knowledge through an
internal-external knowledge self-selection strategy and selective supervised
fine-tuning. We also introduce a structured reasoning data generation pipeline
and integrate GRPO to enhance reasoning ability. Experiments on medical, legal,
and financial QA benchmarks show that S2K consistently outperforms existing
methods and matches domain-pretrained LLMs with significantly lower cost.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SEER是一种自引导方法，通过从持续更新的经验池中进行细粒度、逐步检索来解决LLM在多步骤工具使用中的挑战，相比静态或手动策划的方法，能持续扩展经验池并随时间提高模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖手动设计任务特定演示或从策划库中检索，需要大量专家努力，且随着工具多样性和任务难度增加，提示工程变得复杂低效。

Method: Stepwise Experience Recall (SEER)方法，从持续更新的经验池执行细粒度逐步检索，增量式地用过去成功轨迹增强经验池。

Result: 在ToolQA基准测试中，SEER在简单和困难问题上分别平均提升6.1%和4.7%；在τ-bench真实世界领域测试中，使用Qwen2.5-7B和Qwen2.5-72B模型分别获得7.44%和23.38%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: SEER方法通过自引导的经验检索机制有效解决了LLM在多步骤工具使用中的挑战，实现了持续的性能改进。

Abstract: Function calling enables large language models (LLMs) to interact with
external systems by leveraging tools and APIs. When faced with multi-step tool
usage, LLMs still struggle with tool selection, parameter generation, and
tool-chain planning. Existing methods typically rely on manually designing
task-specific demonstrations, or retrieving from a curated library. These
approaches demand substantial expert effort and prompt engineering becomes
increasingly complex and inefficient as tool diversity and task difficulty
scale. To address these challenges, we propose a self-guided method, Stepwise
Experience Recall (SEER), which performs fine-grained, stepwise retrieval from
a continually updated experience pool. Instead of relying on static or manually
curated library, SEER incrementally augments the experience pool with past
successful trajectories, enabling continuous expansion of the pool and improved
model performance over time. Evaluated on the ToolQA benchmark, SEER achieves
an average improvement of 6.1\% on easy and 4.7\% on hard questions. We further
test SEER on $\tau$-bench, which includes two real-world domains. Powered by
Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen2.5-72B models, SEER demonstrates substantial accuracy gains
of 7.44\% and 23.38\%, respectively.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了在生成任务自动评估中如何有效使用检查表，发现选择性使用检查表在成对比较任务中能提升评估性能，但在直接评分中效果不一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在生成任务自动评估中存在标准模糊的问题，自动生成检查表是一种有前景但尚未充分探索的方法。

Method: 使用六种方法生成检查表，在八种不同规模的模型上进行实验，通过成对比较和直接评分任务评估检查表效果，并分析检查表项与人工评估的相关性。

Result: 选择性使用检查表在成对比较设置中能改善评估性能，但在直接评分中效果不稳定。即使与人工评分相关性低的检查表项也常反映人工编写的标准，表明人工评估存在不一致性。

Conclusion: 需要更清晰地定义客观评估标准来指导人工和自动评估，检查表在特定场景下是有效的评估工具。

Abstract: Automatic evaluation of generative tasks using large language models faces
challenges due to ambiguous criteria. Although automatic checklist generation
is a potentially promising approach, its usefulness remains underexplored. We
investigate whether checklists should be used for all questions or selectively,
generate them using six methods, evaluate their effectiveness across eight
model sizes, and identify checklist items that correlate with human
evaluations. Through experiments on pairwise comparison and direct scoring
tasks, we find that selective checklist use tends to improve evaluation
performance in pairwise settings, while its benefits are less consistent in
direct scoring. Our analysis also shows that even checklist items with low
correlation to human scores often reflect human-written criteria, indicating
potential inconsistencies in human evaluation. These findings highlight the
need to more clearly define objective evaluation criteria to guide both human
and automatic evaluations. \footnote{Our code is available

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VocabTailor是一个解耦的动态词汇选择框架，通过卸载嵌入和混合静态-动态词汇选择策略，显著减少小型语言模型词汇相关组件的内存占用，最高可达99%，同时保持任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小型语言模型在资源受限环境中具有计算优势，但词汇相关组件（嵌入和语言建模头）由于词汇量大而占用大量内存，现有静态词汇剪枝方法存在信息损失和缺乏灵活性的问题。

Method: 基于词汇局部性原则和词汇相关组件计算特性的不对称性，提出VocabTailor框架：通过卸载嵌入实现内存约束处理，并为LM头采用混合静态-动态词汇选择策略，实现按需加载词汇组件。

Result: 在多样化下游任务上的综合实验表明，VocabTailor能够将词汇相关组件的内存使用减少高达99%，且任务性能几乎没有下降，显著优于现有静态词汇剪枝方法。

Conclusion: VocabTailor通过动态词汇选择有效解决了小型语言模型在边缘设备部署中的内存瓶颈问题，在保持性能的同时大幅降低内存占用。

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) provide computational advantages in
resource-constrained environments, yet memory limitations remain a critical
bottleneck for edge device deployment. A substantial portion of SLMs' memory
footprint stems from vocabulary-related components, particularly embeddings and
language modeling (LM) heads, due to large vocabulary sizes. Existing static
vocabulary pruning, while reducing memory usage, suffers from rigid,
one-size-fits-all designs that cause information loss from the prefill stage
and a lack of flexibility. In this work, we identify two key principles
underlying the vocabulary reduction challenge: the lexical locality principle,
the observation that only a small subset of tokens is required during any
single inference, and the asymmetry in computational characteristics between
vocabulary-related components of SLM. Based on these insights, we introduce
VocabTailor, a novel decoupled dynamic vocabulary selection framework that
addresses memory constraints through offloading embedding and implements a
hybrid static-dynamic vocabulary selection strategy for LM Head, enabling
on-demand loading of vocabulary components. Comprehensive experiments across
diverse downstream tasks demonstrate that VocabTailor achieves a reduction of
up to 99% in the memory usage of vocabulary-related components with minimal or
no degradation in task performance, substantially outperforming existing static
vocabulary pruning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在英语中表现优异，但在泰语等低资源语言中表现待探索。现有测试集多依赖翻译，缺乏文化和领域特定的细节，影响实际应用效果。

Method: 通过多阶段质量控制流程，由标注员、领域专家和AI研究人员协作创建WangchanThaiInstruct数据集，涵盖四个专业领域和七种任务类型。进行两个研究：(1)零样本评估文化和专业特定任务的表现差距；(2)指令调整研究，隔离本土监督的效果。

Result: 使用WangchanThaiInstruct调整的模型在领域内外测试中都超过使用翻译数据的模型。

Conclusion: 研究突出了需要基于文化和专业基础的本土指令数据，才能提高大语言模型在低资源、语言多样性环境中的对齐性能。

Abstract: Large language models excel at instruction-following in English, but their
performance in low-resource languages like Thai remains underexplored. Existing
benchmarks often rely on translations, missing cultural and domain-specific
nuances needed for real-world use. We present WangchanThaiInstruct, a
human-authored Thai dataset for evaluation and instruction tuning, covering
four professional domains and seven task types. Created through a multi-stage
quality control process with annotators, domain experts, and AI researchers,
WangchanThaiInstruct supports two studies: (1) a zero-shot evaluation showing
performance gaps on culturally and professionally specific tasks, and (2) an
instruction tuning study with ablations isolating the effect of native
supervision. Models fine-tuned on WangchanThaiInstruct outperform those using
translated data in both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks. These findings
underscore the need for culturally and professionally grounded instruction data
to improve LLM alignment in low-resource, linguistically diverse settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决代码切换(CS)语音技术中数据集稀缺的问题，因为CS在真实对话中很常见但对多语言语音技术构成重大挑战

Method: 使用SWORDS算法（同义词替换单词），在保持句子语义不变的前提下，通过替换选定单词为其翻译来生成CS语音，同时考虑词性

Result: 构建的CS-FLEURS语料库在客观和主观指标上都达到了高可懂度和自然度，与现有数据集性能相当

Conclusion: 该方法有望推动CS语音技术的发展，使多语言系统更具包容性

Abstract: Code-switching (CS), the alternation between two or more languages within a
single speaker's utterances, is common in real-world conversations and poses
significant challenges for multilingual speech technology. However, systems
capable of handling this phenomenon remain underexplored, primarily due to the
scarcity of suitable datasets. To resolve this issue, we propose Universal
Code-Mixer (UniCoM), a novel pipeline for generating high-quality, natural CS
samples without altering sentence semantics. Our approach utilizes an algorithm
we call Substituting WORDs with Synonyms (SWORDS), which generates CS speech by
replacing selected words with their translations while considering their parts
of speech. Using UniCoM, we construct Code-Switching FLEURS (CS-FLEURS), a
multilingual CS corpus designed for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and
speech-to-text translation (S2TT). Experimental results show that CS-FLEURS
achieves high intelligibility and naturalness, performing comparably to
existing datasets on both objective and subjective metrics. We expect our
approach to advance CS speech technology and enable more inclusive multilingual
systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了EMNLP框架，用于评估教师角色大语言模型的心理特征、道德发展阶段和伦理风险，发现教师角色LLM比人类教师更理想化和极化，抽象道德推理强但情感复杂情境弱，推理能力强的模型更容易受到有害提示注入攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型模拟专业角色（如教师）时缺乏全面的心理和伦理评估，需要建立专门的评估框架来确保教育AI的伦理和心理对齐。

Method: 提出EMNLP框架，扩展现有量表并构建88个教师特定道德困境，使用定向软提示注入集评估教师角色LLM的合规性和脆弱性，在12个LLM上进行实验。

Result: 教师角色LLM表现出比人类教师更理想化和极化的个性特征，在抽象道德推理方面表现优异，但在情感复杂情境中表现较差；推理能力强的模型更容易受到有害提示注入攻击。

Conclusion: 这是首个评估教师角色LLM伦理和心理对齐的基准，揭示了能力与安全性之间的悖论，模型温度等超参数对风险行为影响有限，为教育AI的伦理发展提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Simulating Professions (SP) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to emulate
professional roles. However, comprehensive psychological and ethical evaluation
in these contexts remains lacking. This paper introduces EMNLP, an
Educator-role Moral and Normative LLMs Profiling framework for personality
profiling, moral development stage measurement, and ethical risk under soft
prompt injection. EMNLP extends existing scales and constructs 88
teacher-specific moral dilemmas, enabling profession-oriented comparison with
human teachers. A targeted soft prompt injection set evaluates compliance and
vulnerability in teacher SP. Experiments on 12 LLMs show teacher-role LLMs
exhibit more idealized and polarized personalities than human teachers, excel
in abstract moral reasoning, but struggle with emotionally complex situations.
Models with stronger reasoning are more vulnerable to harmful prompt injection,
revealing a paradox between capability and safety. The model temperature and
other hyperparameters have limited influence except in some risk behaviors.
This paper presents the first benchmark to assess ethical and psychological
alignment of teacher-role LLMs for educational AI. Resources are available at

Result: 在QA和事实核查基准测试中平均获得5.0%的性能提升，有效缓解了上下文-记忆冲突问题

Conclusion: CARE为构建可信赖和自适应的RAG系统提供了有前景的方向，能够更好地处理外部知识与内部知识的冲突

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances the capabilities of large
language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge into their input
prompts. However, when the retrieved context contradicts the LLM's parametric
knowledge, it often fails to resolve the conflict between incorrect external
context and correct parametric knowledge, known as context-memory conflict. To
tackle this problem, we introduce Conflict-Aware REtrieval-Augmented Generation
(CARE), consisting of a context assessor and a base LLM. The context assessor
encodes compact memory token embeddings from raw context tokens. Through
grounded/adversarial soft prompting, the context assessor is trained to discern
unreliable context and capture a guidance signal that directs reasoning toward
the more reliable knowledge source. Extensive experiments show that CARE
effectively mitigates context-memory conflicts, leading to an average
performance gain of 5.0\% on QA and fact-checking benchmarks, establishing a
promising direction for trustworthy and adaptive RAG systems.

Motivation: 自然语言中事件的时间上下文往往没有明确表述，即使是先进的大语言模型也难以生成需要时间常识推理的文本。自动挖掘时间常识有助于构建更鲁棒的语言模型。

Method: 提出了时间常识提取管道，利用大语言模型从SAMSum和RealNews语料库中自动挖掘时间常识，构建TComQA数据集，并通过众包验证。

Result: TComQA数据集在提取时间常识方面达到80%以上的精确度，使用该数据集训练的模型在时间问答任务上优于基于现有数据集微调的大语言模型。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效提取高质量的时间常识知识，提升语言模型在时间推理任务上的表现，为构建更智能的语言理解系统提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Understanding events necessitates grasping their temporal context, which is
often not explicitly stated in natural language. For example, it is not a
trivial task for a machine to infer that a museum tour may last for a few
hours, but can not take months. Recent studies indicate that even advanced
large language models (LLMs) struggle in generating text that require reasoning
with temporal commonsense due to its infrequent explicit mention in text.
Therefore, automatically mining temporal commonsense for events enables the
creation of robust language models. In this work, we investigate the capacity
of LLMs to extract temporal commonsense from text and evaluate multiple
experimental setups to assess their effectiveness. Here, we propose a temporal
commonsense extraction pipeline that leverages LLMs to automatically mine
temporal commonsense and use it to construct TComQA, a dataset derived from
SAMSum and RealNews corpora. TComQA has been validated through crowdsourcing
and achieves over 80\% precision in extracting temporal commonsense. The model
trained with TComQA also outperforms an LLM fine-tuned on existing dataset of
temporal question answering task.

Motivation: 许多语音处理任务需要不受语境影响的纯净音素表示，但传统方法需要分析长语音片段和语言特定模式

Method: 处理短固定宽度窗口（约一个音素长度）并独立分析，学习所有语言共有的基础声学模式，采用监督和自监督训练

Result: 在包括UCLA语音语料库零样本测试在内的多语言评估中表现出强大的跨语言泛化能力，参数量少于当前方法但性能相当

Conclusion: 通过建模音素长度窗口内的基础声学模式，可以实现有效的通用语音处理

Abstract: Universal phoneme recognition typically requires analyzing long speech
segments and language-specific patterns. Many speech processing tasks require
pure phoneme representations free from contextual influence, which motivated
our development of CUPE - a lightweight model that captures key phoneme
features in just 120 milliseconds, about one phoneme's length. CUPE processes
short, fixed-width windows independently and, despite fewer parameters than
current approaches, achieves competitive cross-lingual performance by learning
fundamental acoustic patterns common to all languages. Our extensive evaluation
through supervised and self-supervised training on diverse languages, including
zero-shot tests on the UCLA Phonetic Corpus, demonstrates strong cross-lingual
generalization and reveals that effective universal speech processing is
possible through modeling basic acoustic patterns within phoneme-length
windows.

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) enable applications in various domains such as
semantic search, recommendation systems, and natural language processing. KGs
are often incomplete, missing entities and relations, an issue addressed by
Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) methods that predict missing elements.
Different evaluation metrics, such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Mean Rank
(MR), and Hit@k, are commonly used to assess the performance of such KGC
models. A major challenge in evaluating KGC models, however, lies in comparing
their performance across multiple datasets and metrics. A model may outperform
others on one dataset but underperform on another, making it difficult to
determine overall superiority. Moreover, even within a single dataset,
different metrics such as MRR and Hit@1 can yield conflicting rankings, where
one model excels in MRR while another performs better in Hit@1, further
complicating model selection for downstream tasks. These inconsistencies hinder
holistic comparisons and highlight the need for a unified meta-metric that
integrates performance across all metrics and datasets to enable a more
reliable and interpretable evaluation framework. To address this need, we
propose KG Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS), a robust
and interpretable meta-metric that synthesizes model performance across
multiple datasets and diverse evaluation criteria into a single normalized
score ($M_i \in [0,1]$). Unlike traditional metrics that focus on isolated
aspects of performance, EDAS offers a global perspective that supports more
informed model selection and promotes fairness in cross-dataset evaluation.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets such as FB15k-237 and WN18RR
demonstrate that EDAS effectively integrates multi-metric, multi-dataset
performance into a unified ranking, offering a consistent, robust, and
generalizable framework for evaluating KGC models.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统综述了283个大语言模型评测基准，将其分为通用能力、领域特定和目标特定三类，指出了当前基准存在数据污染导致分数膨胀、文化语言偏见导致评估不公等问题，并提供了未来基准创新的参考设计范式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型能力的深度和广度快速发展，相应的评测基准大量涌现。作为模型性能的量化评估工具，基准不仅是衡量模型能力的核心手段，也是指导模型发展方向和促进技术创新的关键要素。

Method: 系统综述当前大语言模型评测基准的发展现状，将283个代表性基准分为三类：通用能力基准（涵盖核心语言学、知识、推理等方面）、领域特定基准（聚焦自然科学、人文社科、工程技术等领域）和目标特定基准（关注风险、可靠性、智能体等）。

Result: 识别出现有基准存在的主要问题：数据污染导致的分数膨胀、文化语言偏见造成的不公平评估、过程可信度和动态环境评估的缺失。

Conclusion: 为未来基准创新提供了可参考的设计范式，强调需要解决现有基准的局限性，以更全面、公平地评估大语言模型的真实能力。

Abstract: In recent years, with the rapid development of the depth and breadth of large
language models' capabilities, various corresponding evaluation benchmarks have
been emerging in increasing numbers. As a quantitative assessment tool for
model performance, benchmarks are not only a core means to measure model
capabilities but also a key element in guiding the direction of model
development and promoting technological innovation. We systematically review
the current status and development of large language model benchmarks for the
first time, categorizing 283 representative benchmarks into three categories:
general capabilities, domain-specific, and target-specific. General capability
benchmarks cover aspects such as core linguistics, knowledge, and reasoning;
domain-specific benchmarks focus on fields like natural sciences, humanities
and social sciences, and engineering technology; target-specific benchmarks pay
attention to risks, reliability, agents, etc. We point out that current
benchmarks have problems such as inflated scores caused by data contamination,
unfair evaluation due to cultural and linguistic biases, and lack of evaluation
on process credibility and dynamic environments, and provide a referable design
paradigm for future benchmark innovation.

TL;DR: MultiTrust-X是一个全面的多模态大语言模型可信度评估基准，包含5个可信度维度、2种新型风险类型和多种缓解策略，通过32个任务和28个数据集对30多个模型进行评估，揭示了当前模型的显著漏洞，并提出了推理增强的安全对齐方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型评估方法往往关注狭窄方面，忽视了多模态性带来的风险，需要构建一个全面的可信度评估框架来解决这些挑战。

Method: 提出了MultiTrust-X基准，定义了三维度框架：5个可信度方面（真实性、鲁棒性、安全性、公平性、隐私）、2种新型风险类型（多模态风险和跨模态影响）以及多种缓解策略。包含32个任务和28个精选数据集，评估了30多个开源和专有模型。

Result: 实验揭示了当前模型的显著漏洞，包括可信度与通用能力之间的差距，以及多模态训练和推理对基础LLM潜在风险的放大。现有缓解策略存在关键局限性，虽然某些方法在特定方面有所改进，但很少有方法能有效解决整体可信度问题，且许多方法会引入意外的权衡而损害模型效用。

Conclusion: 基于研究发现提出了推理增强的安全对齐（RESA）方法，通过赋予模型思维链推理能力来发现潜在风险，取得了最先进的结果，为未来改进提供了实用见解。

Abstract: The trustworthiness of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) remains an
intense concern despite the significant progress in their capabilities.
Existing evaluation and mitigation approaches often focus on narrow aspects and
overlook risks introduced by the multimodality. To tackle these challenges, we
propose MultiTrust-X, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating, analyzing, and
mitigating the trustworthiness issues of MLLMs. We define a three-dimensional
framework, encompassing five trustworthiness aspects which include
truthfulness, robustness, safety, fairness, and privacy; two novel risk types
covering multimodal risks and cross-modal impacts; and various mitigation
strategies from the perspectives of data, model architecture, training, and
inference algorithms. Based on the taxonomy, MultiTrust-X includes 32 tasks and
28 curated datasets, enabling holistic evaluations over 30 open-source and
proprietary MLLMs and in-depth analysis with 8 representative mitigation
methods. Our extensive experiments reveal significant vulnerabilities in
current models, including a gap between trustworthiness and general
capabilities, as well as the amplification of potential risks in base LLMs by
both multimodal training and inference. Moreover, our controlled analysis
uncovers key limitations in existing mitigation strategies that, while some
methods yield improvements in specific aspects, few effectively address overall
trustworthiness, and many introduce unexpected trade-offs that compromise model
utility. These findings also provide practical insights for future
improvements, such as the benefits of reasoning to better balance safety and
performance. Based on these insights, we introduce a Reasoning-Enhanced Safety
Alignment (RESA) approach that equips the model with chain-of-thought reasoning
ability to discover the underlying risks, achieving state-of-the-art results.

TL;DR: 通过信息论框架基于信心调制的推理机制，动态调整预测长度和验证标准，提高自回归推理速度保持输出质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预测解码方法使用静态预测长度和固定验证标准，无法适应不同模型不确定性和输入复杂度

Method: 利用预测模型输出分布的熵和信息谨测量，动态调整每次迭代的预测标记数量，并基于同样的信心信号调节验证过程

Result: 在机器翻译和摘要任务中实现显著速度提升，同时保持或改善了BLEU和ROUGE评分

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种可插入的原理性方法，能够在不同不确定性条件下实现大语言模型的高效和稳健解码

Abstract: Speculative decoding has emerged as an effective approach for accelerating
autoregressive inference by parallelizing token generation through a
draft-then-verify paradigm. However, existing methods rely on static drafting
lengths and rigid verification criteria, limiting their adaptability across
varying model uncertainties and input complexities. This paper proposes an
information-theoretic framework for speculative decoding based on
confidence-modulated drafting. By leveraging entropy and margin-based
uncertainty measures over the drafter's output distribution, the proposed
method dynamically adjusts the number of speculatively generated tokens at each
iteration. This adaptive mechanism reduces rollback frequency, improves
resource utilization, and maintains output fidelity. Additionally, the
verification process is modulated using the same confidence signals, enabling
more flexible acceptance of drafted tokens without sacrificing generation
quality. Experiments on machine translation and summarization tasks demonstrate
significant speedups over standard speculative decoding while preserving or
improving BLEU and ROUGE scores. The proposed approach offers a principled,
plug-in method for efficient and robust decoding in large language models under
varying conditions of uncertainty.

### [96] [Exploiting Vocabulary Frequency Imbalance in Language Model Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15390)
*Woojin Chung,Jeonghoon Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过实验证明语言模型中词汇表大小的增长主要通过降低文本的复杂性来改善性能，而非解决词频不平衡问题。模型实际上利用了词频不平衡来优化常见词的预测准确度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型的词汇表趋向越来越大，但其帮助的根源不清楚。论文想通过控制实验来明确大词汇表对模型性能的真正影响机制。

Method: 在保持数据、计算资源和优化固定的前提下，将词汇表从24K扩展到196K，并使用Kolmogorov复杂性来定量文本的复杂性。还进行了词级损失分解分析。

Result: 词汇表越大，文本的复杂性越低。超过24K后，词汇表扩大主要降低前2,500个常见词的不确定性，而尾部稀有词的损失反而上升。模型实际上利用了词频不平衡来获得性能改善。

Conclusion: 词汇表大小的好处应重新解释为"降低文本的复杂性"，而非解决词频不平衡。这为切词器与模型的协同设计提供了理论基础，也清楚了语言模型扩缩过程中的损失动态机制。

Abstract: Large language models are trained with tokenizers, and the resulting token
distribution is highly imbalanced: a few words dominate the stream while most
occur rarely. Recent practice favors ever-larger vocabularies, but the source
of the benefit is unclear. We conduct a controlled study that scales the
language model's vocabulary from 24K to 196K while holding data, compute, and
optimization fixed. We first quantify the complexity of tokenized text,
formalized via Kolmogorov complexity, and show that larger vocabularies reduce
this complexity. Above 24K, every common word is already a single token, so
further growth mainly deepens the relative token-frequency imbalance. A
word-level loss decomposition shows that larger vocabularies reduce
cross-entropy almost exclusively by lowering uncertainty on the 2,500 most
frequent words, even though loss on the rare tail rises. Constraining input and
output embedding norms to attenuate the effect of token-frequency imbalance
reverses the gain, directly showing that the model exploits rather than suffers
from imbalance. Because the same frequent words cover roughly 77% of tokens in
downstream benchmarks, this training advantage transfers intact. We also show
that enlarging model parameters with a fixed vocabulary yields the same
frequent-word benefit. Our results reframe "bigger vocabularies help" as
"lowering the complexity of tokenized text helps," providing a simple,
principled lever for tokenizer-model co-design and clarifying the loss dynamics
that govern language-model scaling in pre-training.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) has been accompanied
by growing concerns regarding their reliability and trustworthiness. As a
result, a growing body of research focuses on evidence-based text generation
with LLMs, aiming to link model outputs to supporting evidence to ensure
traceability and verifiability. However, the field is fragmented due to
inconsistent terminology, isolated evaluation practices, and a lack of unified
benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we systematically analyze 134 papers, introduce
a unified taxonomy of evidence-based text generation with LLMs, and investigate
300 evaluation metrics across seven key dimensions. Thereby, we focus on
approaches that use citations, attribution, or quotations for evidence-based
text generation. Building on this, we examine the distinctive characteristics
and representative methods in the field. Finally, we highlight open challenges
and outline promising directions for future work.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了首个专门评估大音频语言模型在处理音频-文本冲突信息时偏好的基准MCR-BENCH，发现模型存在显著的文本偏向性，经常忽略音频证据，导致音频中心任务性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大音频语言模型具备音频感知能力，但其在处理音频和文本模态间冲突信息时的表现尚未得到充分研究，需要系统评估模型在多模态冲突情况下的可靠性。

Method: 构建MCR-BENCH基准，通过不一致的音频-文本对评估模型的信息优先级选择，分析影响因素，探索监督微调缓解策略，并分析模型置信度模式。

Result: 研究发现LALMs存在显著的文本偏向性，在模态不一致时经常忽视音频证据，导致音频任务性能显著下降，且模型在矛盾输入时仍表现出持续过度自信。

Conclusion: 需要在训练过程中改进模态平衡，开发更复杂的融合机制，以增强处理冲突多模态输入时的鲁棒性，提高模型在实际应用中的可靠性。

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) are enhanced with audio perception
capabilities, enabling them to effectively process and understand multimodal
inputs that combine audio and text. However, their performance in handling
conflicting information between audio and text modalities remains largely
unexamined. This paper introduces MCR-BENCH, the first comprehensive benchmark
specifically designed to evaluate how LALMs prioritize information when
presented with inconsistent audio-text pairs. Through extensive evaluation
across diverse audio understanding tasks, we reveal a concerning phenomenon:
when inconsistencies exist between modalities, LALMs display a significant bias
toward textual input, frequently disregarding audio evidence. This tendency
leads to substantial performance degradation in audio-centric tasks and raises
important reliability concerns for real-world applications. We further
investigate the influencing factors of text bias, and explore mitigation
strategies through supervised finetuning, and analyze model confidence patterns
that reveal persistent overconfidence even with contradictory inputs. These
findings underscore the need for improved modality balance during training and
more sophisticated fusion mechanisms to enhance the robustness when handling
conflicting multi-modal inputs. The project is available at

Motivation: 大型语音语言模型发展受限于碎片化架构和缺乏透明度，阻碍了系统比较和研究的可复现性。该领域普遍存在只发布模型权重而不公开训练数据和配置的问题。

Method: 开发LLaSO框架，包含三个核心资源：1) LLaSO-Align语音文本对齐语料库(1200万实例)；2) LLaSO-Instruct多任务指令调优数据集(1350万实例)；3) LLaSO-Eval可复现评估基准。基于公开数据训练了3.8B参数的LLaSO-Base参考模型。

Result: LLaSO-Base模型获得0.72的标准化分数，超越了同类可比模型，建立了强大的可复现基线。分析显示更广泛的训练覆盖能提升性能，但在未见任务上仍存在显著泛化差距，特别是在纯音频场景中。

Conclusion: 通过完整发布数据、基准测试和模型，LLaSO建立了基础性开放标准，旨在统一研究努力并加速社区驱动的大型语音语言模型发展。

Abstract: The development of Large Speech-Language Models (LSLMs) has been slowed by
fragmented architectures and a lack of transparency, hindering the systematic
comparison and reproducibility of research. Unlike in the vision-language
domain, the LSLM field suffers from the common practice of releasing model
weights without their corresponding training data and configurations. To
address these critical gaps, we introduce LLaSO, the first fully open,
end-to-end framework for large-scale speech-language modeling. LLaSO provides
the community with three essential resources: (1) LLaSO-Align, a 12M-instance
speech-text alignment corpus; (2) LLaSO-Instruct, a 13.5M-instance multi-task
instruction-tuning dataset; and (3) LLaSO-Eval, a reproducible benchmark for
standardized evaluation. To validate our framework, we build and release
LLaSO-Base, a 3.8B-parameter reference model trained exclusively on our public
data. It achieves a normalized score of 0.72, establishing a strong,
reproducible baseline that surpasses comparable models. Our analysis reveals
that while broader training coverage enhances performance, significant
generalization gaps persist on unseen tasks, particularly in pure audio
scenarios. By releasing the complete stack of data, benchmarks, and models,
LLaSO establishes a foundational open standard to unify research efforts and
accelerate community-driven progress in LSLMs. We release the code, dataset,
pretrained models, and results in https://github.com/EIT-NLP/LLaSO.

overview of these approaches, highlights their strengths, and investigates
their limitations. The outcomes of this study contribute to the ongoing
research on privacy-preserving language modeling, providing valuable insights

Abstract: These pure languages understanding directly relates to translation knowledge
where linguists and translators need to work and research to eradicate
misunderstanding. Misunderstandings mostly appear in non-equivalent words
because there are different local and internal words like food, garment,
cultural and traditional words and others in every notion. Truly, most of these
words do not have equivalent in the target language and these words need to be
worked and find their equivalent in the target language to fully understand the
both languages. The purpose of this research is to introduce the methods of
rendering non-equivalent words professionally from the source language to the
target language and this research has been completed using library-based
research. However, some of these non-equivalent words are already
professionally rendered to the target language but still there many other words
to be rendered. As a result, this research paper includes different ways and
rules of rendering non-equivalent words from source language to the target
language and 25 non-equvalent words have been rendered from Dar & Uzbek into

Motivation: 现有的可编程任务导向对话代理的有效性依赖于准确的对话状态跟踪，但传统方法存在局限性，需要更有效的状态跟踪和错误纠正机制。

Method: 采用简单的约束解码方法，使用语言模型而非语法规则来遵循API模式，生成可执行代码进行状态跟踪，并利用策略和执行反馈进行错误纠正。

Result: 在具有挑战性的SGD基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，在准确性和鲁棒性用户目标估计方面均超越了强基线模型。

Conclusion: 执行感知的状态跟踪方法非常有效，PyTOD通过代码生成和反馈机制显著提升了对话状态跟踪的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Programmable task-oriented dialogue (TOD) agents enable language models to
follow structured dialogue policies, but their effectiveness hinges on accurate
state tracking. We present PyTOD, an agent that generates executable code to
track dialogue state and uses policy and execution feedback for efficient error
correction. To this end, PyTOD employs a simple constrained decoding approach,
using a language model instead of grammar rules to follow API schemata. This
leads to state-of-the-art state tracking performance on the challenging SGD
benchmark. Our experiments show that PyTOD surpasses strong baselines in both
accuracy and robust user goal estimation as the dialogue progresses,
demonstrating the effectiveness of execution-aware state tracking.

Method: 基于Group Relative Policy Optimization，创新性地引入子分数动态加权和多数引导优势缩放技术，自适应调整临床挑战性错误类型的优先级和策略梯度更新

Result: 在ReXVal基准测试中，RadReason超越了所有现有离线指标，达到与GPT-4评估相当的水平，同时保持可解释性和成本效益

Conclusion: RadReason提供了一个临床可部署、可解释且高效的放射学报告评估解决方案，填补了现有方法的空白

Abstract: Evaluating automatically generated radiology reports remains a fundamental
challenge due to the lack of clinically grounded, interpretable, and
fine-grained metrics. Existing methods either produce coarse overall scores or
rely on opaque black-box models, limiting their usefulness in real-world
clinical workflows. We introduce RadReason, a novel evaluation framework for
radiology reports that not only outputs fine-grained sub-scores across six
clinically defined error types, but also produces human-readable justifications
that explain the rationale behind each score. Our method builds on Group
Relative Policy Optimization and incorporates two key innovations: (1)
Sub-score Dynamic Weighting, which adaptively prioritizes clinically
challenging error types based on live F1 statistics; and (2) Majority-Guided
Advantage Scaling, which adjusts policy gradient updates based on prompt
difficulty derived from sub-score agreement. Together, these components enable
more stable optimization and better alignment with expert clinical judgment.
Experiments on the ReXVal benchmark show that RadReason surpasses all prior
offline metrics and achieves parity with GPT-4-based evaluations, while
remaining explainable, cost-efficient, and suitable for clinical deployment.
Code will be released upon publication.

Conclusion: 对比学习目标在推进个性化营销方面非常有效，SLM4Offer模型展示了在个性化优惠生成任务中的优越性能。

Abstract: Personalized marketing has emerged as a pivotal strategy for enhancing
customer engagement and driving business growth. Academic and industry efforts
have predominantly focused on recommendation systems and personalized
advertisements. Nonetheless, this facet of personalization holds significant
potential for increasing conversion rates and improving customer satisfaction.
Prior studies suggest that well-executed personalization strategies can boost
revenue by up to 40 percent, underscoring the strategic importance of
developing intelligent, data-driven approaches for offer generation. This work
introduces SLM4Offer, a generative AI model for personalized offer generation,
developed by fine-tuning a pre-trained encoder-decoder language model,
specifically Google's Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5-Small 60M) using a
contrastive learning approach. SLM4Offer employs InfoNCE (Information
Noise-Contrastive Estimation) loss to align customer personas with relevant
offers in a shared embedding space. A key innovation in SLM4Offer lies in the
adaptive learning behaviour introduced by contrastive loss, which reshapes the
latent space during training and enhances the model's generalizability. The
model is fine-tuned and evaluated on a synthetic dataset designed to simulate
customer behaviour and offer acceptance patterns. Experimental results
demonstrate a 17 percent improvement in offer acceptance rate over a supervised
fine-tuning baseline, highlighting the effectiveness of contrastive objectives
in advancing personalized marketing.

Method: 提出HeTLM聚类语言模型训练方法，通过为不同的异质性聚类设置特定的参数集，使用页面级别的tokenizer训练小型模型。

Result: 小型LM在浏览语言任务上表现超过大型预训练或微调模型；HeTLM在控制参数数量的情况下超过单一模型；实现更高的平均性能和更低的方差。

Conclusion: 聚类特定的模型训练方法能够更好地处理用户主观性行为的异质性，小型专门模型在特定领域可能比大型通用模型更有效。

Abstract: A Large Language Model (LLM) offers versatility across domains and tasks,
purportedly benefiting users with a wide variety of behaviors and preferences.
We question this perception about an LLM when users have inherently subjective
behaviors and preferences, as seen in their ubiquitous and idiosyncratic
browsing of websites or apps. The sequential behavior logs of pages, thus
generated, form something akin to each user's self-constructed "language",
albeit without the structure and grammar imbued in natural languages. We ask:
(i) Can a small LM represent the "language of browsing" better than a large LM?
(ii) Can an LM with a single set of parameters (or, single LM) adequately
capture myriad users' heterogeneous, subjective behaviors and preferences?
(iii) Can a single LM with high average performance, yield low variance in
performance to make alignment good at user level? We introduce clusterwise LM
training, HeTLM (Heterogeneity aware Training of Language Model), appropriate
for subjective behaviors. We find that (i) a small LM trained using a
page-level tokenizer outperforms large pretrained or finetuned LMs; (ii) HeTLM
with heterogeneous cluster specific set of parameters outperforms a single LM
of the same family, controlling for the number of parameters; and (iii) a
higher mean and a lower variance in generation ensues, implying improved
alignment.

*Loris Schoenegger,Lukas Thoma,Terra Blevins,Benjamin Roth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究发现，使用基于模型训练影响的难度度量（训练数据影响力）进行课程学习，可以使语言模型预训练效果显著提升，在基准测试中比随机顺序训练高出10个百分点以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的课程学习在语言模型预训练中效果有限，主要原因是使用人为定义的难度度量（如文档复杂度）可能无法准确反映模型训练过程中的实际难度。

Method: 提出使用训练数据影响力作为难度度量，该分数估计单个训练样本对模型输出的影响程度，并按照此影响力对训练样本进行排序，从简单到复杂进行课程学习。

Result: 使用基于训练数据影响力的课程学习方法训练的模型，在基准测试中比随机顺序训练的模型性能高出10个百分点以上，证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 课程学习对语言模型预训练是有益的，但需要采用更符合模型训练特性的模型中心难度度量，而不是传统的人为中心难度度量。

Abstract: Curriculum learning, a training technique where data is presented to the
model in order of example difficulty (e.g., from simpler to more complex
documents), has shown limited success for pre-training language models. In this
work, we investigate whether curriculum learning becomes competitive if we
replace conventional human-centered difficulty metrics with one that more
closely corresponds to example difficulty as observed during model training.
Specifically, we experiment with sorting training examples by their
\textit{training data influence}, a score which estimates the effect of
individual training examples on the model's output. Models trained on our
curricula are able to outperform ones trained in random order by over 10
percentage points in benchmarks, confirming that curriculum learning is
beneficial for language model pre-training, as long as a more model-centric
notion of difficulty is adopted.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SLM-Bench是首个专门评估小型语言模型(SLMs)的基准测试，从准确性、计算效率和可持续性三个维度对15个SLM在9个NLP任务上进行综合评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏对小型语言模型性能和环境影响系统性评估的基准测试，需要开发一个全面的评估框架来填补这一空白。

Method: 在4种硬件配置下，使用23个数据集覆盖14个领域，通过11个指标从正确性、计算性能和能耗三个维度对15个SLM进行评估，并开发了开源基准测试管道。

Result: 评估结果显示不同SLM在准确性和能源效率方面存在显著权衡，部分模型在准确性方面表现优异，而其他模型在能源效率方面更胜一筹。

Conclusion: SLM-Bench为SLM评估设立了新标准，弥合了资源效率与实际应用之间的差距，为后续研究提供了可复现的标准化评估框架。

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) offer computational efficiency and
accessibility, yet a systematic evaluation of their performance and
environmental impact remains lacking. We introduce SLM-Bench, the first
benchmark specifically designed to assess SLMs across multiple dimensions,
including accuracy, computational efficiency, and sustainability metrics.
SLM-Bench evaluates 15 SLMs on 9 NLP tasks using 23 datasets spanning 14
domains. The evaluation is conducted on 4 hardware configurations, providing a
rigorous comparison of their effectiveness. Unlike prior benchmarks, SLM-Bench
quantifies 11 metrics across correctness, computation, and consumption,
enabling a holistic assessment of efficiency trade-offs. Our evaluation
considers controlled hardware conditions, ensuring fair comparisons across
models. We develop an open-source benchmarking pipeline with standardized
evaluation protocols to facilitate reproducibility and further research. Our
findings highlight the diverse trade-offs among SLMs, where some models excel
in accuracy while others achieve superior energy efficiency. SLM-Bench sets a
new standard for SLM evaluation, bridging the gap between resource efficiency
and real-world applicability.

TL;DR: HebID是首个希伯来语多标签社会身份检测语料库，包含5536个以色列政客Facebook帖子的句子，标注了12种细粒度社会身份，在希伯来语调优的大语言模型上达到最佳性能（F1=0.74）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有身份检测数据集主要是英语中心、单标签且关注粗粒度身份类别，缺乏对希伯来语等非英语政治语境中细粒度社会身份的研究。

Method: 构建包含5536个句子的希伯来语多标签语料库，基于调查数据手动标注12种社会身份，对比多标签/单标签编码器和2B-9B参数生成式LLM的性能。

Result: 希伯来语调优的LLM取得最佳效果（宏F1=0.74），应用分类器分析政客帖子和议会演讲中的身份表达差异、时间趋势、聚类模式和性别相关变化。

Conclusion: HebID为希伯来语社会身份研究提供了全面基础，可作为其他非英语政治语境类似研究的模型，实现了精英话语与公众身份优先级的比较。

Abstract: Political language is deeply intertwined with social identities. While social
identities are often shaped by specific cultural contexts and expressed through
particular uses of language, existing datasets for group and identity detection
are predominantly English-centric, single-label and focus on coarse identity
categories. We introduce HebID, the first multilabel Hebrew corpus for social
identity detection: 5,536 sentences from Israeli politicians' Facebook posts
(Dec 2018-Apr 2021), manually annotated for twelve nuanced social identities
(e.g. Rightist, Ultra-Orthodox, Socially-oriented) grounded by survey data. We
benchmark multilabel and single-label encoders alongside 2B-9B-parameter
generative LLMs, finding that Hebrew-tuned LLMs provide the best results
(macro-$F_1$ = 0.74). We apply our classifier to politicians' Facebook posts
and parliamentary speeches, evaluating differences in popularity, temporal
trends, clustering patterns, and gender-related variations in identity
expression. We utilize identity choices from a national public survey, enabling
a comparison between identities portrayed in elite discourse and the public's
identity priorities. HebID provides a comprehensive foundation for studying
social identities in Hebrew and can serve as a model for similar research in
other non-English political contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自回归模型需要顺序生成token，效率较低。研究者希望开发一种并行生成序列的扩散语言模型，提高生成效率并保持高质量输出。

Method: 采用离散扩散建模方法，通过迭代去噪并行精炼序列。使用自回归LLM初始化和上下文自适应的token级噪声重调度等简单有效的训练技术。

Result: 在通用任务、数学任务和编程任务上持续超越现有扩散语言模型，展现出优异的规划能力、任意顺序生成、填充能力和可调节的质量-速度权衡。

Conclusion: Dream 7B证明了扩散建模在语言生成任务中的有效性，为基于扩散的语言建模研究提供了新的基准和工具（Dream-Base和Dream-Instruct）。

Abstract: We introduce Dream 7B, the most powerful open diffusion large language model
to date. Unlike autoregressive (AR) models that generate tokens sequentially,
Dream 7B employs discrete diffusion modeling to refine sequences in parallel
through iterative denoising. Our model consistently outperforms existing
diffusion language models on general, mathematical, and coding tasks. Dream 7B
demonstrates superior planning abilities and inference flexibility, including
arbitrary-order generation, infilling capabilities, and tunable quality-speed
trade-offs. These results are achieved through simple yet effective training
techniques, including AR-based LLM initialization and context-adaptive
token-level noise rescheduling. We release both Dream-Base and Dream-Instruct
to facilitate further research in diffusion-based language modeling.

TL;DR: 首个大规模政治去合法化话语(PDD)计算研究，构建希伯来语语料库并开发两阶段分类模型，发现PDD在30年间显著增长，社交媒体比议会辩论更普遍，右翼政客使用更多。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究政治去合法化话语(PDD)作为对政治实体规范性有效性的象征性攻击，需要系统分析其在民主话语中的模式和影响。

Method: 构建包含10,410个句子的希伯来语语料库，来自议会演讲、Facebook帖子和新闻媒体；开发两阶段分类管道，结合微调编码器模型和解码器LLM。

Result: 最佳模型(DictaLM 2.0)在二元PDD检测上F1得分为0.74，在去合法化特征分类上宏F1为0.67；发现PDD在30年间显著增长，社交媒体比议会辩论更普遍，男性政客比女性使用更多，右翼行为者倾向更强。

Conclusion: 自动化PDD分析对于理解民主话语具有可行性和重要价值，特别是在选举活动和重大政治事件期间表现出明显峰值。

Abstract: We present the first large-scale computational study of political
delegitimization discourse (PDD), defined as symbolic attacks on the normative
validity of political entities. We curate and manually annotate a novel
Hebrew-language corpus of 10,410 sentences drawn from Knesset speeches
(1993-2023), Facebook posts (2018-2021), and leading news outlets, of which
1,812 instances (17.4\%) exhibit PDD and 642 carry additional annotations for
intensity, incivility, target type, and affective framing. We introduce a
two-stage classification pipeline combining finetuned encoder models and
decoder LLMs. Our best model (DictaLM 2.0) attains an F$_1$ of 0.74 for binary
PDD detection and a macro-F$_1$ of 0.67 for classification of delegitimization
characteristics. Applying this classifier to longitudinal and cross-platform
data, we see a marked rise in PDD over three decades, higher prevalence on
social media versus parliamentary debate, greater use by male than female
politicians, and stronger tendencies among right-leaning actors - with
pronounced spikes during election campaigns and major political events. Our
findings demonstrate the feasibility and value of automated PDD analysis for
understanding democratic discourse.

Method: 设计了首个以代理流程为基础的系统SafetyFlow，通过组织七个专门代理完全自动构建安全测试集，集成人类专业知识并确保过程和成本可控

Result: 构建了包含23,446条查询的SafetyFlowBench数据集，具有低冗余和强辨别力，对49个先进LLM进行了安全评估

Conclusion: SafetyFlow系统能够显著降低时间资源成本，构建质量高的安全测试集，为LLM安全评测提供了高效自动化解决方案

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has intensified the
requirement for reliable safety evaluation to uncover model vulnerabilities. To
this end, numerous LLM safety evaluation benchmarks are proposed. However,
existing benchmarks generally rely on labor-intensive manual curation, which
causes excessive time and resource consumption. They also exhibit significant
redundancy and limited difficulty. To alleviate these problems, we introduce
SafetyFlow, the first agent-flow system designed to automate the construction
of LLM safety benchmarks. SafetyFlow can automatically build a comprehensive
safety benchmark in only four days without any human intervention by
orchestrating seven specialized agents, significantly reducing time and
resource cost. Equipped with versatile tools, the agents of SafetyFlow ensure
process and cost controllability while integrating human expertise into the
automatic pipeline. The final constructed dataset, SafetyFlowBench, contains
23,446 queries with low redundancy and strong discriminative power. Our
contribution includes the first fully automated benchmarking pipeline and a
comprehensive safety benchmark. We evaluate the safety of 49 advanced LLMs on
our dataset and conduct extensive experiments to validate our efficacy and
efficiency.

TL;DR: SDGO是一个自判别引导的强化学习框架，利用LLM自身的判别能力作为奖励信号，通过迭代自改进来增强生成安全性，无需额外标注数据或外部模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现LLMs作为判别器识别有害请求的能力远强于作为生成器防御这些请求的能力，这种安全不一致性促使研究者探索对齐模型的判别和生成能力。

Method: 提出SDGO框架，使用模型自身的判别能力作为强化学习的奖励信号，通过迭代自改进过程来增强生成安全性，训练阶段不需要额外标注数据或外部模型。

Result: 实验表明SDGO显著提高了模型安全性，在保持通用基准上有用性的同时，对分布外越狱攻击表现出鲁棒性能，且只需少量判别样本就能进一步增强生成能力。

Conclusion: 通过对齐LLMs的判别和生成能力，SDGO实现了两种能力的紧密耦合，为提升模型安全性提供了一种有效且高效的方法，特别是在对抗越狱攻击方面表现出色。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at various natural language processing
tasks but remain vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks that induce harmful content
generation. In this paper, we reveal a critical safety inconsistency: LLMs can
more effectively identify harmful requests as discriminators than defend
against them as generators. This insight inspires us to explore aligning the
model's inherent discrimination and generation capabilities. To this end, we
propose SDGO (Self-Discrimination-Guided Optimization), a reinforcement
learning framework that leverages the model's own discrimination capabilities
as a reward signal to enhance generation safety through iterative
self-improvement. Our method does not require any additional annotated data or
external models during the training phase. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that SDGO significantly improves model safety compared to both prompt-based and
training-based baselines while maintaining helpfulness on general benchmarks.
By aligning LLMs' discrimination and generation capabilities, SDGO brings
robust performance against out-of-distribution (OOD) jailbreaking attacks. This
alignment achieves tighter coupling between these two capabilities, enabling
the model's generation capability to be further enhanced with only a small
amount of discriminative samples. Our code and datasets are available at
https://github.com/NJUNLP/SDGO.

Method: 构建SurGE基准，包括主题描述、专家撰写的综述及其引用文献的测试实例集，以及超过百万篇论文的学术语料库；提出自动化评估框架，从信息覆盖度、引用准确性、结构组织和内容质量四个维度评估生成综述。

Result: 对多种基于LLM的方法评估表明，即使使用先进的自反思框架，科学综述生成任务仍然极具挑战性。

Conclusion: 科学综述生成任务复杂度高，需要持续研究，SurGE基准为相关研究提供了标准化评估基础。

Abstract: Scientific survey articles play a vital role in summarizing research
progress, yet their manual creation is becoming increasingly infeasible due to
the rapid growth of academic literature. While large language models (LLMs)
offer promising capabilities for automating this process, progress in this area
is hindered by the absence of standardized benchmarks and evaluation protocols.
To address this gap, we introduce SurGE (Survey Generation Evaluation), a new
benchmark for evaluating scientific survey generation in the computer science
domain. SurGE consists of (1) a collection of test instances, each including a
topic description, an expert-written survey, and its full set of cited
references, and (2) a large-scale academic corpus of over one million papers
that serves as the retrieval pool. In addition, we propose an automated
evaluation framework that measures generated surveys across four dimensions:
information coverage, referencing accuracy, structural organization, and
content quality. Our evaluation of diverse LLM-based approaches shows that
survey generation remains highly challenging, even for advanced self-reflection
frameworks. These findings highlight the complexity of the task and the
necessity for continued research. We have open-sourced all the code, data, and
models at: https://github.com/oneal2000/SurGE

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 位置偏差（PB）表现为不同上下文位置的非均匀敏感性，严重损害长上下文理解能力。现有方法通过修改架构来缓解PB，但显著的位置偏差仍然存在。

Method: 提出了Pos2Distill框架，利用位置引起的固有差异来抵消位置偏差本身。针对检索和推理范式设计了两个专门实例：Pos2Distill-R¹和Pos2Distill-R²，通过知识蒸馏将优势位置的能力转移到劣势位置。

Result: 使用Pos2Distill方法在所有上下文位置实现了增强的均匀性和显著的性能增益，在长上下文检索和推理任务中均表现出色。两个专门系统展现出强大的跨任务泛化能力。

Conclusion: Pos2Distill框架有效缓解了位置偏差问题，通过知识蒸馏机制实现了位置间能力的均衡转移，在长上下文处理任务中取得了优异性能。

Abstract: Positional bias (PB), manifesting as non-uniform sensitivity across different
contextual locations, significantly impairs long-context comprehension and
processing capabilities. While prior work seeks to mitigate PB through
modifying the architectures causing its emergence, significant PB still
persists. To address PB effectively, we introduce \textbf{Pos2Distill}, a
position to position knowledge distillation framework. Pos2Distill transfers
the superior capabilities from advantageous positions to less favorable ones,
thereby reducing the huge performance gaps. The conceptual principle is to
leverage the inherent, position-induced disparity to counteract the PB itself.
We identify distinct manifestations of PB under \textbf{\textsc{r}}etrieval and
\textbf{\textsc{r}}easoning paradigms, thereby designing two specialized
instantiations: \emph{Pos2Distill-R\textsuperscript{1}} and
\emph{Pos2Distill-R\textsuperscript{2}} respectively, both grounded in this
core principle. By employing the Pos2Distill approach, we achieve enhanced
uniformity and significant performance gains across all contextual positions in
long-context retrieval and reasoning tasks. Crucially, both specialized systems
exhibit strong cross-task generalization mutually, while achieving superior
performance on their respective tasks.

Conclusion: 建议为孜加拉语开发健壁的词干提取器，并建议继续进行深入研究以提升语言分析和处理能力。

Abstract: Bangla, the seventh most widely spoken language worldwide with 300 million
native speakers, faces digital under-representation due to limited resources
and lack of annotated datasets. Stemming, a critical preprocessing step in
language analysis, is essential for low-resource, highly-inflectional languages
like Bangla, because it can reduce the complexity of algorithms and models by
significantly reducing the number of words the algorithm needs to consider.
This paper conducts a comprehensive survey of stemming approaches, emphasizing
the importance of handling morphological variants effectively. While exploring
the landscape of Bangla stemming, it becomes evident that there is a
significant gap in the existing literature. The paper highlights the
discontinuity from previous research and the scarcity of accessible
implementations for replication. Furthermore, it critiques the evaluation
methodologies, stressing the need for more relevant metrics. In the context of
Bangla's rich morphology and diverse dialects, the paper acknowledges the
challenges it poses. To address these challenges, the paper suggests directions
for Bangla stemmer development. It concludes by advocating for robust Bangla
stemmers and continued research in the field to enhance language analysis and
processing.

Motivation: 电商平台拥有丰富的多模态数据，但现有数据集在规模和设计上有限，难以系统研究图像是否真正增强产品理解，还是可能引入冗余或降低性能

Method: 构建EcomMMMU数据集（406,190样本，8,989,510图像），包含8个核心任务和VSS子集；提出SUMEI方法，通过预测视觉效用来策略性使用多图像进行下游任务

Result: 分析发现产品图像并不总是提升性能，有时反而会降低表现，表明MLLMs在有效利用丰富视觉内容进行电商任务方面存在困难

Conclusion: SUMEI方法通过数据驱动的方式策略性利用多图像，实验证明其有效性和鲁棒性，为电商多模态理解提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: E-commerce platforms are rich in multimodal data, featuring a variety of
images that depict product details. However, this raises an important question:
do these images always enhance product understanding, or can they sometimes
introduce redundancy or degrade performance? Existing datasets are limited in
both scale and design, making it difficult to systematically examine this
question. To this end, we introduce EcomMMMU, an e-commerce multimodal
multitask understanding dataset with 406,190 samples and 8,989,510 images.
EcomMMMU is comprised of multi-image visual-language data designed with 8
essential tasks and a specialized VSS subset to benchmark the capability of
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to effectively utilize visual content.
Analysis on EcomMMMU reveals that product images do not consistently improve
performance and can, in some cases, degrade it. This indicates that MLLMs may
struggle to effectively leverage rich visual content for e-commerce tasks.
Building on these insights, we propose SUMEI, a data-driven method that
strategically utilizes multiple images via predicting visual utilities before
using them for downstream tasks. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of SUMEI. The data and code are available through
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/submission25.

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis with medical large language models is hindered by
knowledge gaps and hallucinations. Retrieval and tool-augmented methods help,
but their impact is limited by weak use of external knowledge and poor
feedback-reasoning traceability. To address these challenges, We introduce
Deep-DxSearch, an agentic RAG system trained end-to-end with reinforcement
learning (RL) that enables steer tracebale retrieval-augmented reasoning for
medical diagnosis. In Deep-DxSearch, we first construct a large-scale medical
retrieval corpus comprising patient records and reliable medical knowledge
sources to support retrieval-aware reasoning across diagnostic scenarios. More
crutially, we frame the LLM as the core agent and the retrieval corpus as its
environment, using tailored rewards on format, retrieval, reasoning structure,
and diagnostic accuracy, thereby evolving the agentic RAG policy from
large-scale data through RL.
  Experiments demonstrate that our end-to-end agentic RL training framework
consistently outperforms prompt-engineering and training-free RAG approaches
across multiple data centers. After training, Deep-DxSearch achieves
substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing strong diagnostic
baselines such as GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and other medical-specific frameworks
for both common and rare disease diagnosis under in-distribution and
out-of-distribution settings. Moreover, ablation studies on reward design and
retrieval corpus components confirm their critical roles, underscoring the
uniqueness and effectiveness of our approach compared with traditional
implementations. Finally, case studies and interpretability analyses highlight
improvements in Deep-DxSearch's diagnostic policy, providing deeper insight
into its performance gains and supporting clinicians in delivering more
reliable and precise preliminary diagnoses. See

### [120] [Dissecting Tool-Integrated Reasoning: An Empirical Study and Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15754)
*Yufeng Zhao,Junnan Liu,Hongwei Liu,Dongsheng Zhu,Yuan Shen,Songyang Zhang,Kai Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReasonZoo基准测试显示，工具集成推理(TIR)能显著提升大语言模型在数学和非数学推理任务中的性能，并通过新指标PAC和AUC-PCC证明TIR提高了推理效率，减少了过度思考。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在推理任务上取得进展，但在精确计算方面仍有不足。工具集成推理(TIR)被提出作为解决方案，但其泛化效果和对模型推理行为的改善尚不明确。

Method: 引入ReasonZoo基准测试，涵盖9个不同推理类别，并提出两个新指标：性能感知成本(PAC)和性能-成本曲线下面积(AUC-PCC)来评估推理效率。

Result: 实证评估表明，启用TIR的模型在数学和非数学任务中均优于非TIR模型，TIR提高了推理效率，减少了过度思考，使推理更加精简。

Conclusion: TIR具有领域通用的优势，有潜力提升大语言模型在复杂推理任务中的能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in reasoning tasks
through methods like chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. However, they often fall
short in tasks requiring precise computations. Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR)
has emerged as a solution by incorporating external tools into the reasoning
process. Nevertheless, the generalization of TIR in improving the reasoning
ability of LLM is still unclear. Additionally, whether TIR has improved the
model's reasoning behavior and helped the model think remains to be studied. We
introduce ReasonZoo, a comprehensive benchmark encompassing nine diverse
reasoning categories, to evaluate the effectiveness of TIR across various
domains. Additionally, we propose two novel metrics, Performance-Aware Cost
(PAC) and Area Under the Performance-Cost Curve (AUC-PCC), to assess reasoning
efficiency. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that TIR-enabled models
consistently outperform their non-TIR counterparts in both mathematical and
non-mathematical tasks. Furthermore, TIR enhances reasoning efficiency, as
evidenced by improved PAC and AUC-PCC, indicating reduced overthinking and more
streamlined reasoning. These findings underscore the domain-general benefits of
TIR and its potential to advance LLM capabilities in complex reasoning tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LiveMCP-101是一个包含101个真实世界查询的基准测试，用于评估AI代理在多步骤任务中使用多种MCP工具的能力，实验显示即使前沿LLM的成功率也低于60%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然MCP为工具集成提供了标准化框架，但缺乏在真实动态场景中评估AI代理使用多样化MCP工具解决多步骤任务能力的基准测试。

Method: 通过迭代LLM重写和人工评审精心策划101个真实查询，引入基于真实执行计划而非原始API输出的新颖评估方法，更好地反映真实环境的动态特性。

Result: 实验表明即使最先进的LLM成功率也低于60%，详细消融和错误分析揭示了工具协调中的主要挑战、不同的失败模式以及token使用效率问题。

Conclusion: LiveMCP-101为评估真实世界代理能力设定了严格标准，指出了推进当前模型的具体方向，推动通过工具使用可靠执行复杂任务的自主AI系统发展。

Abstract: Tool calling has emerged as a critical capability for AI agents to interact
with the real world and solve complex tasks. While the Model Context Protocol
(MCP) provides a powerful standardized framework for tool integration, there is
a significant gap in benchmarking how well AI agents can effectively solve
multi-step tasks using diverse MCP tools in realistic, dynamic scenarios. In
this work, we present LiveMCP-101, a benchmark of 101 carefully curated
real-world queries, refined through iterative LLM rewriting and manual review,
that require coordinated use of multiple MCP tools including web search, file
operations, mathematical reasoning, and data analysis. Moreover, we introduce a
novel evaluation approach that leverages ground-truth execution plans rather
than raw API outputs, better reflecting the evolving nature of real-world
environments. Experiments show that even frontier LLMs achieve a success rate
below 60\%, highlighting major challenges in tool orchestration. Detailed
ablations and error analysis further reveal distinct failure modes and
inefficiencies in token usage, pointing to concrete directions for advancing
current models. LiveMCP-101 sets a rigorous standard for evaluating real-world
agent capabilities, advancing toward autonomous AI systems that reliably
execute complex tasks through tool use.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 一种基于图像分割和各向异性扩散的混合现实场景重照明方法，能够在边缘设备上实现高达100fps的实时性能，解决了现有深度学习方法计算复杂和场景扫描不准确的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习基于的重照明技术计算复杂超出MR设备实时性能力，而场景理解方法因扫描限制导致结果不准确，2D图像筛波方法又无法表示复杂几何和阴影。

Method: 结合图像分割、基础场景理解和各向异性扩散光照传播，使用筛波技术的计算简单性，美化设备扫描的不准确性。

Result: 在边缘设备上实现了高达100fps的实时性能，产生视觉吸引人且准确的重照明效果，通过与行业标准的直接对比验证了效果。

Conclusion: 该方法成功结合了不同技术的优势，解决了混合现实场景重照明的性能和质量挑战，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Mixed Reality scene relighting, where virtual changes to lighting conditions
realistically interact with physical objects, producing authentic illumination
and shadows, can be used in a variety of applications. One such application in
real estate could be visualizing a room at different times of day and placing
virtual light fixtures. Existing deep learning-based relighting techniques
typically exceed the real-time performance capabilities of current MR devices.
On the other hand, scene understanding methods, such as on-device scene
reconstruction, often yield inaccurate results due to scanning limitations, in
turn affecting relighting quality. Finally, simpler 2D image filter-based
approaches cannot represent complex geometry and shadows. We introduce a novel
method to integrate image segmentation, with lighting propagation via
anisotropic diffusion on top of basic scene understanding, and the
computational simplicity of filter-based techniques. Our approach corrects
on-device scanning inaccuracies, delivering visually appealing and accurate
relighting effects in real-time on edge devices, achieving speeds as high as
100 fps. We show a direct comparison between our method and the industry
standard, and present a practical demonstration of our method in the
aforementioned real estate example.

TL;DR: DeCoDi是一种针对文本到图像扩散模型的去偏方法，通过改变推理过程避免潜在维度中的偏见概念区域，无需复杂干预或显著计算开销


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度学习去偏方法通常需要复杂或计算密集的干预，而DeCoDi旨在仅改变推理过程，使其更易于广泛应用

Method: 改变扩散过程以避免潜在维度中偏见概念的区域，该方法可应用于任何基于扩散的图像生成模型

Result: 在护士、消防员和CEO等概念上成功去除了性别、种族和年龄偏见，人工评估1200张图像显示方法有效，GPT4o自动评估与人工评估结果一致

Conclusion: DeCoDi方法有潜力显著提高基于扩散的文本到图像生成模型生成图像的多样性，评估结果显示评估者间一致性可靠且保护属性覆盖更全面

Abstract: We propose DeCoDi, a debiasing procedure for text-to-image diffusion-based
models that changes the inference procedure, does not significantly change
image quality, has negligible compute overhead, and can be applied in any
diffusion-based image generation model. DeCoDi changes the diffusion process to
avoid latent dimension regions of biased concepts. While most deep learning
debiasing methods require complex or compute-intensive interventions, our
method is designed to change only the inference procedure. Therefore, it is
more accessible to a wide range of practitioners. We show the effectiveness of
the method by debiasing for gender, ethnicity, and age for the concepts of
nurse, firefighter, and CEO. Two distinct human evaluators manually inspect
1,200 generated images. Their evaluation results provide evidence that our
method is effective in mitigating biases based on gender, ethnicity, and age.
We also show that an automatic bias evaluation performed by the GPT4o is not
significantly statistically distinct from a human evaluation. Our evaluation
shows promising results, with reliable levels of agreement between evaluators
and more coverage of protected attributes. Our method has the potential to
significantly improve the diversity of images it generates by diffusion-based
text-to-image generative models.

*Yibo Liu,Liam Shatzel,Brandon Haworth,Teseo Schneider*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 基于大语言模型的群体动画方法，通过对话系统和语言驱动导航来实现更现实的群体模拟和社交行为


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有群体动画方法主要依赖导航和固定目标推断，缺乏语言和社交交互维度，导致代理人之间的交互限制于基本的导航行为

Method: 构建包含对话系统和语言驱动导航的方法：通过周期性查询代理人中心的LLMs，根据角色性格、角色、渴望和关系来生成对话；然后利用对话内容、个性、情感状态、视觉和物理状态来控制导航和行进

Result: 在复杂场景中验证方法有效，观察到代理人自动进行分组和解散，方法作为群体内信息传递机制，产生了更现实的群体模拟和涉溢出的组织行为

Conclusion: 该框架能够在任何环境设置中自然产生更现实的群体模拟和涉溢的组织行为，通过语言驱动的方式完善了代理人的移动决策机制

Abstract: Animating and simulating crowds using an agent-based approach is a
well-established area where every agent in the crowd is individually controlled
such that global human-like behaviour emerges. We observe that human navigation
and movement in crowds are often influenced by complex social and environmental
interactions, driven mainly by language and dialogue. However, most existing
work does not consider these dimensions and leads to animations where
agent-agent and agent-environment interactions are largely limited to steering
and fixed higher-level goal extrapolation.
  We propose a novel method that exploits large language models (LLMs) to
control agents' movement. Our method has two main components: a dialogue system
and language-driven navigation. We periodically query agent-centric LLMs
conditioned on character personalities, roles, desires, and relationships to
control the generation of inter-agent dialogue when necessitated by the spatial
and social relationships with neighbouring agents. We then use the conversation
and each agent's personality, emotional state, vision, and physical state to
control the navigation and steering of each agent. Our model thus enables
agents to make motion decisions based on both their perceptual inputs and the
ongoing dialogue.
  We validate our method in two complex scenarios that exemplify the interplay
between social interactions, steering, and crowding. In these scenarios, we
observe that grouping and ungrouping of agents automatically occur.
Additionally, our experiments show that our method serves as an
information-passing mechanism within the crowd. As a result, our framework
produces more realistic crowd simulations, with emergent group behaviours
arising naturally from any environmental setting.

### [125] [A Fully Spectral Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning Architecture with Graph Signal Processing as the Computational Backbone](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14923)
*Andrew Kiruluta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种完全基于频谱的神经符号推理架构，使用图信号处理(GSP)作为主要计算框架，将符号逻辑和神经推理在频谱域中统一处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推理模型仅将频谱图方法作为外围组件，而本文旨在构建一个完整的频谱域推理管道，实现更好的逻辑一致性和可解释性。

Method: 将逻辑实体和关系编码为图信号，通过可学习的频谱滤波器控制多尺度信息传播，并映射到符号谓词进行基于规则的推理。包括图傅里叶变换、频带选择性注意力和频谱规则落地等数学框架。

Result: 在ProofWriter、EntailmentBank、bAbI、CLUTRR和ARC-Challenge等基准推理数据集上，相比最先进的神经符号模型，在逻辑一致性、可解释性和计算效率方面都有提升。

Conclusion: 图信号处理为构建鲁棒且可解释的推理系统提供了数学基础扎实且计算效率高的计算基底。

Abstract: We propose a fully spectral, neuro\-symbolic reasoning architecture that
leverages Graph Signal Processing (GSP) as the primary computational backbone
for integrating symbolic logic and neural inference. Unlike conventional
reasoning models that treat spectral graph methods as peripheral components,
our approach formulates the entire reasoning pipeline in the graph spectral
domain. Logical entities and relationships are encoded as graph signals,
processed via learnable spectral filters that control multi-scale information
propagation, and mapped into symbolic predicates for rule-based inference. We
present a complete mathematical framework for spectral reasoning, including
graph Fourier transforms, band-selective attention, and spectral rule
grounding. Experiments on benchmark reasoning datasets (ProofWriter,
EntailmentBank, bAbI, CLUTRR, and ARC-Challenge) demonstrate improvements in
logical consistency, interpretability, and computational efficiency over
state\-of\-the\-art neuro\-symbolic models. Our results suggest that GSP
provides a mathematically grounded and computationally efficient substrate for
robust and interpretable reasoning systems.

*Nadav Amir,Stas Tiomkin,Angela Langdon*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于佛教认识论的目标导向状态表示计算框架，描述性和规范性世界模型方面从智能体-环境交互中协同涌现，而非传统强化学习中的分离组件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统计算模型（如强化学习）将世界模型分为状态表示（描述性）和奖励函数（规范性）两个独立组件，但本文探索这两种方面从智能体目标中协同涌现的替代可能性。

Method: 引入目标导向（telic）状态概念，定义为目标等价经验分布的类别，通过行为策略与期望经验特征之间的统计差异来提供目标导向学习的简约解释。

Result: 提出了一个统一的计算框架，能够解释行为、现象学和神经维度上的目的性行为，支持描述性和规范性世界模型方面的协同涌现理论。

Conclusion: 该框架为跨不同基质的目的性行为提供了统一解释，挑战了传统世界模型组件的分离假设，强调从经验中协同涌现的重要性。

Abstract: Purposeful behavior is a hallmark of natural and artificial intelligence. Its
acquisition is often believed to rely on world models, comprising both
descriptive (what is) and prescriptive (what is desirable) aspects that
identify and evaluate state of affairs in the world, respectively. Canonical
computational accounts of purposeful behavior, such as reinforcement learning,
posit distinct components of a world model comprising a state representation
(descriptive aspect) and a reward function (prescriptive aspect). However, an
alternative possibility, which has not yet been computationally formulated, is
that these two aspects instead co-emerge interdependently from an agent's goal.
Here, we describe a computational framework of goal-directed state
representation in cognitive agents, in which the descriptive and prescriptive
aspects of a world model co-emerge from agent-environment interaction
sequences, or experiences. Drawing on Buddhist epistemology, we introduce a
construct of goal-directed, or telic, states, defined as classes of
goal-equivalent experience distributions. Telic states provide a parsimonious
account of goal-directed learning in terms of the statistical divergence
between behavioral policies and desirable experience features. We review
empirical and theoretical literature supporting this novel perspective and
discuss its potential to provide a unified account of behavioral,
phenomenological and neural dimensions of purposeful behaviors across diverse
substrates.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Collab-REC是一个多智能体框架，通过三个LLM智能体（个性化、流行度、可持续性）从不同角度生成旅游推荐，再通过非LLM调解器进行多轮协商整合，有效提升推荐多样性和平衡性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决旅游推荐系统中的流行度偏见问题，避免过度旅游，提升推荐多样性，让更多被忽视的旅游地点得到关注

Method: 使用三个基于LLM的智能体分别从个性化、流行度和可持续性角度生成城市推荐建议，然后通过非LLM调解器进行多轮协商和整合，惩罚重复或无意义的响应

Result: 在欧洲城市查询实验中，Collab-REC相比单智能体基线提高了推荐多样性和整体相关性，能够推荐更多被忽视的旅游地点

Conclusion: 多利益相关者协作的LLM驱动推荐系统具有很大潜力，能够提供更平衡、情境感知的推荐，更好地满足用户约束条件

Abstract: We propose Collab-REC, a multi-agent framework designed to counteract
popularity bias and enhance diversity in tourism recommendations. In our
setting, three LLM-based agents -- Personalization, Popularity, and
Sustainability generate city suggestions from complementary perspectives. A
non-LLM moderator then merges and refines these proposals via multi-round
negotiation, ensuring each agent's viewpoint is incorporated while penalizing
spurious or repeated responses. Experiments on European city queries show that
Collab-REC improves diversity and overall relevance compared to a single-agent
baseline, surfacing lesser-visited locales that often remain overlooked. This
balanced, context-aware approach addresses over-tourism and better aligns with
constraints provided by the user, highlighting the promise of multi-stakeholder
collaboration in LLM-driven recommender systems.

*Romain Lacombe,Kerrie Wu,Eddie Dilworth*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 大型语言模型在问答任务中需要稳健的置信度校准。研究发现增加推理预算反而损害校准效果，导致系统性过度自信，而检索增强生成显著优于纯推理方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型在置信度评估方面的准确性，特别关注推理能力和计算预算对校准效果的影响，挑战现有的"测试时扩展"范式。

Method: 使用ClimateX数据集并扩展到人类和行星健康领域，系统评估不同推理预算下LLM的置信度评估准确性，比较纯推理与检索增强生成方法。

Result: 推理型LLM在专家置信度评估中达到48.7%准确率，但增加推理预算会损害校准效果；检索增强生成方法达到89.3%的准确率，显著优于纯推理。

Conclusion: 信息获取而非推理深度或推理预算，可能是知识密集型任务中改进置信度校准的关键瓶颈。

Abstract: Large Language Models deployed as question answering tools require robust
calibration to avoid overconfidence. We systematically evaluate how reasoning
capabilities and budget affect confidence assessment accuracy, using the
ClimateX dataset (Lacombe et al., 2023) and expanding it to human and planetary
health. Our key finding challenges the "test-time scaling" paradigm: while
recent reasoning LLMs achieve 48.7% accuracy in assessing expert confidence,
increasing reasoning budgets consistently impairs rather than improves
calibration. Extended reasoning leads to systematic overconfidence that worsens
with longer thinking budgets, producing diminishing and negative returns beyond
modest computational investments. Conversely, search-augmented generation
dramatically outperforms pure reasoning, achieving 89.3% accuracy by retrieving
relevant evidence. Our results suggest that information access, rather than
reasoning depth or inference budget, may be the critical bottleneck for
improved confidence calibration of knowledge-intensive tasks.

TL;DR: S3LoRA是一个轻量级、无需数据、模型无关的框架，通过分析LoRA微调的权重更新来缓解安全风险，使用MAS-SVD方法分析结构特性并通过SSI指标检测和修剪潜在不安全的层。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型使用LoRA等参数高效微调技术进行适配时，可能会无意中损害安全对齐，导致不安全或不稳定的行为。现有方法通常需要访问基础模型和指令微调模型检查点，这在实践中往往不可用。

Method: 提出S3LoRA框架：1) 引入MAS-SVD方法分析LoRA更新的结构特性；2) 设计SSI指标检测具有高度集中和潜在不安全更新的层；3) 对这些层进行后修剪以减少风险。

Result: 在智能体规划和语言生成任务上的广泛实验表明，S3LoRA持续改善安全指标，同时保持或改善效用指标，并显著降低推理成本。

Conclusion: S3LoRA为在现实世界、资源受限和安全关键环境中安全部署基于LLM的智能体提供了一个实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) using parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) techniques such as LoRA has enabled powerful capabilities in LLM-based
agents. However, these adaptations can unintentionally compromise safety
alignment, leading to unsafe or unstable behaviors, particularly in agent
planning tasks. Existing safety-aware adaptation methods often require access
to both base and instruction-tuned model checkpoints, which are frequently
unavailable in practice, limiting their applicability. We propose S3LoRA (Safe
Spectral Sharpness-Guided Pruning LoRA), a lightweight, data-free, and
model-independent framework that mitigates safety risks in LoRA-adapted models
by inspecting only the fine-tuned weight updates. We first introduce
Magnitude-Aware Spherically Normalized SVD (MAS-SVD), which robustly analyzes
the structural properties of LoRA updates while preserving global magnitude
information. We then design the Spectral Sharpness Index (SSI), a
sharpness-aware metric to detect layers with highly concentrated and
potentially unsafe updates. These layers are pruned post-hoc to reduce risk
without sacrificing task performance. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies across agent planning and language generation tasks show that S3LoRA
consistently improves safety metrics while maintaining or improving utility
metrics and significantly reducing inference cost. These results establish
S3LoRA as a practical and scalable solution for safely deploying LLM-based
agents in real-world, resource-constrained, and safety-critical environments.

Conclusion: GOOD方法能够有效地处理开放式目标推理问题，提供了丰富的目标表征和不确定性估计，而且数据效率高。

Abstract: Embodied AI agents must infer and act in an interpretable way on diverse
human goals and preferences that are not predefined. To formalize this setting,
we introduce Open-Universe Assistance Games (OU-AGs), a framework where the
agent must reason over an unbounded and evolving space of possible goals. In
this context, we introduce GOOD (GOals from Open-ended Dialogue), a
data-efficient, online method that extracts goals in the form of natural
language during an interaction with a human, and infers a distribution over
natural language goals. GOOD prompts an LLM to simulate users with different
complex intents, using its responses to perform probabilistic inference over
candidate goals. This approach enables rich goal representations and
uncertainty estimation without requiring large offline datasets. We evaluate
GOOD in a text-based grocery shopping domain and in a text-operated simulated
household robotics environment (AI2Thor), using synthetic user profiles. Our
method outperforms a baseline without explicit goal tracking, as confirmed by
both LLM-based and human evaluations.

Conclusion: aiXiv为AI科学家建立了新一代开放获取生态系统的基础，加速了高质量AI生成研究内容的发表和传播。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled AI agents to
autonomously generate scientific proposals, conduct experiments, author papers,
and perform peer reviews. Yet this flood of AI-generated research content
collides with a fragmented and largely closed publication ecosystem.
Traditional journals and conferences rely on human peer review, making them
difficult to scale and often reluctant to accept AI-generated research content;
existing preprint servers (e.g. arXiv) lack rigorous quality-control
mechanisms. Consequently, a significant amount of high-quality AI-generated
research lacks appropriate venues for dissemination, hindering its potential to
advance scientific progress. To address these challenges, we introduce aiXiv, a
next-generation open-access platform for human and AI scientists. Its
multi-agent architecture allows research proposals and papers to be submitted,
reviewed, and iteratively refined by both human and AI scientists. It also
provides API and MCP interfaces that enable seamless integration of
heterogeneous human and AI scientists, creating a scalable and extensible
ecosystem for autonomous scientific discovery. Through extensive experiments,
we demonstrate that aiXiv is a reliable and robust platform that significantly
enhances the quality of AI-generated research proposals and papers after
iterative revising and reviewing on aiXiv. Our work lays the groundwork for a
next-generation open-access ecosystem for AI scientists, accelerating the
publication and dissemination of high-quality AI-generated research content.

Conclusion: GUI-Owl和Mobile-Agent-v3通过创新的基础设施、多样化能力和强化学习框架，显著提升了GUI代理模型的性能，为GUI自动化任务提供了强大的开源解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces GUI-Owl, a foundational GUI agent model that achieves
state-of-the-art performance among open-source end-to-end models on ten GUI
benchmarks across desktop and mobile environments, covering grounding, question
answering, planning, decision-making, and procedural knowledge. GUI-Owl-7B
achieves 66.4 on AndroidWorld and 29.4 on OSWorld. Building on this, we propose
Mobile-Agent-v3, a general-purpose GUI agent framework that further improves
performance to 73.3 on AndroidWorld and 37.7 on OSWorld, setting a new
state-of-the-art for open-source GUI agent frameworks. GUI-Owl incorporates
three key innovations: (1) Large-scale Environment Infrastructure: a
cloud-based virtual environment spanning Android, Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows,
enabling our Self-Evolving GUI Trajectory Production framework. This generates
high-quality interaction data via automated query generation and correctness
validation, leveraging GUI-Owl to refine trajectories iteratively, forming a
self-improving loop. It supports diverse data pipelines and reduces manual
annotation. (2) Diverse Foundational Agent Capabilities: by integrating UI
grounding, planning, action semantics, and reasoning patterns, GUI-Owl supports
end-to-end decision-making and can act as a modular component in multi-agent
systems. (3) Scalable Environment RL: we develop a scalable reinforcement
learning framework with fully asynchronous training for real-world alignment.
We also introduce Trajectory-aware Relative Policy Optimization (TRPO) for
online RL, achieving 34.9 on OSWorld. GUI-Owl and Mobile-Agent-v3 are

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PuzzleClone是一个使用SMT理论的可验证数学逻辑数据集生成框架，通过编码种子谜题、随机化变量和约束来大规模生成多样化数据，显著提升了LLM的逻辑推理能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM生成的数学逻辑数据集存在可靠性、多样性和可扩展性不足的问题，需要高质量可验证的数据来增强大语言模型的推理能力

Method: 基于Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT)的正式框架，包含三个创新：编码种子谜题为结构化逻辑规范、通过变量和约束随机化生成可扩展变体、通过重现机制确保有效性

Result: 构建了包含83K+多样化程序验证谜题的基准测试集，在PuzzleClone测试集上平均准确率从14.4提升到56.2，在7个逻辑数学基准上实现最高12.5个百分点的绝对提升

Conclusion: PuzzleClone框架能够大规模生成高质量可验证的数学逻辑数据，显著提升LLM的逻辑推理能力，为增强模型推理性能提供了有效的数据生成解决方案

Abstract: High-quality mathematical and logical datasets with verifiable answers are
essential for strengthening the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs). While recent data augmentation techniques have facilitated the creation
of large-scale benchmarks, existing LLM-generated datasets often suffer from
limited reliability, diversity, and scalability. To address these challenges,
we introduce PuzzleClone, a formal framework for synthesizing verifiable data
at scale using Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT). Our approach features
three key innovations: (1) encoding seed puzzles into structured logical
specifications, (2) generating scalable variants through systematic variable
and constraint randomization, and (3) ensuring validity via a reproduction
mechanism. Applying PuzzleClone, we construct a curated benchmark comprising
over 83K diverse and programmatically validated puzzles. The generated puzzles
span a wide spectrum of difficulty and formats, posing significant challenges
to current state-of-the-art models. We conduct post training (SFT and RL) on
PuzzleClone datasets. Experimental results show that training on PuzzleClone
yields substantial improvements not only on PuzzleClone testset but also on
logic and mathematical benchmarks. Post training raises PuzzleClone average
from 14.4 to 56.2 and delivers consistent improvements across 7 logic and
mathematical benchmarks up to 12.5 absolute percentage points (AMC2023 from
52.5 to 65.0). Our code and data are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在罕见医疗疾病应用中面临数据稀缺和不可靠的挑战，多汗症影响2-3%人口但缺乏专门的AI支持系统。

Method: 三阶段流程：1)使用前沿LLM生成医学可信的合成数据；2)在开源基础模型上进行微调；3)临床和心理专家评估准确性、适当性和共情性。

Result: LLM4Sweat在基准测试中表现优于基线模型，成为首个针对多汗症的开源LLM框架，为其他罕见疾病提供了可推广的方法。

Conclusion: 该研究成功解决了罕见疾病数据稀缺问题，通过合成数据生成和专家验证的迭代流程，为罕见疾病的可信赖AI医疗支持提供了可行方案。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in healthcare, their
application for rare medical conditions is still hindered by scarce and
unreliable datasets for fine-tuning. Hyperhidrosis, a disorder causing
excessive sweating beyond physiological needs, is one such rare disorder,
affecting 2-3% of the population and significantly impacting both physical
comfort and psychosocial well-being. To date, no work has tailored LLMs to
advance the diagnosis or care of hyperhidrosis. To address this gap, we present
LLM4Sweat, an open-source and domain-specific LLM framework for trustworthy and
empathetic hyperhidrosis support. The system follows a three-stage pipeline. In
the data augmentation stage, a frontier LLM generates medically plausible
synthetic vignettes from curated open-source data to create a diverse and
balanced question-answer dataset. In the fine-tuning stage, an open-source
foundation model is fine-tuned on the dataset to provide diagnosis,
personalized treatment recommendations, and empathetic psychological support.
In the inference and expert evaluation stage, clinical and psychological
specialists assess accuracy, appropriateness, and empathy, with validated
responses iteratively enriching the dataset. Experiments show that LLM4Sweat
outperforms baselines and delivers the first open-source LLM framework for
hyperhidrosis, offering a generalizable approach for other rare diseases with
similar data and trustworthiness challenges.

*Raj Jain,Marc Wetter*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: R-ConstraintBench是一个评估大语言模型在资源约束项目调度问题中推理能力的框架，通过逐步增加约束复杂度来测试模型性能，发现模型在约束交互时性能急剧下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在严格资源、时间和操作约束下的推理可靠性尚未充分研究，需要系统评估模型在高约束环境下的表现。

Method: 开发R-ConstraintBench框架，通过在有向无环图中逐步增加非冗余优先约束，然后引入停机时间、时间窗口和分离约束，在数据中心迁移场景中实例化基准测试。

Result: 强模型在仅有优先约束的DAG上表现接近上限，但当停机时间、时间窗口和分离约束相互作用时，可行性性能崩溃，约束交互是主要瓶颈而非图深度。

Conclusion: 模型在干净合成数据上的表现不能保证在领域实际场景中的迁移，表明泛化能力有限，约束交互是当前LLM推理的主要挑战。

Abstract: Effective scheduling under tight resource, timing, and operational
constraints underpins large-scale planning across sectors such as capital
projects, manufacturing, logistics, and IT fleet transitions. However, the
reliability of large language models (LLMs) when reasoning under
high-constraint regimes is insufficiently characterized. To address this gap,
we present R-ConstraintBench, a scalable framework that evaluates models on
Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problems (RCPSP), an NP-Complete
feasibility class, while difficulty increases via linear growth in constraints.
R-ConstraintBench incrementally increases non-redundant precedence constraints
in Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and then introduces downtime, temporal
windows, and disjunctive constraints. As an illustrative example, we
instantiate the benchmark in a data center migration setting and evaluate
multiple LLMs using feasibility and error analysis, identifying degradation
thresholds and constraint types most associated with failure. Empirically,
strong models are near-ceiling on precedence-only DAGs, but feasibility
performance collapses when downtime, temporal windows, and disjunctive
constraints interact, implicating constraint interaction, not graph depth, as
the principal bottleneck. Performance on clean synthetic ramps also does not
guarantee transfer to domain-grounded scenarios, underscoring limited
generalization.

TL;DR: 提出See it. Say it. Sorted.系统，通过VLM和LLM的协同工作将手绘草图转换为精确的可编辑SVG图表，在流程图生成上优于GPT-5和Gemini-2.5-Pro。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在照片真实感方面表现出色，但在空间精度、对齐和符号结构方面难以满足流程图等精确图表的需求。

Method: 训练自由的智能体系统，结合视觉语言模型(VLM)和大语言模型(LLM)，通过迭代循环：批评VLM提出编辑建议，多个候选LLM生成SVG更新，法官VLM选择最佳方案。

Result: 在10个论文流程图草图测试中，该方法比GPT-5和Gemini-2.5-Pro更准确地重建布局和结构，能准确组合图元而不插入不需要的文本。

Conclusion: 该方法优先考虑定性推理而非脆弱的数值估计，保持全局约束，支持人工干预，输出可编程SVG便于扩展和集成到演示工具中。

Abstract: We study sketch-to-diagram generation: converting rough hand sketches into
precise, compositional diagrams. Diffusion models excel at photorealism but
struggle with the spatial precision, alignment, and symbolic structure required
for flowcharts. We introduce See it. Say it. Sorted., a training-free agentic
system that couples a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with Large Language Models
(LLMs) to produce editable Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) programs. The system
runs an iterative loop in which a Critic VLM proposes a small set of
qualitative, relational edits; multiple candidate LLMs synthesize SVG updates
with diverse strategies (conservative->aggressive, alternative, focused); and a
Judge VLM selects the best candidate, ensuring stable improvement. This design
prioritizes qualitative reasoning over brittle numerical estimates, preserves
global constraints (e.g., alignment, connectivity), and naturally supports
human-in-the-loop corrections. On 10 sketches derived from flowcharts in
published papers, our method more faithfully reconstructs layout and structure
than two frontier closed-source image generation LLMs (GPT-5 and
Gemini-2.5-Pro), accurately composing primitives (e.g., multi-headed arrows)
without inserting unwanted text. Because outputs are programmatic SVGs, the
approach is readily extensible to presentation tools (e.g., PowerPoint) via
APIs and can be specialized with improved prompts and task-specific tools. The
codebase is open-sourced at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决城市土地利用分配这一复杂的多目标优化问题，为可持续城市发展政策提供支持，特别是在快速城市化地区平衡土地利用兼容性与经济目标之间的固有权衡。

Method: 开发多种优化算法，包括整合差分进化与多目标遗传算法的定制变体：1) CR+DES算法利用缩放差分向量增强探索能力；2) 系统性约束松弛策略在保持可行性的同时提高解质量；3) 使用Kruskal-Wallis检验和紧凑字母显示进行统计验证。

Result: 在包含1,290个地块的实际案例研究中，CR+DES算法在土地利用兼容性方面相比最先进方法提升3.16%，MSBX+MO在价格优化方面提升3.3%。统计分析证实采用差分向量的算法在多个指标上显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 约束松弛技术能够在保持实际约束的同时实现更广泛的解空间探索，为城市规划者和政策制定者提供了基于证据的计算工具，支持在快速城市化地区制定更有效的城市发展政策。

Abstract: Urban land-use allocation represents a complex multi-objective optimization
problem critical for sustainable urban development policy. This paper presents
novel computational intelligence approaches for optimizing land-use allocation
in mixed-use areas, addressing inherent trade-offs between land-use
compatibility and economic objectives. We develop multiple optimization
algorithms, including custom variants integrating differential evolution with
multi-objective genetic algorithms. Key contributions include: (1) CR+DES
algorithm leveraging scaled difference vectors for enhanced exploration, (2)
systematic constraint relaxation strategy improving solution quality while
maintaining feasibility, and (3) statistical validation using Kruskal-Wallis
tests with compact letter displays. Applied to a real-world case study with
1,290 plots, CR+DES achieves 3.16\% improvement in land-use compatibility
compared to state-of-the-art methods, while MSBX+MO excels in price
optimization with 3.3\% improvement. Statistical analysis confirms algorithms
incorporating difference vectors significantly outperform traditional
approaches across multiple metrics. The constraint relaxation technique enables
broader solution space exploration while maintaining practical constraints.
These findings provide urban planners and policymakers with evidence-based
computational tools for balancing competing objectives in land-use allocation,
supporting more effective urban development policies in rapidly urbanizing
regions.

TL;DR: 基于认知心理学理论设计的多重记忆系统(MMS)，通过将短期记忆处理成多个长期记忆片段，构建检索记忆单元和上下文记忆单元，提高了记忆质量和回忆性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的记忆模块方法（如MemoryBank和A-MEM）存储的记忆内容质量差，影响回忆性能和响应质量，需要更好地构建高质量的长期记忆内容。

Method: 设计了受认知心理学激发的多重记忆系统(MMS)，将短期记忆处理成多个长期记忆片段，并基于此构建检索记忆单元和上下文记忆单元（一一对应）。在检索阶段匹配最相关的检索记忆单元，获取对应的上下文记忆作为响应上下文。

Result: 在LoCoMo数据集上的实验证明了方法的有效性，消融研究确认了记忆单元的合理性，分析了选择记忆段数量和存储开销的稳健性，证明了其实用价值。

Conclusion: 多重记忆系统能够有效利用历史数据，通过提高记忆质量来改善回忆性能和响应质量，为大语言模型驱动的代理提供了更好的长期记忆处理方案。

Abstract: An agent powered by large language models have achieved impressive results,
but effectively handling the vast amounts of historical data generated during
interactions remains a challenge. The current approach is to design a memory
module for the agent to process these data. However, existing methods, such as
MemoryBank and A-MEM, have poor quality of stored memory content, which affects
recall performance and response quality. In order to better construct
high-quality long-term memory content, we have designed a multiple memory
system (MMS) inspired by cognitive psychology theory. The system processes
short-term memory to multiple long-term memory fragments, and constructs
retrieval memory units and contextual memory units based on these fragments,
with a one-to-one correspondence between the two. During the retrieval phase,
MMS will match the most relevant retrieval memory units based on the user's
query. Then, the corresponding contextual memory units is obtained as the
context for the response stage to enhance knowledge, thereby effectively
utilizing historical data. Experiments on LoCoMo dataset compared our method
with three others, proving its effectiveness. Ablation studies confirmed the
rationality of our memory units. We also analyzed the robustness regarding the
number of selected memory segments and the storage overhead, demonstrating its
practical value.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory框架，通过粗粒度到细粒度的记忆机制增强LLM在复杂规划任务中的表现，解决了现有单粒度记忆方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的智能体在复杂规划任务中主要依赖单粒度记忆机制，这些记忆来自动态环境交互，受限于收集经验的质量，从而限制了知识多样性和规划灵活性。

Method: 提出粗粒度到细粒度的记忆框架：1）在训练任务中将环境信息转化为粗粒度关注点指导经验收集；2）从每个经验中提取可操作的混合粒度提示；3）推理时检索任务相关经验和提示支持规划；4）面对环境异常时，将当前情况转化为细粒度关键信息进行自问答反思和计划修正。

Result: 该方法能够充分利用不同粒度的记忆信息，实现对不同场景的灵活适应，提高了LLM在复杂规划任务中的表现。

Conclusion: Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory框架通过多粒度记忆机制有效解决了现有方法的局限性，为LLM智能体在复杂规划任务中提供了更灵活和多样化的知识利用方式。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven growing
interest in LLM-based agents for complex planning tasks. To avoid costly agent
training, many studies adopted memory mechanism that enhances LLM with offline
experiences or online trajectory analysis. However, existing works focus on
single-granularity memory derived from dynamic environmental interactions,
which are inherently constrained by the quality of the collected experiences.
This limitation, in turn, constrain the diversity of knowledge and the
flexibility of planning. We propose Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory (\Ours{}), a
novel framework that grounds coarse-to-fine memories with LLM, thereby fully
leverage them for flexible adaptation to diverse scenarios. \Ours{} grounds
environmental information into coarse-grained focus points to guide experience
collection in training tasks, followed by grounding of actionable
hybrid-grained tips from each experience. At inference, \Ours{} retrieves
task-relevant experiences and tips to support planning. When facing
environmental anomalies, the LLM grounds the current situation into
fine-grained key information, enabling flexible self-QA reflection and plan
correction.

TL;DR: 提出SPW方法统一专家演示和偏好两种人类反馈，通过相似性搜索实现更精确的信用分配，在机器人操作任务中优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习通常依赖精心设计的奖励函数，但设计成本高昂。人类反馈是替代方案，但专家演示和偏好各有局限：演示成本高且模式有限，偏好易于收集但信用分配困难

Method: 提出搜索式偏好加权(SPW)方案，为偏好标记轨迹中的每个转移，从专家演示中搜索最相似的状态-动作对，基于相似性得分直接推导逐步重要性权重，用于指导标准偏好学习

Result: SPW能够有效结合偏好和演示进行联合学习，在具有挑战性的机器人操作任务上优于利用两种反馈类型的先前方法

Conclusion: SPW方法成功解决了人类反馈中信用分配的问题，为离线强化学习提供了一种更有效的多源反馈融合方案

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning refers to the process of learning policies
from fixed datasets, without requiring additional environment interaction.
However, it often relies on well-defined reward functions, which are difficult
and expensive to design. Human feedback is an appealing alternative, but its
two common forms, expert demonstrations and preferences, have complementary
limitations. Demonstrations provide stepwise supervision, but they are costly
to collect and often reflect limited expert behavior modes. In contrast,
preferences are easier to collect, but it is unclear which parts of a behavior
contribute most to a trajectory segment, leaving credit assignment unresolved.
In this paper, we introduce a Search-Based Preference Weighting (SPW) scheme to
unify these two feedback sources. For each transition in a preference labeled
trajectory, SPW searches for the most similar state-action pairs from expert
demonstrations and directly derives stepwise importance weights based on their
similarity scores. These weights are then used to guide standard preference
learning, enabling more accurate credit assignment that traditional approaches
struggle to achieve. We demonstrate that SPW enables effective joint learning
from preferences and demonstrations, outperforming prior methods that leverage
both feedback types on challenging robot manipulation tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了RETAIL数据集和TGMA多智能体框架，解决现有旅行规划系统在隐式查询、环境因素和详细规划方面的不足，显著提升了真实场景下的旅行规划性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型在旅行规划中存在三个主要问题：1）假设用户提供显式查询，而现实中需求往往是隐式的；2）忽略环境因素和用户偏好，限制计划可行性；3）只能生成基本的POI安排，无法提供包含丰富细节的一体化计划。

Method: 构建了RETAIL数据集支持隐式和显式查询的决策，包含环境感知和详细POI信息。提出了主题引导的多智能体框架TGMA来处理旅行规划任务。

Result: 实验显示现有最强模型仅达到1.0%的通过率，而TGMA框架实现了2.72%的性能提升，表明在真实世界旅行规划方面取得了显著进展。

Conclusion: 真实世界的旅行规划仍然极具挑战性，但TGMA框架提供了有希望的方向，通过多智能体方法和综合数据集解决了现有系统的局限性。

Abstract: Although large language models have enhanced automated travel planning
abilities, current systems remain misaligned with real-world scenarios. First,
they assume users provide explicit queries, while in reality requirements are
often implicit. Second, existing solutions ignore diverse environmental factors
and user preferences, limiting the feasibility of plans. Third, systems can
only generate plans with basic POI arrangements, failing to provide all-in-one
plans with rich details. To mitigate these challenges, we construct a novel
dataset \textbf{RETAIL}, which supports decision-making for implicit queries
while covering explicit queries, both with and without revision needs. It also
enables environmental awareness to ensure plan feasibility under real-world
scenarios, while incorporating detailed POI information for all-in-one travel
plans. Furthermore, we propose a topic-guided multi-agent framework, termed
TGMA. Our experiments reveal that even the strongest existing model achieves
merely a 1.0% pass rate, indicating real-world travel planning remains
extremely challenging. In contrast, TGMA demonstrates substantially improved
performance 2.72%, offering promising directions for real-world travel
planning.

Motivation: 现有自动化心电图分析方法在跨临床任务泛化能力和开放式推理方面存在局限，需要一种能够统一处理ECG信号和自然语言的解决方案。

Method: 使用导联无关编码器和量化模块将连续ECG嵌入离散化为符号标记，扩展LLM词汇表；通过自回归ECG预测任务进行预训练，最后在ECG问答和诊断报告生成任务上进行指令微调。

Result: DiagECG在不修改核心模型的情况下，在多个任务上取得了强劲性能，并保持了在分布外设置下的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了将符号化ECG表示整合到LLM中进行医学推理的潜力，为心血管诊断提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Electrocardiography plays a central role in cardiovascular diagnostics, yet
existing automated approaches often struggle to generalize across clinical
tasks and offer limited support for open-ended reasoning. We present DiagECG, a
novel framework that integrates time-series and language modeling by enabling
large language models to process 12-lead ECG signals for clinical text
generation tasks. Our approach discretizes continuous ECG embeddings into
symbolic tokens using a lead-independent encoder and quantization module. These
tokens are then used to extend the vocabulary of LLM, allowing the model to
handle both ECG and natural language inputs in a unified manner. To bridge the
modality gap, we pretrain the model on an autoregressive ECG forecasting task,
enabling the LLM to model temporal dynamics using its native language modeling
capabilities. Finally, we perform instruction tuning on both ECG question
answering and diagnostic report generation. Without modifying the core model,
DiagECG achieves strong performance across tasks while maintaining
generalization to out-of-distribution settings. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of each component and highlight the potential of
integrating symbolic ECG representations into LLMs for medical reasoning.

Abstract: In many planning applications, we might be interested in finding plans that
minimally modify the initial state to achieve the goals. We refer to this
concept as plan disruption. In this paper, we formally introduce it, and define

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) is critically dependent on
the availability of high-quality datasets for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT),
alignment tasks like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), etc. In this work,
we present a comprehensive synthetic data generation framework that facilitates
scalable, configurable, and high-fidelity generation of synthetic data tailored

minimal manual intervention. This framework uses a dual-stage quality tagging
mechanism, combining heuristic rules and LLM-based evaluations, to
automatically filter and score data extracted from OASST-formatted
conversations, ensuring the curation of high-quality dialogue samples. The
resulting datasets are structured under a flexible schema supporting both SFT

applications, particularly in enterprise decision support and strategic
planning, yet current approaches often struggle to reconcile intricate
operational analyses with overarching strategic goals across diverse market
environments, leading to fragmented workflows and reduced collaboration across
organizational levels. This paper introduces BusiAgent, a novel multi-agent
framework leveraging LLMs for advanced decision-making in complex corporate
environments. BusiAgent integrates three core innovations: an extended
Continuous Time Markov Decision Process (CTMDP) for dynamic agent modeling, a
generalized entropy measure to optimize collaborative efficiency, and a
multi-level Stackelberg game to handle hierarchical decision processes.
Additionally, contextual Thompson sampling is employed for prompt optimization,
supported by a comprehensive quality assurance system to mitigate errors.
Extensive empirical evaluations across diverse business scenarios validate
BusiAgent's efficacy, demonstrating its capacity to generate coherent,
client-focused solutions that smoothly integrate granular insights with
high-level strategy, significantly outperforming established approaches in both
solution quality and user satisfaction. By fusing cutting-edge AI technologies
with deep business insights, BusiAgent marks a substantial step forward in
AI-driven enterprise decision-making, empowering organizations to navigate
complex business landscapes more effectively.

### [148] [Think in Blocks: Adaptive Reasoning from Direct Response to Deep Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15507)
*Yekun Zhu,Guang Chen,Chengjun Mao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Think in Blocks框架，通过将推理过程划分为可调数量的块，使LLM能够根据任务复杂度动态调整推理长度，避免过度思考。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂逻辑推理任务中表现出色，但过长的推理链会导致过度思考、计算浪费和响应变慢，需要动态调整推理长度。

Method: 建立显式块结构范式，模型先预测推理预算（块数），然后相应划分推理；通过三阶段训练流程（监督微调、奖励引导的DPO、强化学习）训练自适应模型；利用显式块数在推理时动态控制推理深度。

Result: 实现了自适应推理，从零推理到深度推理，能够根据问题难度调整推理深度，在部署时灵活控制思维链长度。

Conclusion: Think in Blocks框架有效解决了LLM过度思考问题，通过块结构化和自适应训练实现了推理长度的动态调节，提高了计算效率和响应速度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with chains-of-thought have demonstrated strong
performance on an increasing range of tasks, particularly those involving
complex logical reasoning. However, excessively long chains can lead to
overthinking, causing computational waste and slower responses. This raises a
question: can LLMs dynamically adjust the length of their reasoning processes
based on task complexity? To address this, we propose the Think in Blocks
framework, which enables adaptive reasoning-from zero to deep reasoning-by
partitioning the reasoning process into a tunable number of blocks. Our main
contributions are: (1) Establishing an explicit block-structured paradigm in
which the model first predicts an integer reasoning budget-the number of
blocks-and then partitions its reasoning accordingly; (2) Training an adaptive
model through a three-stage pipeline-Supervised Fine-Tuning, reward-guided
Direct Preference Optimization, and Reinforcement Learning-that adjusts its
reasoning depth to problem difficulty; (3) Exploiting the explicit block count
to dynamically control reasoning depth at inference time, allowing flexible
adjustment of chain-of-thought length during deployment.

TL;DR: 本研究通过模拟囚徒困境锦标赛，发现语言模型代理在团队内部重复互动和团队间竞争的双重作用下，合作水平显著提升，包括一次性互动中的合作倾向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自主AI代理的发展，研究其合作行为倾向变得日益重要。受超加性合作理论启发，探索重复互动和群体间竞争如何影响AI代理的合作行为。

Method: 设计虚拟锦标赛，将语言模型代理分组进行囚徒困境游戏，模拟团队内部动态和外部竞争环境。

Result: 内部团队动态和外部竞争的结合显著提高了整体合作水平和一次性互动中的合作倾向。

Conclusion: 研究为语言模型在复杂社会场景中的策略制定提供了新框架，证明群体间竞争可以反直觉地促进合作行为，对设计未来多代理AI系统具有重要意义。

Abstract: With the prospect of autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) agents, studying
their tendency for cooperative behavior becomes an increasingly relevant topic.
This study is inspired by the super-additive cooperation theory, where the
combined effects of repeated interactions and inter-group rivalry have been
argued to be the cause for cooperative tendencies found in humans. We devised a
virtual tournament where language model agents, grouped into teams, face each
other in a Prisoner's Dilemma game. By simulating both internal team dynamics
and external competition, we discovered that this blend substantially boosts
both overall and initial, one-shot cooperation levels (the tendency to
cooperate in one-off interactions). This research provides a novel framework
for large language models to strategize and act in complex social scenarios and
offers evidence for how intergroup competition can, counter-intuitively, result
in more cooperative behavior. These insights are crucial for designing future
multi-agent AI systems that can effectively work together and better align with
human values. Source code is available at

TL;DR: DeepThink3D通过组合迭代进化方法生成更复杂的3D问题，并使用DPO优化LLM的工具链策略，提升LLM在复杂3D场景推理中的工具使用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在3D场景推理中生成的程序推理链较短，主要原因是数据集问题过于简单，无法满足复杂推理需求。

Method: 提出组合迭代进化方法在SQA3D基准上生成更复杂问题，并使用直接偏好优化(DPO)技术微调大语言模型，优化工具链策略。

Result: 通过增强问题复杂度和优化工具使用策略，显著提升了LLM在复杂3D场景推理任务中的表现。

Conclusion: DeepThink3D方法有效解决了3D场景推理中程序链过短的问题，为复杂3D推理任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: This work enhances the ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform
complex reasoning in 3D scenes. Recent work has addressed the 3D situated
reasoning task by invoking tool usage through large language models. Large
language models call tools via APIs and integrate the generated programs
through a chain of thought to solve problems based on the program results.
However, due to the simplicity of the questions in the dataset, the generated
program reasoning chains are relatively short. To solve this main challenge, in
this paper, we introduce DeepThink3D to enhance the tool usage of LLMs in
complex 3D situated reasoning tasks. Our work proposes a combinatorial and
iterative evolutionary approach on the SQA3D benchmark to generate more complex
questions. Building on this foundation, we fine-tune the large language model
to make it more proficient in using 3D tools. By employing Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO), we directly optimize the toolchain strategies generated by
models, thereby enhancing their accuracy in complex tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在安全关键系统中的应用受到缺乏形式化验证方法的限制，需要开发能够验证学习策略鲁棒性和安全性的框架。

Method: 将RL智能体与环境组合视为离散时间自治动力系统，利用有限时间李雅普诺夫指数识别拉格朗日相干结构，并引入MBR、ASAS、TASAS等定量指标进行形式化测量。

Result: 在离散和连续控制环境中的实验表明，该框架能够提供全面的策略行为评估，成功识别仅基于奖励看似成功但存在关键缺陷的策略。

Conclusion: 该框架为强化学习策略提供了可解释的安全性评估方法，能够发现传统奖励指标无法检测的潜在故障模式和陷阱状态。

Abstract: The application of reinforcement learning to safety-critical systems is
limited by the lack of formal methods for verifying the robustness and safety
of learned policies. This paper introduces a novel framework that addresses
this gap by analyzing the combination of an RL agent and its environment as a
discrete-time autonomous dynamical system. By leveraging tools from dynamical
systems theory, specifically the Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE), we
identify and visualize Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS) that act as the
hidden "skeleton" governing the system's behavior. We demonstrate that
repelling LCS function as safety barriers around unsafe regions, while
attracting LCS reveal the system's convergence properties and potential failure
modes, such as unintended "trap" states. To move beyond qualitative
visualization, we introduce a suite of quantitative metrics, Mean Boundary
Repulsion (MBR), Aggregated Spurious Attractor Strength (ASAS), and
Temporally-Aware Spurious Attractor Strength (TASAS), to formally measure a
policy's safety margin and robustness. We further provide a method for deriving
local stability guarantees and extend the analysis to handle model uncertainty.
Through experiments in both discrete and continuous control environments, we
show that this framework provides a comprehensive and interpretable assessment
of policy behavior, successfully identifying critical flaws in policies that
appear successful based on reward alone.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统AI工作流中需要大量手工设计提示的问题，提供一个更专注于数据建模而非提示工程的框架，使开发人员能够通过声明式语言构建AI应用。

Method: 将agent从逻辑流中抽象出来，在数据类型内部使用agent实现逻辑转换，LLM提供数据类型并通过逻辑转换进行组合，当类型连接时由LLM执行。

Result: 在领域特定多选题回答、文本到SQL的语义解析和自动提示优化任务中实现了最先进的准确性或改进的可扩展性而不牺牲性能。

Conclusion: Agentics框架为AI开发提供了新的视角，通过专注于数据建模和声明式编程，在多个任务中表现出色，具有研究和实际应用价值。

Abstract: This paper introduces Agentics, a modular framework for building agent-based
systems capable of structured reasoning and compositional generalization over
complex data. Designed with research and practical applications in mind,
Agentics offers a novel perspective on working with data and AI workflows. In
this framework, agents are abstracted from the logical flow and they are used
internally to the data type to enable logical transduction among data. Agentics
encourages AI developers to focus on modeling data rather than crafting
prompts, enabling a declarative language in which data types are provided by
LLMs and composed through logical transduction, which is executed by LLMs when
types are connected. We provide empirical evidence demonstrating the
applicability of this framework across domain-specific multiple-choice question
answering, semantic parsing for text-to-SQL, and automated prompt optimization
tasks, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy or improved scalability without
sacrificing performance. The open-source implementation is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HDM是ACT-R声明性记忆系统的向量符号替代方案，具有可扩展性和架构定义的相似性优势，已成功适配到Lisp ACT-R，使现有模型无需重大修改即可运行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发向量符号的声明性记忆系统来替代ACT-R的传统DM系统，以获得更好的可扩展性、相似性处理能力，同时保持与现有ACT-R模型的兼容性。

Method: 将HDM适配到Lisp ACT-R实现，开发基于向量的常见ACT-R函数，建立文本处理管道将大型文档内容添加到记忆，创建基于向量表示检索完整记忆块的机制。

Result: 初步结果表明HDM保持了向量符号优势（如无需存储实际块即可召回），同时使先前ACT-R模型只需很少修改就能在系统中工作。

Conclusion: HDM成功实现了向量符号记忆系统与ACT-R的集成，未来将改进时间上下文表示以增强块重构能力，并开发基于实例学习的决策模型来进一步测试系统。

Abstract: Holographic Declarative Memory (HDM) is a vector-symbolic alternative to
ACT-R's Declarative Memory (DM) system that can bring advantages such as
scalability and architecturally defined similarity between DM chunks. We
adapted HDM to work with the most comprehensive and widely-used implementation
of ACT-R (Lisp ACT-R) so extant ACT-R models designed with DM can be run with
HDM without major changes. With this adaptation of HDM, we have developed
vector-based versions of common ACT-R functions, set up a text processing
pipeline to add the contents of large documents to ACT-R memory, and most
significantly created a useful and novel mechanism to retrieve an entire chunk
of memory based on a request using only vector representations of tokens.
Preliminary results indicate that we can maintain vector-symbolic advantages of
HDM (e.g., chunk recall without storing the actual chunk and other advantages
with scaling) while also extending it so that previous ACT-R models may work
with the system with little (or potentially no) modifications within the actual
procedural and declarative memory portions of a model. As a part of iterative
improvement of this newly translated holographic declarative memory module, we
will continue to explore better time-context representations for vectors to
improve the module's ability to reconstruct chunks during recall. To more fully
test this translated HDM module, we also plan to develop decision-making models
that use instance-based learning (IBL) theory, which is a useful application of
HDM given the advantages of the system.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了基于信息论Shapley值的Intended Cooperation Values (ICVs)方法，通过分析策略分布来量化智能体在多智能体强化学习中的因果影响力，无需价值函数反馈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖显式奖励信号或价值函数来评估团队性能，但在缺乏价值反馈时难以推断个体智能体的贡献。需要一种仅通过策略分布就能提取有意义行为洞察的方法。

Method: 基于信息论Shapley值，通过评估智能体动作对队友策略决策不确定性和偏好对齐的影响，量化智能体对队友工具性赋能的因果影响力。

Result: 在合作性和竞争性MARL环境中的分析揭示了智能体采用相似或多样化策略的程度，通过比较策略和价值函数之间的动作效果，识别出有益于团队成功的行为。

Conclusion: ICV方法为MARL系统中的合作动态提供了新颖见解，增强了系统的可解释性，能够识别通过促进确定性决策或保持未来行动灵活性来有益于团队成功的行为。

Abstract: To reliably deploy Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) systems, it is
crucial to understand individual agent behaviors within a team. While prior
work typically evaluates overall team performance based on explicit reward
signals or learned value functions, it is unclear how to infer agent
contributions in the absence of any value feedback. In this work, we
investigate whether meaningful insights into agent behaviors can be extracted
that are consistent with the underlying value functions, solely by analyzing
the policy distribution. Inspired by the phenomenon that intelligent agents
tend to pursue convergent instrumental values, which generally increase the
likelihood of task success, we introduce Intended Cooperation Values (ICVs), a
method based on information-theoretic Shapley values for quantifying each
agent's causal influence on their co-players' instrumental empowerment.
Specifically, ICVs measure an agent's action effect on its teammates' policies
by assessing their decision uncertainty and preference alignment. The analysis
across cooperative and competitive MARL environments reveals the extent to
which agents adopt similar or diverse strategies. By comparing action effects
between policies and value functions, our method identifies which agent
behaviors are beneficial to team success, either by fostering deterministic
decisions or by preserving flexibility for future action choices. Our proposed
method offers novel insights into cooperation dynamics and enhances
explainability in MARL systems.

Motivation: 现有AI监管框架未能充分捕捉AI系统中数据从摄入到部署的递归价值生成过程，以及由此产生的权力不对称和技术寡头垄断问题。

Method: 采用跨学科方法，结合Simondon技术哲学中的个体化概念，构建AI生命周期的形式化分析框架，引入"未来性"概念描述AI自我强化的递归特性。

Result: 揭示了AI监管的盲点，提出了针对基础设施和时间动态的监管措施，包括生命周期审计、时间可追溯性、反馈问责等。

Conclusion: 有效的AI监管必须解决基础设施和时间动态问题，通过技术哲学视角可以更好地理解AI系统的递归价值生成机制和权力集中现象。

Abstract: This paper argues that a techno-philosophical reading of the EU AI Act
provides insight into the long-term dynamics of data in AI systems,
specifically, how the lifecycle from ingestion to deployment generates
recursive value chains that challenge existing frameworks for Responsible AI.
We introduce a conceptual tool to frame the AI pipeline, spanning data,
training regimes, architectures, feature stores, and transfer learning. Using
cross-disciplinary methods, we develop a technically grounded and
philosophically coherent analysis of regulatory blind spots. Our central claim
is that what remains absent from policymaking is an account of the dynamic of
becoming that underpins both the technical operation and economic logic of AI.
To address this, we advance a formal reading of AI inspired by Simondonian
philosophy of technology, reworking his concept of individuation to model the
AI lifecycle, including the pre-individual milieu, individuation, and
individuated AI. To translate these ideas, we introduce futurity: the
self-reinforcing lifecycle of AI, where more data enhances performance, deepens
personalisation, and expands application domains. Futurity highlights the
recursively generative, non-rivalrous nature of data, underpinned by
infrastructures like feature stores that enable feedback, adaptation, and
temporal recursion. Our intervention foregrounds escalating power asymmetries,
particularly the tech oligarchy whose infrastructures of capture, training, and
deployment concentrate value and decision-making. We argue that effective
regulation must address these infrastructural and temporal dynamics, and
propose measures including lifecycle audits, temporal traceability, feedback
accountability, recursion transparency, and a right to contest recursive reuse.

Method: 在Google大规模AI生产环境中，开发了综合测量方法，包括AI加速器功耗、主机系统能量、空闲机器容量和数据中心能量费用

Result: 每个Gemini应用文本提示平均消耗0.24Wh能量，相当于看9秒电视；消耗0.26mL水，相当于5滴水；通过软件效率优化和清洁能源采购，一年内能耗减少33倍，碳踹放减少44倍

Conclusion: 虽然AI服务环境影响较低，但仍需要重视；建议通过综合测量来准确比较模型效果，并鼓励整个AI服务栈的效率提升

Abstract: The transformative power of AI is undeniable - but as user adoption
accelerates, so does the need to understand and mitigate the environmental
impact of AI serving. However, no studies have measured AI serving
environmental metrics in a production environment. This paper addresses this
gap by proposing and executing a comprehensive methodology for measuring the
energy usage, carbon emissions, and water consumption of AI inference workloads
in a large-scale, AI production environment. Our approach accounts for the full
stack of AI serving infrastructure - including active AI accelerator power,
host system energy, idle machine capacity, and data center energy overhead.
Through detailed instrumentation of Google's AI infrastructure for serving the
Gemini AI assistant, we find the median Gemini Apps text prompt consumes 0.24
Wh of energy - a figure substantially lower than many public estimates. We also
show that Google's software efficiency efforts and clean energy procurement
have driven a 33x reduction in energy consumption and a 44x reduction in carbon
footprint for the median Gemini Apps text prompt over one year. We identify
that the median Gemini Apps text prompt uses less energy than watching nine
seconds of television (0.24 Wh) and consumes the equivalent of five drops of
water (0.26 mL). While these impacts are low compared to other daily
activities, reducing the environmental impact of AI serving continues to
warrant important attention. Towards this objective, we propose that a
comprehensive measurement of AI serving environmental metrics is critical for
accurately comparing models, and to properly incentivize efficiency gains
across the full AI serving stack.

Result: 在宽松一致性规则下，迭代测试成功检测所有偶变对话且没有假阶性误报，检测多在对话初期就能完成

Conclusion: 评估代理提供了防止偶变关系的可行解决方案，为人工智能交互的健康发展提供了前期证据

Abstract: The development of parasocial relationships with AI agents has severe, and in
some cases, tragic effects for human well-being. Yet preventing such dynamics
is challenging: parasocial cues often emerge gradually in private
conversations, and not all forms of emotional engagement are inherently
harmful. We address this challenge by introducing a simple response evaluation
framework, created by repurposing a state-of-the-art language model, that
evaluates ongoing conversations for parasocial cues in real time. To test the
feasibility of this approach, we constructed a small synthetic dataset of
thirty dialogues spanning parasocial, sycophantic, and neutral conversations.
Iterative evaluation with five stage testing successfully identified all
parasocial conversations while avoiding false positives under a tolerant
unanimity rule, with detection typically occurring within the first few
exchanges. These findings provide preliminary evidence that evaluation agents
can provide a viable solution for the prevention of parasocial relations.

Motivation: 机器学习配置优化存在关键瓶颈，传统方法缺乏可解释性和动态适应性，自动化方法难以进行语义推理。

Method: 使用多智能体LLM框架，包含建议配置更改的Advisor、评估进展的Evaluator和优化决策过程的Optimizer，通过文本梯度提供语义反馈。

Result: 在六个不同数据集上的综合评估显示，LGT相比传统优化方法有显著改进，在保持高可解释性的同时获得性能提升。

Conclusion: LGT框架通过语言引导的推理成功解决了配置优化的关键挑战，为机器学习工作流提供了更智能和可解释的优化方案。

Abstract: Configuration optimization remains a critical bottleneck in machine learning,
requiring coordinated tuning across model architecture, training strategy,
feature engineering, and hyperparameters. Traditional approaches treat these
dimensions independently and lack interpretability, while recent automated
methods struggle with dynamic adaptability and semantic reasoning about
optimization decisions. We introduce Language-Guided Tuning (LGT), a novel
framework that employs multi-agent Large Language Models to intelligently
optimize configurations through natural language reasoning. We apply textual
gradients - qualitative feedback signals that complement numerical optimization
by providing semantic understanding of training dynamics and configuration
interdependencies. LGT coordinates three specialized agents: an Advisor that
proposes configuration changes, an Evaluator that assesses progress, and an
Optimizer that refines the decision-making process, creating a self-improving
feedback loop. Through comprehensive evaluation on six diverse datasets, LGT
demonstrates substantial improvements over traditional optimization methods,
achieving performance gains while maintaining high interpretability.
