To address these challenges, inspired by the human cognitive\nprocess, we propose Causal-aware LLMs, which integrate the structural causal\nmodel (SCM) into the decision-making process to model, update, and utilize\nstructured knowledge of the environment in a ``learning-adapting-acting\"\nparadigm.

Existing discourse\nemphasizes EV battery costs as being principally responsible for this price\ndifferential and widespread adoption is routinely conditioned upon battery\ncosts declining. We scrutinize such reasoning by sourcing data on EV attributes\nand market conditions between 2011 and 2023. Our findings are fourfold. First,\nEV prices are influenced principally by the number of amenities, additional\nfeatures, and dealer-installed accessories sold as standard on an EV, and to a\nlesser extent, by EV horsepower. Second, EV range is negatively correlated with\nEV price implying that range anxiety concerns may be less consequential than\nexisting discourse suggests. Third, battery capacity is positively correlated\nwith EV price, due to more capacity being synonymous with the delivery of more\nhorsepower. Collectively, this suggests that higher procurement prices for EVs\nreflects consumer preference for vehicles that are feature dense and more\npowerful. Fourth and finally, accommodating these preferences have produced\nvehicles with lower fuel economy, a shift that reduces envisioned lifecycle\nemissions benefits by at least 3.26 percent, subject to the battery pack\nchemistry leveraged and the carbon intensity of the electrical grid.

Camera-ready submission. Link\n  to code: https://github.com/kumuji/mix3d - Project page:\n  https://nekrasov.dev/mix3d/", "summary": "We present Mix3D, a data augmentation technique for segmenting large-scale 3D\nscenes. Since scene context helps reasoning about object semantics, current\nworks focus on models with large capacity and receptive fields that can fully\ncapture the global context of an input 3D scene. However, strong contextual\npriors can have detrimental implications like mistaking a pedestrian crossing\nthe street for a car. In this work, we focus on the importance of balancing\nglobal scene context and local geometry, with the goal of generalizing beyond\nthe contextual priors in the training set. In particular, we propose a \"mixing\"\ntechnique which creates new training samples by combining two augmented scenes.\nBy doing so, object instances are implicitly placed into novel out-of-context\nenvironments and therefore making it harder for models to rely on scene context\nalone, and instead infer semantics from local structure as well. We perform\ndetailed analysis to understand the importance of global context, local\nstructures and the effect of mixing scenes. In experiments, we show that models\ntrained with Mix3D profit from a significant performance boost on indoor\n(ScanNet, S3DIS) and outdoor datasets (SemanticKITTI). Mix3D can be trivially\nused with any existing method, e.g., trained with Mix3D, MinkowskiNet\noutperforms all prior state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin on the\nScanNet test benchmark 78.1 mIoU.

In\npractice, because of the high demands on latency and memory, it is particularly\nchallenging to develop an efficient RL framework that reliably manages policy\nmodels with hundreds to thousands of billions of parameters.\n  In this paper, we present LlamaRL, a fully distributed, asynchronous RL\nframework optimized for efficient training of large-scale LLMs with various\nmodel sizes (8B, 70B, and 405B parameters) on GPU clusters ranging from a\nhandful to thousands of devices. LlamaRL introduces a streamlined,\nsingle-controller architecture built entirely on native PyTorch, enabling\nmodularity, ease of use, and seamless scalability to thousands of GPUs. We also\nprovide a theoretical analysis of LlamaRL's efficiency, including a formal\nproof that its asynchronous design leads to strict RL speed-up. Empirically, by\nleveraging best practices such as colocated model offloading, asynchronous\noff-policy training, and distributed direct memory access for weight\nsynchronization, LlamaRL achieves significant efficiency gains -- up to 10.7x\nspeed-up compared to DeepSpeed-Chat-like systems on a 405B-parameter policy\nmodel. Furthermore, the efficiency advantage continues to grow with increasing\nmodel scale, demonstrating the framework's suitability for future large-scale\nRL training."}

The abundance of methods proposed to modify LLM behavior\nmakes it unclear whether current LLMs are already steerable, or require further\nintervention. In particular, LLMs may exhibit (i) poor coverage, where rare\nuser goals are underrepresented; (ii) miscalibration, where models overshoot\nrequests; and (iii) side effects, where changes to one dimension of text\ninadvertently affect others. To systematically evaluate these failures, we\nintroduce a framework based on a multi-dimensional goal space that models user\ngoals and LLM outputs as vectors with dimensions corresponding to text\nattributes (e.g., reading difficulty). Applied to a text-rewriting task, we\nfind that current LLMs struggle with steerability, as side effects are\npersistent. Interventions to improve steerability, such as prompt engineering,\nbest-of-$N$ sampling, and reinforcement learning fine-tuning, have varying\neffectiveness, yet side effects remain problematic. Our findings suggest that\neven strong LLMs struggle with steerability, and existing alignment strategies\nmay be insufficient.

To realize this, we propose a\nnovel agentic ML training framework with three key components: (1)\nexploration-enriched fine-tuning, which enables LLM agents to generate diverse\nactions for enhanced RL exploration; (2) step-wise RL, which enables training\non a single action step, accelerating experience collection and improving\ntraining efficiency; (3) an agentic ML-specific reward module, which unifies\nvaried ML feedback signals into consistent rewards for RL optimization.\nLeveraging this framework, we train ML-Agent, driven by a 7B-sized Qwen-2.5 LLM\nfor autonomous ML.
