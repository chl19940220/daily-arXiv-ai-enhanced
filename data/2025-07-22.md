*Andreas Alpers,Orkun Furat,Christian Jung,Matthias Neumann,Claudia Redenbach,Aigerim Saken,Volker Schmidt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 比较分析用于拟合3D图像数据的镶嵌模型算法策略，评估优化方法并权衡模型复杂度与近似质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在材料科学中，准确拟合3D图像数据（如多晶体和泡沫）的镶嵌模型是一个不断发展的领域，需要评估不同优化方法的适用性。

Method: 比较线性/非线性规划、随机优化（交叉熵法）和梯度下降等方法，生成Voronoi、Laguerre和广义平衡功率图（GBPDs）以近似体素结构。

Result: 通过实际数据集评估拟合质量，发现模型复杂度、优化方法复杂度与近似质量之间存在权衡关系。

Conclusion: 研究结果为根据数据特征和应用需求选择合适方法提供了指导。

Abstract: This paper presents a comparative analysis of algorithmic strategies for
fitting tessellation models to 3D image data of materials such as polycrystals
and foams. In this steadily advancing field, we review and assess
optimization-based methods -- including linear and nonlinear programming,
stochastic optimization via the cross-entropy method, and gradient descent --
for generating Voronoi, Laguerre, and generalized balanced power diagrams
(GBPDs) that approximate voxelbased grain structures. The quality of fit is
evaluated on real-world datasets using discrepancy measures that quantify
differences in grain volume, surface area, and topology. Our results highlight
trade-offs between model complexity, the complexity of the optimization
routines involved, and the quality of approximation, providing guidance for
selecting appropriate methods based on data characteristics and application
needs.

### [2] [Semantic Segmentation based Scene Understanding in Autonomous Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14303)
*Ehsan Rassekh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了深度学习在语义分割中的应用，提出了几种高效模型，并研究了不同主干网络对性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工智能和深度学习在复杂任务中表现出色，特别是在自动驾驶领域。研究旨在通过语义分割提升场景理解能力。

Method: 使用BDD100k数据集，提出多种模型并测试不同主干网络作为编码器的效果。

Result: 结果表明，选择合适的主干网络显著提升了语义分割的性能，改善了准确性、平均IoU和损失函数。

Conclusion: 研究证实了主干网络选择对语义分割的重要性，为场景理解提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, the concept of artificial intelligence (AI) has become a
prominent keyword because it is promising in solving complex tasks. The need
for human expertise in specific areas may no longer be needed because machines
have achieved successful results using artificial intelligence and can make the
right decisions in critical situations. This process is possible with the help
of deep learning (DL), one of the most popular artificial intelligence
technologies. One of the areas in which the use of DL is used is in the
development of self-driving cars, which is very effective and important. In
this work, we propose several efficient models to investigate scene
understanding through semantic segmentation. We use the BDD100k dataset to
investigate these models. Another contribution of this work is the usage of
several Backbones as encoders for models. The obtained results show that
choosing the appropriate backbone has a great effect on the performance of the
model for semantic segmentation. Better performance in semantic segmentation
allows us to understand better the scene and the environment around the agent.
In the end, we analyze and evaluate the proposed models in terms of accuracy,
mean IoU, and loss function, and the results show that these metrics are
improved.

### [3] [CLIPTTA: Robust Contrastive Vision-Language Test-Time Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14312)
*Marc Lafon,Gustavo Adolfo Vargas Hakim,Clément Rambour,Christian Desrosier,Nicolas Thome*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIPTTA是一种基于梯度的测试时适应方法，针对视觉语言模型（VLMs），通过软对比损失提升泛化能力，并在开放集设置中改进OOD检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型在分布偏移下泛化能力不足的问题，避免熵最小化目标与对比训练目标的不匹配。

Method: 提出CLIPTTA方法，使用软对比损失与CLIP预训练目标对齐，并通过理论分析避免类别崩溃。

Result: 在75个数据集上表现优于基于熵的目标，并在开放集设置中通过OCE损失提升OOD检测。

Conclusion: CLIPTTA在多样分布偏移下表现稳定且优于现有方法。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP exhibit strong zero-shot capabilities
but often fail to generalize under distribution shifts. Test-time adaptation
(TTA) allows models to update at inference time without labeled data, typically
via entropy minimization. However, this objective is fundamentally misaligned
with the contrastive image-text training of VLMs, limiting adaptation
performance and introducing failure modes such as pseudo-label drift and class
collapse. We propose CLIPTTA, a new gradient-based TTA method for
vision-language models that leverages a soft contrastive loss aligned with
CLIP's pre-training objective. We provide a theoretical analysis of CLIPTTA's
gradients, showing how its batch-aware design mitigates the risk of collapse.
We further extend CLIPTTA to the open-set setting, where both in-distribution
(ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) samples are encountered, using an Outlier
Contrastive Exposure (OCE) loss to improve OOD detection. Evaluated on 75
datasets spanning diverse distribution shifts, CLIPTTA consistently outperforms
entropy-based objectives and is highly competitive with state-of-the-art TTA
methods, outperforming them on a large number of datasets and exhibiting more
stable performance across diverse shifts.

### [4] [A Hidden Stumbling Block in Generalized Category Discovery: Distracted Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14315)
*Qiyu Xu,Zhanxuan Hu,Yu Duan,Ercheng Pei,Yonghang Tai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为注意力聚焦（AF）的自适应机制，通过修剪非信息性标记来优化广义类别发现（GCD）中的特征提取。AF包含两个组件：标记重要性度量（TIME）和标记自适应修剪（TAP），显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GCD方法在处理未标记数据时，模型注意力容易被无关背景区域分散，导致特征提取不理想。

Method: AF通过TIME量化多尺度标记重要性，TAP利用这些分数修剪非信息性标记，从而优化注意力。

Result: AF集成到SimGCD方法中，性能提升高达15.4%，且计算开销极小。

Conclusion: AF是一种轻量级、即插即用的模块，能显著提升GCD方法的性能。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to classify unlabeled data from
both known and unknown categories by leveraging knowledge from labeled known
categories. While existing methods have made notable progress, they often
overlook a hidden stumbling block in GCD: distracted attention. Specifically,
when processing unlabeled data, models tend to focus not only on key objects in
the image but also on task-irrelevant background regions, leading to suboptimal
feature extraction. To remove this stumbling block, we propose Attention
Focusing (AF), an adaptive mechanism designed to sharpen the model's focus by
pruning non-informative tokens. AF consists of two simple yet effective
components: Token Importance Measurement (TIME) and Token Adaptive Pruning
(TAP), working in a cascade. TIME quantifies token importance across multiple
scales, while TAP prunes non-informative tokens by utilizing the multi-scale
importance scores provided by TIME. AF is a lightweight, plug-and-play module
that integrates seamlessly into existing GCD methods with minimal computational
overhead. When incorporated into one prominent GCD method, SimGCD, AF achieves
up to 15.4% performance improvement over the baseline with minimal
computational overhead. The implementation code is provided in
https://github.com/Afleve/AFGCD.

### [5] [Hallucination Score: Towards Mitigating Hallucinations in Generative Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14367)
*Weiming Ren,Raghav Goyal,Zhiming Hu,Tristan Ty Aumentado-Armstrong,Iqbal Mohomed,Alex Levinshtein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种衡量和减少生成超分辨率（GSR）模型中幻觉（即生成细节与低分辨率图像或真实图像不匹配）的方法，通过多模态大语言模型（MLLM）生成“幻觉分数”（HS），并利用深度特征距离作为可微奖励函数来优化模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GSR模型在感知图像质量上表现优异，但存在幻觉问题，即生成细节与输入或真实图像不匹配，这一问题未被充分研究且限制了实际应用。

Method: 利用MLLM构建提示来评估幻觉视觉元素并生成HS，同时发现某些深度特征距离与HS强相关，提出将这些特征作为可微奖励函数来优化GSR模型。

Result: HS与人类评估高度一致，并为现有超分辨率模型指标提供了补充信息。

Conclusion: 通过HS和深度特征距离优化GSR模型，可以有效减少幻觉问题，提升模型的实用性和可靠性。

Abstract: Generative super-resolution (GSR) currently sets the state-of-the-art in
terms of perceptual image quality, overcoming the "regression-to-the-mean" blur
of prior non-generative models. However, from a human perspective, such models
do not fully conform to the optimal balance between quality and fidelity.
Instead, a different class of artifacts, in which generated details fail to
perceptually match the low resolution image (LRI) or ground-truth image (GTI),
is a critical but under studied issue in GSR, limiting its practical
deployments. In this work, we focus on measuring, analyzing, and mitigating
these artifacts (i.e., "hallucinations"). We observe that hallucinations are
not well-characterized with existing image metrics or quality models, as they
are orthogonal to both exact fidelity and no-reference quality. Instead, we
take advantage of a multimodal large language model (MLLM) by constructing a
prompt that assesses hallucinatory visual elements and generates a
"Hallucination Score" (HS). We find that our HS is closely aligned with human
evaluations, and also provides complementary insights to prior image metrics
used for super-resolution (SR) models. In addition, we find certain deep
feature distances have strong correlations with HS. We therefore propose to
align the GSR models by using such features as differentiable reward functions
to mitigate hallucinations.

### [6] [DUSTrack: Semi-automated point tracking in ultrasound videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14368)
*Praneeth Namburi,Roger Pallarès-López,Jessica Rosendorf,Duarte Folgado,Brian W. Anthony*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DUSTrack是一个结合深度学习和光流的半自动化工具包，用于B型超声视频中的点跟踪，解决了噪声和运动模糊等问题，并在多种应用中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: B型超声中的组织运动跟踪因噪声和低对比度等问题具有挑战性，需要一种通用且高精度的解决方案。

Method: 结合深度学习和光流技术，提供图形界面支持数据生成和模型优化，并引入光流滤波减少噪声。

Result: DUSTrack在精度上优于零样本跟踪器，与专用方法相当，适用于心脏、肌肉等多场景。

Conclusion: DUSTrack是一个开源、通用的工具，为临床和生物力学研究提供了强大的组织运动量化框架。

Abstract: Ultrasound technology enables safe, non-invasive imaging of dynamic tissue
behavior, making it a valuable tool in medicine, biomechanics, and sports
science. However, accurately tracking tissue motion in B-mode ultrasound
remains challenging due to speckle noise, low edge contrast, and out-of-plane
movement. These challenges complicate the task of tracking anatomical landmarks
over time, which is essential for quantifying tissue dynamics in many clinical
and research applications. This manuscript introduces DUSTrack (Deep learning
and optical flow-based toolkit for UltraSound Tracking), a semi-automated
framework for tracking arbitrary points in B-mode ultrasound videos. We combine
deep learning with optical flow to deliver high-quality and robust tracking
across diverse anatomical structures and motion patterns. The toolkit includes
a graphical user interface that streamlines the generation of high-quality
training data and supports iterative model refinement. It also implements a
novel optical-flow-based filtering technique that reduces high-frequency
frame-to-frame noise while preserving rapid tissue motion. DUSTrack
demonstrates superior accuracy compared to contemporary zero-shot point
trackers and performs on par with specialized methods, establishing its
potential as a general and foundational tool for clinical and biomechanical
research. We demonstrate DUSTrack's versatility through three use cases:
cardiac wall motion tracking in echocardiograms, muscle deformation analysis
during reaching tasks, and fascicle tracking during ankle plantarflexion. As an
open-source solution, DUSTrack offers a powerful, flexible framework for point
tracking to quantify tissue motion from ultrasound videos. DUSTrack is
available at https://github.com/praneethnamburi/DUSTrack.

*Zhou Chen,Joe Lin,Sathyanarayanan N. Aakur*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CRAFT是一个神经符号框架，用于可解释的affordance grounding，通过结合ConceptNet的常识先验和CLIP的视觉证据，迭代优化预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决场景理解中对象与动作关联的可解释性问题，提升准确性和透明度。

Method: 整合ConceptNet的符号化常识和CLIP的视觉信息，通过基于能量的推理循环迭代优化预测。

Result: 在无标签多对象场景中，CRAFT提高了准确性和可解释性。

Conclusion: CRAFT为稳健且可信的场景理解提供了新方向。

Abstract: We introduce CRAFT, a neuro-symbolic framework for interpretable affordance
grounding, which identifies the objects in a scene that enable a given action
(e.g., "cut"). CRAFT integrates structured commonsense priors from ConceptNet
and language models with visual evidence from CLIP, using an energy-based
reasoning loop to refine predictions iteratively. This process yields
transparent, goal-driven decisions to ground symbolic and perceptual
structures. Experiments in multi-object, label-free settings demonstrate that
CRAFT enhances accuracy while improving interpretability, providing a step
toward robust and trustworthy scene understanding.

### [8] [Adaptive 3D Gaussian Splatting Video Streaming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14432)
*Han Gong,Qiyue Li,Zhi Liu,Hao Zhou,Peng Yuan Zhou,Zhu Li,Jie Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于高斯变形场的3DGS视频流媒体框架，通过混合显著性分块和差异化质量建模，实现了高效压缩和带宽适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯溅射（3DGS）视频数据量大且压缩传输复杂，传统方法难以满足流媒体需求。

Method: 设计基于高斯变形场的3DGS视频构建方法，结合混合显著性分块和差异化质量建模。

Result: 实验验证了该方法在视频质量、压缩效率和传输速率上的优越性。

Conclusion: 该框架为3DGS视频流媒体提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The advent of 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has significantly enhanced the
quality of volumetric video representation. Meanwhile, in contrast to
conventional volumetric video, 3DGS video poses significant challenges for
streaming due to its substantially larger data volume and the heightened
complexity involved in compression and transmission. To address these issues,
we introduce an innovative framework for 3DGS volumetric video streaming.
Specifically, we design a 3DGS video construction method based on the Gaussian
deformation field. By employing hybrid saliency tiling and differentiated
quality modeling of 3DGS video, we achieve efficient data compression and
adaptation to bandwidth fluctuations while ensuring high transmission quality.
Then we build a complete 3DGS video streaming system and validate the
transmission performance. Through experimental evaluation, our method
demonstrated superiority over existing approaches in various aspects, including
video quality, compression effectiveness, and transmission rate.

### [9] [IRGPT: Understanding Real-world Infrared Image with Bi-cross-modal Curriculum on Large-scale Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14449)
*Zhe Cao,Jin Zhang,Ruiheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IRGPT是首个针对真实红外图像的多模态大语言模型，基于26万对真实红外图像-文本数据集（IR-TD），通过双跨模态课程迁移学习策略，在9项任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法依赖合成红外图像的局限性，以及真实红外图像与文本对齐数据稀缺的问题。

Method: 构建IR-TD数据集，结合LLM生成和规则标注的文本；提出双跨模态课程迁移学习策略，从可见光到红外域迁移知识。

Result: 在9项任务中达到最先进性能，优于更大规模的模型。

Conclusion: IRGPT通过真实数据集和创新学习策略，显著提升了红外图像多模态任务的性能。

Abstract: Real-world infrared imagery presents unique challenges for vision-language
models due to the scarcity of aligned text data and domain-specific
characteristics. Although existing methods have advanced the field, their
reliance on synthetic infrared images generated through style transfer from
visible images, which limits their ability to capture the unique
characteristics of the infrared modality. To address this, we propose IRGPT,
the first multi-modal large language model for real-world infrared images,
built upon a large-scale InfraRed-Text Dataset (IR-TD) comprising over 260K
authentic image-text pairs. The proposed IR-TD dataset contains real infrared
images paired with meticulously handcrafted texts, where the initial drafts
originated from two complementary processes: (1) LLM-generated descriptions of
visible images, and (2) rule-based descriptions of annotations. Furthermore, we
introduce a bi-cross-modal curriculum transfer learning strategy that
systematically transfers knowledge from visible to infrared domains by
considering the difficulty scores of both infrared-visible and infrared-text.
Evaluated on a benchmark of 9 tasks (e.g., recognition, grounding), IRGPT
achieves state-of-the-art performance even compared with larger-scale models.

*Weikang Gu,Mingyue Han,Li Xue,Heng Dong,Changcai Yang,Riqing Chen,Lifang Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Gestalt原则的并行交互网络（GPI-Net），用于点云配准中的高质量对应关系识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决局部和全局特征融合中的冗余和复杂空间关系问题。

Method: 利用Gestalt原则设计正交几何一致性策略，结合Gestalt特征注意力块（GFA）和双路径多粒度并行交互聚合块（DMG）。

Result: 在多个挑战性任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GPI-Net通过Gestalt原则优化特征融合，显著提升了点云配准的准确性。

Abstract: The accurate identification of high-quality correspondences is a prerequisite
task in feature-based point cloud registration. However, it is extremely
challenging to handle the fusion of local and global features due to feature
redundancy and complex spatial relationships. Given that Gestalt principles
provide key advantages in analyzing local and global relationships, we propose
a novel Gestalt-guided Parallel Interaction Network via orthogonal geometric
consistency (GPI-Net) in this paper. It utilizes Gestalt principles to
facilitate complementary communication between local and global information.
Specifically, we introduce an orthogonal integration strategy to optimally
reduce redundant information and generate a more compact global structure for
high-quality correspondences. To capture geometric features in correspondences,
we leverage a Gestalt Feature Attention (GFA) block through a hybrid
utilization of self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms. Furthermore, to
facilitate the integration of local detail information into the global
structure, we design an innovative Dual-path Multi-Granularity parallel
interaction aggregation (DMG) block to promote information exchange across
different granularities. Extensive experiments on various challenging tasks
demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed GPI-Net in comparison to
existing methods. The code will be released at https://github.com/gwk/GPI-Net.

Result: 实验表明，所提方法在性能上显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 本文为3DGS流媒体的关键挑战提供了全面解决方案，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting video (3DGS) streaming has recently emerged as a
research hotspot in both academia and industry, owing to its impressive ability
to deliver immersive 3D video experiences. However, research in this area is
still in its early stages, and several fundamental challenges, such as tiling,
quality assessment, and bitrate adaptation, require further investigation. In
this paper, we tackle these challenges by proposing a comprehensive set of
solutions. Specifically, we propose an adaptive 3DGS tiling technique guided by
saliency analysis, which integrates both spatial and temporal features. Each
tile is encoded into versions possessing dedicated deformation fields and
multiple quality levels for adaptive selection. We also introduce a novel
quality assessment framework for 3DGS video that jointly evaluates
spatial-domain degradation in 3DGS representations during streaming and the
quality of the resulting 2D rendered images. Additionally, we develop a
meta-learning-based adaptive bitrate algorithm specifically tailored for 3DGS
video streaming, achieving optimal performance across varying network
conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approaches
significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GEMINUS提出了一种混合专家框架，结合全局专家和场景自适应专家，通过双感知路由器动态激活模块，提升自动驾驶的适应性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单模式规划方法难以处理多样化场景，需要一种能适应复杂交通环境的自动驾驶框架。

Method: GEMINUS包含全局专家、场景自适应专家组和双感知路由器，通过动态激活专家模块实现多样化驾驶技能。

Result: 在Bench2Drive基准测试中表现优异，驾驶分数和成功率均达到最优，单目视觉输入下仍有显著提升。

Conclusion: GEMINUS通过混合专家框架显著提升了自动驾驶的适应性和性能，为复杂场景提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving requires adaptive and robust handling of
complex and diverse traffic environments. However, prevalent single-mode
planning methods attempt to learn an overall policy while struggling to acquire
diversified driving skills to handle diverse scenarios. Therefore, this paper
proposes GEMINUS, a Mixture-of-Experts end-to-end autonomous driving framework
featuring a Global Expert, a Scene-Adaptive Experts Group, and equipped with a
Dual-aware Router. Specifically, the Global Expert is trained on the overall
dataset, possessing robust performance. The Scene-Adaptive Experts are trained
on corresponding scene subsets, achieving adaptive performance. The Dual-aware
Router simultaneously considers scenario-level features and routing uncertainty
to dynamically activate expert modules. Through the effective coupling of the
Global Expert and the Scene-Adaptive Experts Group via the Dual-aware Router,
GEMINUS achieves adaptive and robust performance in diverse scenarios. GEMINUS
outperforms existing methods in the Bench2Drive closed-loop benchmark and
achieves state-of-the-art performance in Driving Score and Success Rate, even
with only monocular vision input. Furthermore, ablation studies demonstrate
significant improvements over the original single-expert baseline: 7.67% in
Driving Score, 22.06% in Success Rate, and 19.41% in MultiAbility-Mean. The
code will be available at https://github.com/newbrains1/GEMINUS.

*Huayuan Ye,Juntong Chen,Shenzhuo Zhang,Yipeng Zhang,Changbo Wang,Chenhui Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisGuard是一个抗篡改的可视化图像数据检索框架，通过嵌入元数据链接解决现有方法在图像篡改时的脆弱性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在可视化图像传播中易受篡改影响，导致元数据丢失，VisGuard旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用重复数据平铺、可逆信息广播和基于锚点的裁剪定位技术，增强嵌入数据的鲁棒性。

Result: VisGuard在数据检索准确性、嵌入容量和抗篡改能力方面表现优异。

Conclusion: VisGuard能有效保护和促进可视化传播及信息传递。

Abstract: The dissemination of visualizations is primarily in the form of raster
images, which often results in the loss of critical information such as source
code, interactive features, and metadata. While previous methods have proposed
embedding metadata into images to facilitate Visualization Image Data Retrieval
(VIDR), most existing methods lack practicability since they are fragile to
common image tampering during online distribution such as cropping and editing.
To address this issue, we propose VisGuard, a tamper-resistant VIDR framework
that reliably embeds metadata link into visualization images. The embedded data
link remains recoverable even after substantial tampering upon images. We
propose several techniques to enhance robustness, including repetitive data
tiling, invertible information broadcasting, and an anchor-based scheme for
crop localization. VisGuard enables various applications, including interactive
chart reconstruction, tampering detection, and copyright protection. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on VisGuard's superior performance in data retrieval
accuracy, embedding capacity, and security against tampering and steganalysis,
demonstrating VisGuard's competence in facilitating and safeguarding
visualization dissemination and information conveyance.

*Zhenyu Li,Tianyi Shang,Pengjie Xu,Ruirui Zhang,Fanchen Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OptiCorNet提出了一种新颖的序列建模框架，结合空间特征提取和时间差分，通过端到端训练提升动态环境中的视觉地点识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态和感知混淆环境中的视觉地点识别（VPR）是长期定位的核心挑战，现有方法多忽略时间连贯性。

Method: OptiCorNet采用轻量级1D卷积编码器和可学习的差分时间算子（DSD），结合LSTM和四重损失优化。

Result: 在多个公开基准测试中，OptiCorNet在季节和视角变化下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: OptiCorNet通过端到端学习序列级嵌入，显著提升了动态环境中的地点识别效果。

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) in dynamic and perceptually aliased
environments remains a fundamental challenge for long-term localization.
Existing deep learning-based solutions predominantly focus on single-frame
embeddings, neglecting the temporal coherence present in image sequences. This
paper presents OptiCorNet, a novel sequence modeling framework that unifies
spatial feature extraction and temporal differencing into a differentiable,
end-to-end trainable module. Central to our approach is a lightweight 1D
convolutional encoder combined with a learnable differential temporal operator,
termed Differentiable Sequence Delta (DSD), which jointly captures short-term
spatial context and long-range temporal transitions. The DSD module models
directional differences across sequences via a fixed-weight differencing
kernel, followed by an LSTM-based refinement and optional residual projection,
yielding compact, discriminative descriptors robust to viewpoint and appearance
shifts. To further enhance inter-class separability, we incorporate a
quadruplet loss that optimizes both positive alignment and multi-negative
divergence within each batch. Unlike prior VPR methods that treat temporal
aggregation as post-processing, OptiCorNet learns sequence-level embeddings
directly, enabling more effective end-to-end place recognition. Comprehensive
evaluations on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under challenging seasonal and viewpoint
variations.

### [15] [DFQ-ViT: Data-Free Quantization for Vision Transformers without Fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14481)
*Yujia Tong,Jingling Yuan,Tian Zhang,Jianquan Liu,Chuang Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DFQ-ViT提出了一种无需数据的ViT量化方法，通过合成高质量样本和激活校正矩阵，显著提升了量化模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在合成样本时未能平衡全局和局部特征，且量化模型与全精度模型的中间层激活分布差异大，导致性能下降。

Method: 按难度递增顺序合成样本，并引入激活校正矩阵对齐量化模型与全精度模型的中间层激活。

Result: DFQ-ViT性能优于现有DFQ方法，接近真实数据量化模型，如3位量化DeiT-T性能提升4.29%。

Conclusion: DFQ-ViT无需微调，降低计算开销和部署门槛，符合绿色学习原则，适用于资源受限环境。

Abstract: Data-Free Quantization (DFQ) enables the quantization of Vision Transformers
(ViTs) without requiring access to data, allowing for the deployment of ViTs on
devices with limited resources. In DFQ, the quantization model must be
calibrated using synthetic samples, making the quality of these synthetic
samples crucial. Existing methods fail to fully capture and balance the global
and local features within the samples, resulting in limited synthetic data
quality. Moreover, we have found that during inference, there is a significant
difference in the distributions of intermediate layer activations between the
quantized and full-precision models. These issues lead to a severe performance
degradation of the quantized model. To address these problems, we propose a
pipeline for Data-Free Quantization for Vision Transformers (DFQ-ViT).
Specifically, we synthesize samples in order of increasing difficulty,
effectively enhancing the quality of synthetic data. During the calibration and
inference stage, we introduce the activation correction matrix for the
quantized model to align the intermediate layer activations with those of the
full-precision model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DFQ-ViT achieves
remarkable superiority over existing DFQ methods and its performance is on par
with models quantized through real data. For example, the performance of DeiT-T
with 3-bit weights quantization is 4.29% higher than the state-of-the-art. Our
method eliminates the need for fine-tuning, which not only reduces
computational overhead but also lowers the deployment barriers for edge
devices. This characteristic aligns with the principles of Green Learning by

*Hongye Hou,Liu Zhan,Yang Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于检索增强的点云补全框架，通过跨模态检索学习结构先验信息，生成精细点云。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决不完整点云补全任务中缺乏典型结构特征的挑战，并提升生成能力和泛化性。

Method: 设计了结构共享特征编码器（SSFE）和渐进检索增强生成器（PRAG），结合跨模态检索和层次特征融合。

Result: 在多个数据集和真实场景中验证了方法的有效性，能够生成精细点云并处理稀疏数据和未见类别。

Conclusion: 该方法通过检索增强和层次融合显著提升了点云补全的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Completing the whole 3D structure based on an incomplete point cloud is a
challenging task, particularly when the residual point cloud lacks typical
structural characteristics. Recent methods based on cross-modal learning
attempt to introduce instance images to aid the structure feature learning.
However, they still focus on each particular input class, limiting their
generation abilities. In this work, we propose a novel retrieval-augmented
point cloud completion framework. The core idea is to incorporate cross-modal
retrieval into completion task to learn structural prior information from
similar reference samples. Specifically, we design a Structural Shared Feature
Encoder (SSFE) to jointly extract cross-modal features and reconstruct
reference features as priors. Benefiting from a dual-channel control gate in
the encoder, relevant structural features in the reference sample are enhanced
and irrelevant information interference is suppressed. In addition, we propose
a Progressive Retrieval-Augmented Generator (PRAG) that employs a hierarchical
feature fusion mechanism to integrate reference prior information with input
features from global to local. Through extensive evaluations on multiple
datasets and real-world scenes, our method shows its effectiveness in
generating fine-grained point clouds, as well as its generalization capability
in handling sparse data and unseen categories.

### [17] [Efficient Whole Slide Pathology VQA via Token Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14497)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TCP-LLaVA是一种新型多模态大语言模型，通过令牌压缩技术解决病理学全切片图像的视觉问答问题，显著降低计算成本并提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 病理学全切片图像（WSI）的高分辨率和长上下文长度对多模态大语言模型（MLLM）提出了挑战，现有方法在生成能力和资源消耗上存在不足。

Method: 提出TCP-LLaVA，通过可训练的压缩令牌和模态压缩模块，仅将压缩后的令牌输入语言模型，减少输入长度和计算成本。

Result: 在十种TCGA肿瘤亚型的实验中，TCP-LLaVA在VQA准确性上优于现有基线，并大幅降低训练资源消耗。

Conclusion: TCP-LLaVA为WSI的视觉问答提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Whole-slide images (WSIs) in pathology can reach up to 10,000 x 10,000
pixels, posing significant challenges for multimodal large language model
(MLLM) due to long context length and high computational demands. Previous
methods typically focus on patch-level analysis or slide-level classification
using CLIP-based models with multi-instance learning, but they lack the
generative capabilities needed for visual question answering (VQA). More recent
MLLM-based approaches address VQA by feeding thousands of patch tokens directly
into the language model, which leads to excessive resource consumption. To
address these limitations, we propose Token Compression Pathology LLaVA
(TCP-LLaVA), the first MLLM architecture to perform WSI VQA via token
compression. TCP-LLaVA introduces a set of trainable compression tokens that
aggregate visual and textual information through a modality compression module,
inspired by the [CLS] token mechanism in BERT. Only the compressed tokens are
forwarded to the LLM for answer generation, significantly reducing input length
and computational cost. Experiments on ten TCGA tumor subtypes show that
TCP-LLaVA outperforms existing MLLM baselines in VQA accuracy while reducing
training resource consumption by a substantial margin.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖光流或深度估计，而神经形态传感器的事件数据稀疏且高时间分辨率，需开发新方法以充分利用其特性。

Method: 利用几何约束结合法向流、场景结构和惯性测量，通过优化流程进行事件过分割、残差分析分离运动物体，并基于运动相似性和时间一致性进行层次聚类优化分割。

Result: 在EVIMO2v2数据集上验证了方法的高精度分割与平移运动估计能力，尤其在物体边界表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法在实时机器人及导航应用中具有显著潜力，且无需完整光流计算，更具可扩展性。

Abstract: This paper introduces a robust framework for motion segmentation and
egomotion estimation using event-based normal flow, tailored specifically for
neuromorphic vision sensors. In contrast to traditional methods that rely
heavily on optical flow or explicit depth estimation, our approach exploits the
sparse, high-temporal-resolution event data and incorporates geometric
constraints between normal flow, scene structure, and inertial measurements.
The proposed optimization-based pipeline iteratively performs event
over-segmentation, isolates independently moving objects via residual analysis,
and refines segmentations using hierarchical clustering informed by motion
similarity and temporal consistency. Experimental results on the EVIMO2v2
dataset validate that our method achieves accurate segmentation and
translational motion estimation without requiring full optical flow
computation. This approach demonstrates significant advantages at object
boundaries and offers considerable potential for scalable, real-time robotic
and navigation applications.

Radiance Fields (NeRF), etc. We examine key tasks such as pose-free
reconstruction, dynamic 3D reconstruction, and 3D-aware image and video
synthesis, highlighting their applications in digital humans, SLAM, robotics,
and beyond. In addition, we review commonly used datasets with detailed
statistics, along with evaluation protocols for various downstream tasks. We
conclude by discussing open research challenges and promising directions for
future work, emphasizing the potential of feed-forward approaches to advance

Conclusion: DCHM为多视图行人检测提供了一种高效且无需人工标注的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Multiview pedestrian detection typically involves two stages: human modeling
and pedestrian localization. Human modeling represents pedestrians in 3D space
by fusing multiview information, making its quality crucial for detection
accuracy. However, existing methods often introduce noise and have low
precision. While some approaches reduce noise by fitting on costly multiview 3D
annotations, they often struggle to generalize across diverse scenes. To
eliminate reliance on human-labeled annotations and accurately model humans, we
propose Depth-Consistent Human Modeling (DCHM), a framework designed for
consistent depth estimation and multiview fusion in global coordinates.
Specifically, our proposed pipeline with superpixel-wise Gaussian Splatting
achieves multiview depth consistency in sparse-view, large-scaled, and crowded
scenarios, producing precise point clouds for pedestrian localization.
Extensive validations demonstrate that our method significantly reduces noise
during human modeling, outperforming previous state-of-the-art baselines.
Additionally, to our knowledge, DCHM is the first to reconstruct pedestrians
and perform multiview segmentation in such a challenging setting. Code is
available on the \href{https://jiahao-ma.github.io/DCHM/}{project page}.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of educational applications, artistic creation, and
AI-generated content (AIGC) technologies has substantially increased practical
requirements for comprehensive Image Aesthetics Assessment (IAA), particularly
demanding methods capable of delivering both quantitative scoring and
professional understanding. Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based IAA

Expert-Level Understanding capabilities; (2) ArtiMuse-10K, the first
expert-curated image aesthetic dataset comprising 10,000 images spanning 5 main
categories and 15 subcategories, each annotated by professional experts with
8-dimensional attributes analysis and a holistic score. Both the model and
dataset will be made public to advance the field.

Abstract: It has always been a rather tough task to communicate with someone possessing
a hearing impairment. One of the most tested ways to establish such a
communication is through the use of sign based languages. However, not many
people are aware of the smaller intricacies involved with sign language. Sign
language recognition using computer vision aims at eliminating the
communication barrier between deaf-mute and ordinary people so that they can
properly communicate with others. Recently the pandemic has left the whole
world shaken up and has transformed the way we communicate. Video meetings have
become essential for everyone, even people with a hearing disability. In recent
studies, it has been found that people with hearing disabilities prefer to sign
over typing during these video calls. In this paper, we are proposing a browser
extension that will automatically translate sign language to subtitles for
everyone else in the video call. The Large-scale dataset which contains more
than 2000 Word-Level ASL videos, which were performed by over 100 signers will
be used.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决情感认知科学中外部情感刺激与人类内部体验关系建模的挑战，尤其是ANN在个体差异建模上的不足。

Method: 提出一种新颖的感知边界采样方法，生成ANN决策边界上的模糊表情刺激，构建varEmotion数据集，并通过大规模人类行为实验验证。

Result: ANN模糊的刺激导致人类感知不确定性增加，表明情感感知存在共享的计算原则。通过行为数据微调ANN，实现了ANN预测与人类群体及个体感知模式的对齐。

Conclusion: 研究建立了ANN决策边界与人类感知变异性之间的系统性联系，为情感解释的个性化建模提供了新视角。

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in affective cognitive science is to develop models
that accurately capture the relationship between external emotional stimuli and
human internal experiences. While ANNs have demonstrated remarkable accuracy in
facial expression recognition, their ability to model inter-individual
differences in human perception remains underexplored. This study investigates
the phenomenon of high perceptual variability-where individuals exhibit
significant differences in emotion categorization even when viewing the same
stimulus. Inspired by the similarity between ANNs and human perception, we
hypothesize that facial expression samples that are ambiguous for ANN
classifiers also elicit divergent perceptual judgments among human observers.
To examine this hypothesis, we introduce a novel perceptual boundary sampling
method to generate facial expression stimuli that lie along ANN decision
boundaries. These ambiguous samples form the basis of the varEmotion dataset,
constructed through large-scale human behavioral experiments. Our analysis
reveals that these ANN-confusing stimuli also provoke heightened perceptual
uncertainty in human participants, highlighting shared computational principles
in emotion perception. Finally, by fine-tuning ANN representations using
behavioral data, we achieve alignment between ANN predictions and both
group-level and individual-level human perceptual patterns. Our findings
establish a systematic link between ANN decision boundaries and human
perceptual variability, offering new insights into personalized modeling of
emotional interpretation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 照片中的杂乱内容会分散注意力，影响情感或故事的传达，业余摄影师常因疏忽或经验不足而未能避免。

Method: 系统通过美学评估算法区分杂乱对象，并提供交互式工具和基于生成对抗网络的图像修复算法去除杂乱。

Result: 用户研究表明，系统能帮助用户更高效地识别杂乱并提升照片质量。

Conclusion: 该系统通过灵活界面和精准算法，有效帮助用户改善摄影作品。

Abstract: Clutter in photos is a distraction preventing photographers from conveying
the intended emotions or stories to the audience. Photography amateurs
frequently include clutter in their photos due to unconscious negligence or the
lack of experience in creating a decluttered, aesthetically appealing scene for
shooting. We are thus motivated to develop a camera guidance system that
provides solutions and guidance for clutter identification and removal. We
estimate and visualize the contribution of objects to the overall aesthetics
and content of a photo, based on which users can interactively identify
clutter. Suggestions on getting rid of clutter, as well as a tool that removes
cluttered objects computationally, are provided to guide users to deal with
different kinds of clutter and improve their photographic work. Two technical
novelties underpin interactions in our system: a clutter distinguishment
algorithm with aesthetics evaluations for objects and an iterative image
inpainting algorithm based on generative adversarial nets that reconstructs
missing regions of removed objects for high-resolution images. User studies
demonstrate that our system provides flexible interfaces and accurate
algorithms that allow users to better identify distractions and take higher
quality images within less time.

Result: 在五个基准数据集（ScanRefer等）上，Descrip3D表现优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 语言引导的关系表示能有效理解复杂室内场景。

Abstract: Understanding 3D scenes goes beyond simply recognizing objects; it requires
reasoning about the spatial and semantic relationships between them. Current 3D
scene-language models often struggle with this relational understanding,
particularly when visual embeddings alone do not adequately convey the roles
and interactions of objects. In this paper, we introduce Descrip3D, a novel and
powerful framework that explicitly encodes the relationships between objects
using natural language. Unlike previous methods that rely only on 2D and 3D
embeddings, Descrip3D enhances each object with a textual description that
captures both its intrinsic attributes and contextual relationships. These
relational cues are incorporated into the model through a dual-level
integration: embedding fusion and prompt-level injection. This allows for
unified reasoning across various tasks such as grounding, captioning, and
question answering, all without the need for task-specific heads or additional
supervision. When evaluated on five benchmark datasets, including ScanRefer,
Multi3DRefer, ScanQA, SQA3D, and Scan2Cap, Descrip3D consistently outperforms
strong baseline models, demonstrating the effectiveness of language-guided
relational representation for understanding complex indoor scenes.

Conclusion: LEAD通过单步优化有效弥合优化差距，避免了冗长的微调过程，展示了其在模型迁移性能预测中的高效性。

Abstract: The remarkable success of pretrain-then-finetune paradigm has led to a
proliferation of available pre-trained models for vision tasks. This surge
presents a significant challenge in efficiently choosing the most suitable
pre-trained models for downstream tasks. The critical aspect of this challenge
lies in effectively predicting the model transferability by considering the
underlying fine-tuning dynamics. Existing methods often model fine-tuning
dynamics in feature space with linear transformations, which do not precisely
align with the fine-tuning objective and fail to grasp the essential
nonlinearity from optimization. To this end, we present LEAD, a
finetuning-aligned approach based on the network output of logits. LEAD
proposes a theoretical framework to model the optimization process and derives
an ordinary differential equation (ODE) to depict the nonlinear evolution
toward the final logit state. Additionally, we design a class-aware
decomposition method to consider the varying evolution dynamics across classes
and further ensure practical applicability. Integrating the closely aligned
optimization objective and nonlinear modeling capabilities derived from the
differential equation, our method offers a concise solution to effectively
bridge the optimization gap in a single step, bypassing the lengthy fine-tuning
process. The comprehensive experiments on 24 supervised and self-supervised
pre-trained models across 10 downstream datasets demonstrate impressive
performances and showcase its broad adaptability even in low-data scenarios.

Result: GAN-based Pix2Pix模型表现最佳，流匹配模型在小数据集上容易过拟合。

Conclusion: GAN更适合实际MRI工作流，未来研究可探索更多数据以提升流匹配性能。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) enables the acquisition of multiple image
contrasts, such as T1-weighted (T1w) and T2-weighted (T2w) scans, each offering
distinct diagnostic insights. However, acquiring all desired modalities
increases scan time and cost, motivating research into computational methods
for cross-modal synthesis. To address this, recent approaches aim to synthesize
missing MRI contrasts from those already acquired, reducing acquisition time
while preserving diagnostic quality. Image-to-image (I2I) translation provides
a promising framework for this task. In this paper, we present a comprehensive
benchmark of generative models$\unicode{x2013}$specifically, Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs), diffusion models, and flow matching (FM)
techniques$\unicode{x2013}$for T1w-to-T2w 2D MRI I2I translation. All
frameworks are implemented with comparable settings and evaluated on three
publicly available MRI datasets of healthy adults. Our quantitative and
qualitative analyses show that the GAN-based Pix2Pix model outperforms
diffusion and FM-based methods in terms of structural fidelity, image quality,
and computational efficiency. Consistent with existing literature, these
results suggest that flow-based models are prone to overfitting on small
datasets and simpler tasks, and may require more data to match or surpass GAN
performance. These findings offer practical guidance for deploying I2I
translation techniques in real-world MRI workflows and highlight promising
directions for future research in cross-modal medical image synthesis. Code and
models are publicly available at

Abstract: Medical imaging plays a vital role in early disease diagnosis and monitoring.
Specifically, blood microscopy offers valuable insights into blood cell
morphology and the detection of hematological disorders. In recent years, deep
learning-based automated classification systems have demonstrated high

classifying blood cell images from the publicly available BloodMNIST dataset.
The study primarily focuses on inference time differences, but also
classification performance for different image sizes. The results reveal
variations in performance across frameworks, influenced by factors such as
image resolution and framework-specific optimizations. Classification accuracy
for JAX and PyTorch was comparable to current benchmarks, showcasing the
efficiency of these frameworks for medical image classification.

medical analysis, etc. Since the structure of facial attributes varies with
facial expressions, incorporating structural information into facial attributes
is essential for facial expression recognition. In this paper, we propose
Exp-Graph, a novel framework designed to represent the structural relationships
among facial attributes using graph-based modeling for facial expression
recognition. For facial attributes graph representation, facial landmarks are
used as the graph's vertices. At the same time, the edges are determined based
on the proximity of the facial landmark and the similarity of the local
appearance of the facial attributes encoded using the vision transformer.
Additionally, graph convolutional networks are utilized to capture and
integrate these structural dependencies into the encoding of facial attributes,
thereby enhancing the accuracy of expression recognition. Thus, Exp-Graph
learns from the facial attribute graphs highly expressive semantic
representations. On the other hand, the vision transformer and graph
convolutional blocks help the framework exploit the local and global
dependencies among the facial attributes that are essential for the recognition
of facial expressions. We conducted comprehensive evaluations of the proposed
Exp-Graph model on three benchmark datasets: Oulu-CASIA, eNTERFACE05, and AFEW.
The model achieved recognition accuracies of 98.09\%, 79.01\%, and 56.39\%,
respectively. These results indicate that Exp-Graph maintains strong
generalization capabilities across both controlled laboratory settings and
real-world, unconstrained environments, underscoring its effectiveness for
practical facial expression recognition applications.

TL;DR: DD-SAM2是一种高效适配框架，通过Depthwise-Dilated Adapter增强SAM2的多尺度特征提取，适用于医学视频分割与跟踪，性能优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学图像分割方法多为模态专用设计，适应性差，且SAM2及其变种在医学视频场景中需大规模数据集重新训练，计算成本高且易遗忘。

Method: 提出DD-SAM2框架，引入DD-Adapter以最小参数开销增强多尺度特征提取，支持小规模数据微调SAM2。

Result: 在TrackRad2025和EchoNet-Dynamic数据集上分别达到Dice分数0.93和0.97，性能优越。

Conclusion: DD-SAM2首次系统探索了基于适配器的SAM2微调方法，为医学视频分割与跟踪提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in medical image segmentation have been driven by deep
learning; however, most existing methods remain limited by modality-specific
designs and exhibit poor adaptability to dynamic medical imaging scenarios. The
Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) and its related variants, which introduce a
streaming memory mechanism for real-time video segmentation, present new
opportunities for prompt-based, generalizable solutions. Nevertheless, adapting
these models to medical video scenarios typically requires large-scale datasets
for retraining or transfer learning, leading to high computational costs and
the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, we propose
DD-SAM2, an efficient adaptation framework for SAM2 that incorporates a
Depthwise-Dilated Adapter (DD-Adapter) to enhance multi-scale feature
extraction with minimal parameter overhead. This design enables effective
fine-tuning of SAM2 on medical videos with limited training data. Unlike
existing adapter-based methods focused solely on static images, DD-SAM2 fully
exploits SAM2's streaming memory for medical video object tracking and
segmentation. Comprehensive evaluations on TrackRad2025 (tumor segmentation)
and EchoNet-Dynamic (left ventricle tracking) datasets demonstrate superior
performance, achieving Dice scores of 0.93 and 0.97, respectively. To the best
of our knowledge, this work provides an initial attempt at systematically
exploring adapter-based SAM2 fine-tuning for medical video segmentation and
tracking. Code, datasets, and models will be publicly available at

Result: BusterX++ 在跨模态检测中表现优异，GenBuster++ 基准测试验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: BusterX++ 为合成媒体检测提供了高效、可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI have dramatically improved image and video
synthesis capabilities, significantly increasing the risk of misinformation
through sophisticated fake content. In response, detection methods have evolved
from traditional approaches to multimodal large language models (MLLMs),
offering enhanced transparency and interpretability in identifying synthetic
media. However, current detection systems remain fundamentally limited by their
single-modality design. These approaches analyze images or videos separately,
making them ineffective against synthetic content that combines multiple media
formats. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{BusterX++}, a novel
framework designed specifically for cross-modal detection and explanation of
synthetic media. Our approach incorporates an advanced reinforcement learning
(RL) post-training strategy that eliminates cold-start. Through Multi-stage
Training, Thinking Reward, and Hybrid Reasoning, BusterX++ achieves stable and
substantial performance improvements. To enable comprehensive evaluation, we
also present \textbf{GenBuster++}, a cross-modal benchmark leveraging
state-of-the-art image and video generation techniques. This benchmark
comprises 4,000 images and video clips, meticulously curated by human experts
using a novel filtering methodology to ensure high quality, diversity, and
real-world applicability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
and generalizability of our approach.

TL;DR: MS2Fusion提出了一种基于状态空间模型的双路径参数交互机制，用于多光谱特征融合，解决了现有方法在局部互补特征和跨模态共享语义之间的平衡问题，并在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多光谱特征融合方法过度关注局部互补特征而忽视跨模态共享语义，且难以平衡感受野大小与计算复杂度，限制了其泛化性能和可扩展性。

Method: MS2Fusion通过双路径参数交互机制实现特征融合：一条路径通过跨模态隐藏状态解码挖掘互补信息，另一条路径通过参数共享探索跨模态对齐的语义特征。两者在状态空间模型下联合优化。

Result: 在FLIR、M3FD和LLVIP等基准测试中，MS2Fusion显著优于其他多光谱目标检测方法，并在RGB-T语义分割和RGBT显著目标检测任务中表现出泛化能力。

Conclusion: MS2Fusion通过双路径交互机制实现了高效且有效的多光谱特征融合，兼具功能互补性和共享语义空间，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Modern multispectral feature fusion for object detection faces two critical
limitations: (1) Excessive preference for local complementary features over
cross-modal shared semantics adversely affects generalization performance; and
(2) The trade-off between the receptive field size and computational complexity
present critical bottlenecks for scalable feature modeling. Addressing these
issues, a novel Multispectral State-Space Feature Fusion framework, dubbed
MS2Fusion, is proposed based on the state space model (SSM), achieving
efficient and effective fusion through a dual-path parametric interaction
mechanism. More specifically, the first cross-parameter interaction branch
inherits the advantage of cross-attention in mining complementary information
with cross-modal hidden state decoding in SSM. The second shared-parameter
branch explores cross-modal alignment with joint embedding to obtain
cross-modal similar semantic features and structures through parameter sharing
in SSM. Finally, these two paths are jointly optimized with SSM for fusing
multispectral features in a unified framework, allowing our MS2Fusion to enjoy
both functional complementarity and shared semantic space. In our extensive
experiments on mainstream benchmarks including FLIR, M3FD and LLVIP, our
MS2Fusion significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art multispectral object
detection methods, evidencing its superiority. Moreover, MS2Fusion is general
and applicable to other multispectral perception tasks. We show that, even
without specific design, MS2Fusion achieves state-of-the-art results on RGB-T
semantic segmentation and RGBT salient object detection, showing its
generality. The source code will be available at

Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into sports officiating
represents a paradigm shift in how decisions are made in competitive
environments. Traditional manual systems, even when supported by Instant Video
Replay (IVR), often suffer from latency, subjectivity, and inconsistent
enforcement, undermining fairness and athlete trust. This paper introduces
FST.ai, a novel AI-powered framework designed to enhance officiating in Sport
Taekwondo, particularly focusing on the complex task of real-time head kick
detection and scoring. Leveraging computer vision, deep learning, and edge
inference, the system automates the identification and classification of key
actions, significantly reducing decision time from minutes to seconds while
improving consistency and transparency. Importantly, the methodology is not
limited to Taekwondo. The underlying framework -- based on pose estimation,
motion classification, and impact analysis -- can be adapted to a wide range of
sports requiring action detection, such as judo, karate, fencing, or even team
sports like football and basketball, where foul recognition or performance
tracking is critical. By addressing one of Taekwondo's most challenging
scenarios -- head kick scoring -- we demonstrate the robustness, scalability,
and sport-agnostic potential of FST.ai to transform officiating standards
across multiple disciplines.

Abstract: Quantifying post-consumer food waste in institutional dining settings is
essential for supporting data-driven sustainability strategies. This study
presents a cost-effective computer vision framework that estimates plate-level
food waste by utilizing semantic segmentation of RGB images taken before and
after meal consumption across five Iranian dishes. Four fully supervised models
(U-Net, U-Net++, and their lightweight variants) were trained using a capped
dynamic inverse-frequency loss and AdamW optimizer, then evaluated through a
comprehensive set of metrics, including Pixel Accuracy, Dice, IoU, and a
custom-defined Distributional Pixel Agreement (DPA) metric tailored to the
task. All models achieved satisfying performance, and for each food type, at
least one model approached or surpassed 90% DPA, demonstrating strong alignment
in pixel-wise proportion estimates. Lighter models with reduced parameter
counts offered faster inference, achieving real-time throughput on an NVIDIA T4
GPU. Further analysis showed superior segmentation performance for dry and more
rigid components (e.g., rice and fries), while more complex, fragmented, or
viscous dishes, such as stews, showed reduced performance, specifically
post-consumption. Despite limitations such as reliance on 2D imaging,
constrained food variety, and manual data collection, the proposed framework is
pioneering and represents a scalable, contactless solution for continuous
monitoring of food consumption. This research lays foundational groundwork for
automated, real-time waste tracking systems in large-scale food service
environments and offers actionable insights and outlines feasible future
directions for dining hall management and policymakers aiming to reduce
institutional food waste.

Conclusion: Gene-DML通过学习鲁棒的跨模态表示，为精准医学和计算病理学提供了可扩展且非侵入性的分子分析工具。

Abstract: Accurately predicting gene expression from histopathology images offers a
scalable and non-invasive approach to molecular profiling, with significant
implications for precision medicine and computational pathology. However,
existing methods often underutilize the cross-modal representation alignment
between histopathology images and gene expression profiles across multiple
representational levels, thereby limiting their prediction performance. To
address this, we propose Gene-DML, a unified framework that structures latent
space through Dual-pathway Multi-Level discrimination to enhance correspondence
between morphological and transcriptional modalities. The multi-scale
instance-level discrimination pathway aligns hierarchical histopathology
representations extracted at local, neighbor, and global levels with gene
expression profiles, capturing scale-aware morphological-transcriptional
relationships. In parallel, the cross-level instance-group discrimination
pathway enforces structural consistency between individual (image/gene)
instances and modality-crossed (gene/image, respectively) groups, strengthening
the alignment across modalities. By jointly modelling fine-grained and
structural-level discrimination, Gene-DML is able to learn robust cross-modal
representations, enhancing both predictive accuracy and generalization across
diverse biological contexts. Extensive experiments on public spatial
transcriptomics datasets demonstrate that Gene-DML achieves state-of-the-art
performance in gene expression prediction. The code and checkpoints will be
released soon.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs),
their performance on complex, multi-page document comprehension remains
inadequate, largely due to the lack of high-quality, document-level datasets.
While current retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods offer partial
solutions, they suffer from issues, such as fragmented retrieval contexts,
multi-stage error accumulation, and extra time costs of retrieval. In this
work, we present a high-quality document-level dataset, Doc-750K, designed to
support in-depth understanding of multimodal documents. This dataset includes
diverse document structures, extensive cross-page dependencies, and real
question-answer pairs derived from the original documents. Building on the
dataset, we develop a native multimodal model, Docopilot, which can accurately
handle document-level dependencies without relying on RAG. Experiments
demonstrate that Docopilot achieves superior coherence, accuracy, and
efficiency in document understanding tasks and multi-turn interactions, setting
a new baseline for document-level multimodal understanding. Data, code, and

Abstract: Whole slide images (WSIs) are vital in digital pathology, enabling gigapixel
tissue analysis across various pathological tasks. While recent advancements in
multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) allow multi-task WSI analysis through
natural language, they often underperform compared to task-specific models.
Collaborative multi-agent systems have emerged as a promising solution to
balance versatility and accuracy in healthcare, yet their potential remains
underexplored in pathology-specific domains. To address these issues, we
propose WSI-Agents, a novel collaborative multi-agent system for multi-modal
WSI analysis. WSI-Agents integrates specialized functional agents with robust
task allocation and verification mechanisms to enhance both task-specific
accuracy and multi-task versatility through three components: (1) a task
allocation module assigning tasks to expert agents using a model zoo of patch
and WSI level MLLMs, (2) a verification mechanism ensuring accuracy through
internal consistency checks and external validation using pathology knowledge
bases and domain-specific models, and (3) a summary module synthesizing the
final summary with visual interpretation maps. Extensive experiments on
multi-modal WSI benchmarks show WSI-Agents's superiority to current WSI MLLMs
and medical agent frameworks across diverse tasks.

Method: 提出MIPD框架，利用LLM生成正负理性提示，通过NMPA模块对齐视觉信息，最终将知识蒸馏到学生Ov-GSR模型中。

Result: 在Ov-SWiG和HICO-DET数据集上，MIPD在可见、罕见和未见场景中均表现优异，提升了未见场景的检测能力。

Conclusion: MIPD通过知识蒸馏显著提升了小模型的泛化和零样本能力，为复杂GSR任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) exhibit strong zero-shot
abilities but struggle with complex Grounded Situation Recognition (GSR) and
are resource-intensive for edge device deployment. Meanwhile, conventional GSR
models often lack generalization ability, falling short in recognizing unseen
and rare situations. In this paper, we exploit transferring knowledge from a
teacher MLLM to a small GSR model to enhance its generalization and zero-shot
abilities, thereby introducing the task of Open-vocabulary Grounded Situation
Recognition (Ov-GSR). To achieve this, we propose Multimodal Interactive Prompt
Distillation (MIPD), a novel framework that distills enriched multimodal
knowledge from the foundation model, enabling the student Ov-GSR model to
recognize unseen situations and be better aware of rare situations.
Specifically, the MIPD framework first leverages the LLM-based Judgmental
Rationales Generator (JRG) to construct positive and negative glimpse and gaze
rationales enriched with contextual semantic information. The proposed
scene-aware and instance-perception prompts are then introduced to align
rationales with visual information from the MLLM teacher via the
Negative-Guided Multimodal Prompting Alignment (NMPA) module, effectively
capturing holistic and perceptual multimodal knowledge. Finally, the aligned
multimodal knowledge is distilled into the student Ov-GSR model, providing a
stronger foundation for generalization that enhances situation understanding,
bridges the gap between seen and unseen scenarios, and mitigates prediction
bias in rare cases. We evaluate MIPD on the refined Ov-SWiG dataset, achieving
superior performance on seen, rare, and unseen situations, and further
demonstrate improved unseen detection on the HICO-DET dataset.

Abstract: Agricultural parcels serve as basic units for conducting agricultural
practices and applications, which is vital for land ownership registration,
food security assessment, soil erosion monitoring, etc. However, existing
agriculture parcel extraction studies only focus on mid-resolution mapping or
regular plain farmlands while lacking representation of complex terraced
terrains due to the demands of precision agriculture.In this paper, we
introduce a more fine-grained terraced parcel dataset named GTPBD (Global
Terraced Parcel and Boundary Dataset), which is the first fine-grained dataset
covering major worldwide terraced regions with more than 200,000 complex
terraced parcels with manual annotation. GTPBD comprises 47,537 high-resolution
images with three-level labels, including pixel-level boundary labels, mask
labels, and parcel labels. It covers seven major geographic zones in China and
transcontinental climatic regions around the world.Compared to the existing
datasets, the GTPBD dataset brings considerable challenges due to the: (1)
terrain diversity; (2) complex and irregular parcel objects; and (3) multiple
domain styles. Our proposed GTPBD dataset is suitable for four different tasks,
including semantic segmentation, edge detection, terraced parcel extraction,
and unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) tasks.Accordingly, we benchmark the
GTPBD dataset on eight semantic segmentation methods, four edge extraction
methods, three parcel extraction methods, and five UDA methods, along with a
multi-dimensional evaluation framework integrating pixel-level and object-level
metrics. GTPBD fills a critical gap in terraced remote sensing research,
providing a basic infrastructure for fine-grained agricultural terrain analysis
and cross-scenario knowledge transfer.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of preventable blindness,
affecting over 100 million people worldwide. In the United States, individuals
from lower-income communities face a higher risk of progressing to advanced
stages before diagnosis, largely due to limited access to screening. Comorbid
conditions further accelerate disease progression. We propose MultiRetNet, a
novel pipeline combining retinal imaging, socioeconomic factors, and
comorbidity profiles to improve DR staging accuracy, integrated with a clinical
deferral system for a clinical human-in-the-loop implementation. We experiment
with three multimodal fusion methods and identify fusion through a fully
connected layer as the most versatile methodology. We synthesize adversarial,
low-quality images and use contrastive learning to train the deferral system,
guiding the model to identify out-of-distribution samples that warrant
clinician review. By maintaining diagnostic accuracy on suboptimal images and
integrating critical health data, our system can improve early detection,
particularly in underserved populations where advanced DR is often first
identified. This approach may reduce healthcare costs, increase early detection
rates, and address disparities in access to care, promoting healthcare equity.

Abstract: Traffic monitoring is crucial for urban mobility, road safety, and
intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Deep learning has advanced
video-based traffic monitoring through video question answering (VideoQA)
models, enabling structured insight extraction from traffic videos. However,
existing VideoQA models struggle with the complexity of real-world traffic
scenes, where multiple concurrent events unfold across spatiotemporal
dimensions. To address these challenges, this paper introduces \textbf{InterAct
VideoQA}, a curated dataset designed to benchmark and enhance VideoQA models
for traffic monitoring tasks. The InterAct VideoQA dataset comprises 8 hours of
real-world traffic footage collected from diverse intersections, segmented into
10-second video clips, with over 25,000 question-answer (QA) pairs covering
spatiotemporal dynamics, vehicle interactions, incident detection, and other
critical traffic attributes. State-of-the-art VideoQA models are evaluated on
InterAct VideoQA, exposing challenges in reasoning over fine-grained
spatiotemporal dependencies within complex traffic scenarios. Additionally,
fine-tuning these models on InterAct VideoQA yields notable performance
improvements, demonstrating the necessity of domain-specific datasets for
VideoQA. InterAct VideoQA is publicly available as a benchmark dataset to

Abstract: Video Question Answering (VideoQA) requires identifying sparse critical
moments in long videos and reasoning about their causal relationships to answer
semantically complex questions. While recent advances in multimodal learning
have improved alignment and fusion, current approaches remain limited by two
prevalent but fundamentally flawed strategies: (1) task-agnostic sampling
indiscriminately processes all frames, overwhelming key events with irrelevant
content; and (2) heuristic retrieval captures superficial patterns but misses
causal-temporal structures needed for complex reasoning. To address these
challenges, we introduce LeAdQA, an innovative approach that bridges these gaps
through synergizing causal-aware query refinement with fine-grained visual
grounding. Our method first leverages LLMs to reformulate question-option
pairs, resolving causal ambiguities and sharpening temporal focus. These
refined queries subsequently direct a temporal grounding model to precisely
retrieve the most salient segments, complemented by an adaptive fusion
mechanism dynamically integrating the evidence to maximize relevance. The
integrated visual-textual cues are then processed by an MLLM to generate
accurate, contextually-grounded answers. Experiments on NExT-QA, IntentQA, and
NExT-GQA demonstrate that our method's precise visual grounding substantially
enhances the understanding of video-question relationships, achieving
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on complex reasoning tasks while
maintaining computational efficiency.

TL;DR: FOCUS框架通过类特定光谱提示和可学习的[SINK]标记，实现了高效且可靠的ViT空间-光谱解释性，解决了HSI数据的高维性和注意力崩溃问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于现有显著性方法难以捕捉有意义的光谱线索且全光谱ViT计算成本高，HSI中ViT的解释性研究不足。

Method: FOCUS引入类特定光谱提示和[SINK]标记，通过单次前向传递生成3D显著性图和光谱重要性曲线。

Result: FOCUS提高了波段级IoU 15%，减少注意力崩溃40%以上，且结果与专家标注高度一致。

Conclusion: FOCUS以不到1%的参数开销，为高分辨率ViT解释性提供了实用解决方案，填补了黑盒建模与可信HSI决策之间的空白。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) captures hundreds of narrow, contiguous
wavelength bands, making it a powerful tool in biology, agriculture, and
environmental monitoring. However, interpreting Vision Transformers (ViTs) in
this setting remains largely unexplored due to two key challenges: (1) existing
saliency methods struggle to capture meaningful spectral cues, often collapsing
attention onto the class token, and (2) full-spectrum ViTs are computationally
prohibitive for interpretability, given the high-dimensional nature of HSI
data. We present FOCUS, the first framework that enables reliable and efficient
spatial-spectral interpretability for frozen ViTs. FOCUS introduces two core
components: class-specific spectral prompts that guide attention toward
semantically meaningful wavelength groups, and a learnable [SINK] token trained
with an attraction loss to absorb noisy or redundant attention. Together, these
designs make it possible to generate stable and interpretable 3D saliency maps
and spectral importance curves in a single forward pass, without any gradient
backpropagation or backbone modification. FOCUS improves band-level IoU by 15
percent, reduces attention collapse by over 40 percent, and produces saliency
results that align closely with expert annotations. With less than 1 percent
parameter overhead, our method makes high-resolution ViT interpretability
practical for real-world hyperspectral applications, bridging a long-standing
gap between black-box modeling and trustworthy HSI decision-making.

### [46] [A Novel Downsampling Strategy Based on Information Complementarity for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14790)
*Wenbo Yue,Chang Li,Guoping Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于信息互补的下采样方法HPD，通过MinMaxPooling保留图像细节，提升语义分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统下采样方法可能导致关键空间信息丢失，影响像素级预测精度。

Method: 使用MinMaxPooling替代传统方法，保留图像明暗对比和细节特征。

Result: 在ACDC和Synapse数据集上，HPD平均提升DSC系数0.5%。

Conclusion: HPD为语义分割任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: In convolutional neural networks (CNNs), downsampling operations are crucial
to model performance. Although traditional downsampling methods (such as
maximum pooling and cross-row convolution) perform well in feature aggregation,
receptive field expansion, and computational reduction, they may lead to the
loss of key spatial information in semantic segmentation tasks, thereby
affecting the pixel-by-pixel prediction accuracy.To this end, this study
proposes a downsampling method based on information complementarity - Hybrid
Pooling Downsampling (HPD). The core is to replace the traditional method with
MinMaxPooling, and effectively retain the light and dark contrast and detail
features of the image by extracting the maximum value information of the local
area.Experiment on various CNN architectures on the ACDC and Synapse datasets
show that HPD outperforms traditional methods in segmentation performance, and
increases the DSC coefficient by 0.5% on average. The results show that the HPD
module provides an efficient solution for semantic segmentation tasks.

*Beier Zhu,Ruoyu Wang,Tong Zhao,Hanwang Zhang,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为EPD的新型ODE求解器，通过并行梯度评估减少截断误差，实现高质量低延迟采样。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型（DMs）生成性能优越，但因其顺序去噪特性导致采样延迟高，现有加速方法在低延迟下图像质量下降。

Method: EPD通过在每个ODE步骤中引入多个并行梯度评估来减少截断误差，且梯度计算可完全并行化。通过蒸馏方式优化少量可学习参数，训练开销小。

Result: 在多个图像合成基准测试中，EPD在5 NFE延迟水平下表现优异，FID显著优于现有基于学习的求解器。

Conclusion: EPD是一种高效且通用的ODE求解器插件，能显著提升采样质量和速度。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have achieved state-of-the-art generative performance
but suffer from high sampling latency due to their sequential denoising nature.
Existing solver-based acceleration methods often face image quality degradation
under a low-latency budget. In this paper, we propose the Ensemble Parallel
Direction solver (dubbed as \ours), a novel ODE solver that mitigates
truncation errors by incorporating multiple parallel gradient evaluations in
each ODE step. Importantly, since the additional gradient computations are
independent, they can be fully parallelized, preserving low-latency sampling.
  Our method optimizes a small set of learnable parameters in a distillation
fashion, ensuring minimal training overhead.
  In addition, our method can serve as a plugin to improve existing ODE
samplers. Extensive experiments on various image synthesis benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of our \ours~in achieving high-quality and
low-latency sampling. For example, at the same latency level of 5 NFE, EPD
achieves an FID of 4.47 on CIFAR-10, 7.97 on FFHQ, 8.17 on ImageNet, and 8.26
on LSUN Bedroom, surpassing existing learning-based solvers by a significant
margin. Codes are available in https://github.com/BeierZhu/EPD.

Motivation: 探索这些模型在航拍图像块上的潜力，填补其在摄影测量领域未被充分研究的空白。

Method: 在UseGeo数据集的航拍图像块上对预训练的DUSt3R、MASt3R和VGGT模型进行全面评估，测试姿态估计和密集3D重建能力。

Result: 模型能从极稀疏图像集（少于10张）中重建密集点云，完整性比COLMAP提升50%，VGGT计算效率更高。但高分辨率和大图像集下姿态估计可靠性下降。

Conclusion: 基于Transformer的方法无法完全替代传统SfM和MVS，但在低分辨率、稀疏场景中可作为补充方法。

Abstract: State-of-the-art 3D computer vision algorithms continue to advance in
handling sparse, unordered image sets. Recently developed foundational models
for 3D reconstruction, such as Dense and Unconstrained Stereo 3D Reconstruction
(DUSt3R), Matching and Stereo 3D Reconstruction (MASt3R), and Visual Geometry
Grounded Transformer (VGGT), have attracted attention due to their ability to
handle very sparse image overlaps. Evaluating DUSt3R/MASt3R/VGGT on typical
aerial images matters, as these models may handle extremely low image overlaps,
stereo occlusions, and textureless regions. For redundant collections, they can
accelerate 3D reconstruction by using extremely sparsified image sets. Despite
tests on various computer vision benchmarks, their potential on photogrammetric
aerial blocks remains unexplored. This paper conducts a comprehensive
evaluation of the pre-trained DUSt3R/MASt3R/VGGT models on the aerial blocks of
the UseGeo dataset for pose estimation and dense 3D reconstruction. Results
show these methods can accurately reconstruct dense point clouds from very
sparse image sets (fewer than 10 images, up to 518 pixels resolution), with
completeness gains up to +50% over COLMAP. VGGT also demonstrates higher
computational efficiency, scalability, and more reliable camera pose
estimation. However, all exhibit limitations with high-resolution images and
large sets, as pose reliability declines with more images and geometric
complexity. These findings suggest transformer-based methods cannot fully
replace traditional SfM and MVS, but offer promise as complementary approaches,
especially in challenging, low-resolution, and sparse scenarios.

Conclusion: VPIP框架具有高效性、扩展性和潜力，可作为低层视觉任务的统一基础。

Abstract: Low-level vision involves a wide spectrum of tasks, including image
restoration, enhancement, stylization, and feature extraction, which differ
significantly in both task formulation and output domains. To address the
challenge of unified modeling across such diverse tasks, we propose a Visual
task Prompt-based Image Processing (VPIP) framework that leverages input-target
image pairs as visual prompts to guide the model in performing a variety of
low-level vision tasks. The framework comprises an end-to-end image processing
backbone, a prompt encoder, and a prompt interaction module, enabling flexible
integration with various architectures and effective utilization of
task-specific visual representations. Based on this design, we develop a
unified low-level vision model, GenLV, and evaluate its performance across
multiple representative tasks. To explore the scalability of this approach, we
extend the framework along two dimensions: model capacity and task diversity.
We construct a large-scale benchmark consisting of over 100 low-level vision
tasks and train multiple versions of the model with varying scales.
Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves considerable
performance across a wide range of tasks. Notably, increasing the number of
training tasks enhances generalization, particularly for tasks with limited
data, indicating the model's ability to learn transferable representations
through joint training. Further evaluations in zero-shot generalization,
few-shot transfer, and task-specific fine-tuning scenarios demonstrate the
model's strong adaptability, confirming the effectiveness, scalability, and
potential of the proposed framework as a unified foundation for general
low-level vision modeling.

Motivation: 现有方法在单脸检测中表现良好，但在多脸场景中因缺乏上下文线索而效果不佳。

Method: 通过人类研究识别四种关键线索，并基于此设计HICOM框架，结合LLM提供可解释性。

Result: HICOM在基准数据集上平均准确率提升3.3%，在未见数据集上优于现有方法5.8%。

Conclusion: 结合人类认知线索可有效提升深度伪造检测能力，并增强结果的可解释性。

Abstract: Multi-face deepfake videos are becoming increasingly prevalent, often
appearing in natural social settings that challenge existing detection methods.
Most current approaches excel at single-face detection but struggle in
multi-face scenarios, due to a lack of awareness of crucial contextual cues. In
this work, we develop a novel approach that leverages human cognition to
analyze and defend against multi-face deepfake videos. Through a series of
human studies, we systematically examine how people detect deepfake faces in
social settings. Our quantitative analysis reveals four key cues humans rely
on: scene-motion coherence, inter-face appearance compatibility, interpersonal
gaze alignment, and face-body consistency. Guided by these insights, we
introduce \textsf{HICOM}, a novel framework designed to detect every fake face
in multi-face scenarios. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that
\textsf{HICOM} improves average accuracy by 3.3\% in in-dataset detection and
2.8\% under real-world perturbations. Moreover, it outperforms existing methods
by 5.8\% on unseen datasets, demonstrating the generalization of human-inspired
cues. \textsf{HICOM} further enhances interpretability by incorporating an LLM
to provide human-readable explanations, making detection results more
transparent and convincing. Our work sheds light on involving human factors to
enhance defense against deepfakes.

Motivation: 预测未来运动轨迹在机器人、自动驾驶等领域至关重要，现有视频预测模型计算成本高且延迟大，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 采用InstructPix2Pix模型，将其扩展为多模态输入（图像和文本），用于预测未来100帧的视觉内容。

Result: 在RoboTWin数据集上，该方法在SSIM和PSNR指标上优于现有基线模型，且计算效率更高。

Conclusion: 该方法为机器人动作预测提供了一种高效、轻量级的解决方案，特别适用于对计算资源敏感的应用场景。

Abstract: Predicting future motion trajectories is a critical capability across domains
such as robotics, autonomous systems, and human activity forecasting, enabling
safer and more intelligent decision-making. This paper proposes a novel,
efficient, and lightweight approach for robot action prediction, offering
significantly reduced computational cost and inference latency compared to
conventional video prediction models. Importantly, it pioneers the adaptation
of the InstructPix2Pix model for forecasting future visual frames in robotic
tasks, extending its utility beyond static image editing. We implement a deep
learning-based visual prediction framework that forecasts what a robot will
observe 100 frames (10 seconds) into the future, given a current image and a
textual instruction. We repurpose and fine-tune the InstructPix2Pix model to
accept both visual and textual inputs, enabling multimodal future frame
prediction. Experiments on the RoboTWin dataset (generated based on real-world
scenarios) demonstrate that our method achieves superior SSIM and PSNR compared
to state-of-the-art baselines in robot action prediction tasks. Unlike
conventional video prediction models that require multiple input frames, heavy
computation, and slow inference latency, our approach only needs a single image
and a text prompt as input. This lightweight design enables faster inference,
reduced GPU demands, and flexible multimodal control, particularly valuable for
applications like robotics and sports motion trajectory analytics, where motion
trajectory precision is prioritized over visual fidelity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在生成能力上表现出色，但计算成本高，难以在资源受限或延迟敏感的环境中部署。现有后训练量化方法依赖特定架构启发式，通用性差。

Method: 提出SegQuant框架，包含SegLinear（分段感知的图量化策略）和DualScale（双尺度量化方案），以捕捉结构语义和空间异质性，并保留极性不对称激活。

Result: SegQuant在Transformer以外的扩散模型中表现优异，保持生成输出的视觉保真度，并与主流部署工具兼容。

Conclusion: SegQuant为扩散模型提供了一种高效、通用的量化解决方案，适用于工业部署。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional generative capabilities but
are computationally intensive, posing significant challenges for deployment in
resource-constrained or latency-sensitive environments. Quantization offers an
effective means to reduce model size and computational cost, with post-training
quantization (PTQ) being particularly appealing due to its compatibility with
pre-trained models without requiring retraining or training data. However,
existing PTQ methods for diffusion models often rely on architecture-specific
heuristics that limit their generalizability and hinder integration with
industrial deployment pipelines. To address these limitations, we propose
SegQuant, a unified quantization framework that adaptively combines
complementary techniques to enhance cross-model versatility. SegQuant consists
of a segment-aware, graph-based quantization strategy (SegLinear) that captures
structural semantics and spatial heterogeneity, along with a dual-scale
quantization scheme (DualScale) that preserves polarity-asymmetric activations,
which is crucial for maintaining visual fidelity in generated outputs. SegQuant
is broadly applicable beyond Transformer-based diffusion models, achieving
strong performance while ensuring seamless compatibility with mainstream
deployment tools.

introduce FinChart-Bench, the first benchmark specifically focused on
real-world financial charts. FinChart-Bench comprises 1,200 financial chart
images collected from 2015 to 2024, each annotated with True/False (TF),
Multiple Choice (MC), and Question Answering (QA) questions, totaling 7,016
questions. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 25 state-of-the-art LVLMs
on FinChart-Bench. Our evaluation reveals critical insights: (1) the
performance gap between open-source and closed-source models is narrowing, (2)
performance degradation occurs in upgraded models within families, (3) many
models struggle with instruction following, (4) both advanced models show
significant limitations in spatial reasoning abilities, and (5) current LVLMs
are not reliable enough to serve as automated evaluators. These findings

Abstract: Image dehazing aims to remove unwanted hazy artifacts in images. Although
previous research has collected paired real-world hazy and haze-free images to
improve dehazing models' performance in real-world scenarios, these models
often experience significant performance drops when handling unseen real-world
hazy images due to limited training data. This issue motivates us to develop a
flexible domain adaptation method to enhance dehazing performance during
testing. Observing that predicting haze patterns is generally easier than
recovering clean content, we propose the Physics-guided Haze Transfer Network
(PHATNet) which transfers haze patterns from unseen target domains to
source-domain haze-free images, creating domain-specific fine-tuning sets to
update dehazing models for effective domain adaptation. Additionally, we
introduce a Haze-Transfer-Consistency loss and a Content-Leakage Loss to
enhance PHATNet's disentanglement ability. Experimental results demonstrate
that PHATNet significantly boosts state-of-the-art dehazing models on benchmark
real-world image dehazing datasets.

Abstract: The segmentation of mass lesions in digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) images
is very significant for the early screening of breast cancer. However, the
high-density breast tissue often leads to high concealment of the mass lesions,
which makes manual annotation difficult and time-consuming. As a result, there
is a lack of annotated data for model training. Diffusion models are commonly
used for data augmentation, but the existing methods face two challenges.
First, due to the high concealment of lesions, it is difficult for the model to
learn the features of the lesion area. This leads to the low generation quality
of the lesion areas, thus limiting the quality of the generated images. Second,
existing methods can only generate images and cannot generate corresponding
annotations, which restricts the usability of the generated images in
supervised training. In this work, we propose a paired image generation method.
The method does not require external conditions and can achieve the generation
of paired images by training an extra diffusion guider for the conditional
diffusion model. During the experimental phase, we generated paired DBT slices
and mass lesion masks. Then, we incorporated them into the supervised training
process of the mass lesion segmentation task. The experimental results show
that our method can improve the generation quality without external conditions.
Moreover, it contributes to alleviating the shortage of annotated data, thus
enhancing the performance of downstream tasks.

Conclusion: 新方法在无需密集标签或多帧数据的情况下，实现了高质量的深度补全。

Abstract: Depth completion is an important vision task, and many efforts have been made
to enhance the quality of depth maps from sparse depth measurements. Despite
significant advances, training these models to recover dense depth from sparse
measurements remains a challenging problem. Supervised learning methods rely on
dense depth labels to predict unobserved regions, while self-supervised
approaches require image sequences to enforce geometric constraints and
photometric consistency between frames. However, acquiring dense annotations is
costly, and multi-frame dependencies limit the applicability of self-supervised
methods in static or single-frame scenarios. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel self-supervised depth completion paradigm that requires only
sparse depth measurements and their corresponding image for training. Unlike
existing methods, our approach eliminates the need for dense depth labels or
additional images captured from neighboring viewpoints. By leveraging the
characteristics of depth distribution, we design novel loss functions that
effectively propagate depth information from observed points to unobserved
regions. Additionally, we incorporate segmentation maps generated by vision
foundation models to further enhance depth estimation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Abstract: In this work, we propose an all-in-one video restoration framework that
grounds degradation-aware semantic context of video frames in natural language
via foundation models, offering interpretable and flexible guidance. Unlike
prior art, our method assumes no degradation knowledge in train or test time
and learns an approximation to the grounded knowledge such that the foundation
model can be safely disentangled during inference adding no extra cost.
Further, we call for standardization of benchmarks in all-in-one video
restoration, and propose two benchmarks in multi-degradation setting,
three-task (3D) and four-task (4D), and two time-varying composite degradation
benchmarks; one of the latter being our proposed dataset with varying snow
intensity, simulating how weather degradations affect videos naturally. We
compare our method with prior works and report state-of-the-art performance on
all benchmarks.

Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of object detection with a focus on
improving both the localization accuracy of bounding boxes and explicitly
modeling prediction uncertainty. Conventional detectors rely on deterministic
bounding box regression, ignoring uncertainty in predictions and limiting model
robustness. In this paper, we propose an uncertainty-aware enhancement
framework for DETR-based object detectors. We model bounding boxes as
multivariate Gaussian distributions and incorporate the Gromov-Wasserstein
distance into the loss function to better align the predicted and ground-truth
distributions. Building on this, we derive a Bayes Risk formulation to filter
high-risk information and improve detection reliability. We also propose a
simple algorithm to quantify localization uncertainty via confidence intervals.
Experiments on the COCO benchmark show that our method can be effectively
integrated into existing DETR variants, enhancing their performance. We further
extend our framework to leukocyte detection tasks, achieving state-of-the-art
results on the LISC and WBCDD datasets. These results confirm the scalability
of our framework across both general and domain-specific detection tasks. Code

Abstract: Micro-gestures are unconsciously performed body gestures that can convey the
emotion states of humans and start to attract more research attention in the
fields of human behavior understanding and affective computing as an emerging
topic. However, the modeling of human emotion based on micro-gestures has not
been explored sufficiently. In this work, we propose to recognize the emotion
states based on the micro-gestures by reconstructing the behavior patterns with
a hypergraph-enhanced Transformer in a hybrid-supervised framework. In the
framework, hypergraph Transformer based encoder and decoder are separately
designed by stacking the hypergraph-enhanced self-attention and multiscale
temporal convolution modules. Especially, to better capture the subtle motion
of micro-gestures, we construct a decoder with additional upsampling operations
for a reconstruction task in a self-supervised learning manner. We further
propose a hypergraph-enhanced self-attention module where the hyperedges
between skeleton joints are gradually updated to present the relationships of
body joints for modeling the subtle local motion. Lastly, for exploiting the
relationship between the emotion states and local motion of micro-gestures, an
emotion recognition head from the output of encoder is designed with a shallow
architecture and learned in a supervised way. The end-to-end framework is
jointly trained in a one-stage way by comprehensively utilizing
self-reconstruction and supervision information. The proposed method is
evaluated on two publicly available datasets, namely iMiGUE and SMG, and
achieves the best performance under multiple metrics, which is superior to the
existing methods.

Abstract: In recent years, the emergence of foundation models for depth prediction has
led to remarkable progress, particularly in zero-shot monocular depth
estimation. These models generate impressive depth predictions; however, their
outputs are often in relative scale rather than metric scale. This limitation
poses challenges for direct deployment in real-world applications. To address
this, several scale adaptation methods have been proposed to enable foundation
models to produce metric depth. However, these methods are typically costly, as
they require additional training on new domains and datasets. Moreover,
fine-tuning these models often compromises their original generalization
capabilities, limiting their adaptability across diverse scenes. In this paper,
we introduce a non-learning-based approach that leverages sparse depth
measurements to adapt the relative-scale predictions of foundation models into
metric-scale depth. Our method requires neither retraining nor fine-tuning,
thereby preserving the strong generalization ability of the original foundation
models while enabling them to produce metric depth. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, high-lighting its potential to
bridge the gap between relative and metric depth without incurring additional
computational costs or sacrificing generalization ability.

Conclusion: BeatFormer通过结合手工方法和深度学习的优势，实现了高效且鲁棒的rPPG估计，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) captures cardiac signals from facial
videos and is gaining attention for its diverse applications. While deep
learning has advanced rPPG estimation, it relies on large, diverse datasets for
effective generalization. In contrast, handcrafted methods utilize
physiological priors for better generalization in unseen scenarios like motion
while maintaining computational efficiency. However, their linear assumptions
limit performance in complex conditions, where deep learning provides superior
pulsatile information extraction. This highlights the need for hybrid
approaches that combine the strengths of both methods. To address this, we
present BeatFormer, a lightweight spectral attention model for rPPG estimation,
which integrates zoomed orthonormal complex attention and frequency-domain
energy measurement, enabling a highly efficient model. Additionally, we
introduce Spectral Contrastive Learning (SCL), which allows BeatFormer to be
trained without any PPG or HR labels. We validate BeatFormer on the PURE,
UBFC-rPPG, and MMPD datasets, demonstrating its robustness and performance,
particularly in cross-dataset evaluations under motion scenarios.

Abstract: 3D visual grounding allows an embodied agent to understand visual information
in real-world 3D environments based on human instructions, which is crucial for
embodied intelligence. Existing 3D visual grounding methods typically rely on
separate encoders for different modalities (e.g., RGB images, text, and 3D
point clouds), resulting in large and complex models that are inefficient to
train. While some approaches use pre-trained 2D multi-modal models like CLIP
for 3D tasks, they still struggle with aligning point cloud data to 2D
encoders. As a result, these methods continue to depend on 3D encoders for
feature extraction, further increasing model complexity and training
inefficiency. In this paper, we propose a unified 2D pre-trained multi-modal
network to process all three modalities (RGB images, text, and point clouds),
significantly simplifying the architecture. By leveraging a 2D CLIP bi-modal
model with adapter-based fine-tuning, this framework effectively adapts to the
tri-modal setting, improving both adaptability and performance across
modalities. Our Geometric-Aware 2D-3D Feature Recovery and Fusion (GARF) module
is designed to fuse geometric multi-scale features from point clouds and
images. We then integrate textual features for final modality fusion and
introduce a multi-modal decoder to facilitate deep cross-modal understanding.
Together, our method achieves unified feature extraction and fusion across the
three modalities, enabling an end-to-end 3D visual grounding model. Compared to
the baseline, our method reduces the number of trainable parameters by
approximately 58\%, while achieving a 6.52\% improvement in the 3D detection
task and a 6.25\% improvement in the 3D visual grounding task.

Conclusion: SARL通过语义对齐和区域聚合显著提升了多标签分类效果。

Abstract: Multi-label image classification, an important research area in computer
vision, focuses on identifying multiple labels or concepts within an image.
Existing approaches often employ attention mechanisms or graph convolutional
networks (GCNs) to learn image representation. However, this representation may
contain noise and may not locate objects precisely. Therefore, this paper
proposes a Semantic-Aware Representation Learning (SARL) for multi-label image
classification. First, a label semantic-related feature learning module is
utilized to extract semantic-related features. Then, an optimal transport-based
attention mechanism is designed to obtain semantically aligned image
representation. Finally, a regional score aggregation strategy is used for
multi-label prediction. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets, PASCAL
VOC 2007 and MS-COCO, demonstrate the superiority of SARL over existing
methods.

Conclusion: \method为现实世界3D内容生成提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction showcases advanced
Image-to-3D content creation but requires substantial computational resources
and large datasets, posing challenges to training models from scratch. Current
methods usually entangle the prediction of 3D Gaussian geometry and appearance,
which rely heavily on data-driven priors and result in slow regression speeds.
To address this, we propose \method, a disentangled framework for efficient 3D
Gaussian prediction. Our method extracts features from local image pairs using
a stereo vision backbone and fuses them via global attention blocks. Dedicated
point and Gaussian prediction heads generate multi-view point-maps for geometry
and Gaussian features for appearance, combined as GS-maps to represent the 3DGS
object. A refinement network enhances these GS-maps for high-quality
reconstruction. Unlike existing methods that depend on camera parameters, our
approach achieves pose-free 3D reconstruction, improving robustness and
practicality. By reducing resource demands while maintaining high-quality
outputs, \method provides an efficient, scalable solution for real-world 3D
content generation.

Motivation: 冷冻电镜中低信噪比（SNR）导致姿态估计和位移校正困难，直接影响3D重建的准确性。现有方法对噪声敏感且约束条件处理不完善。

Conclusion: 该方法通过鲁棒优化和严格约束，显著提升了低信噪比条件下的冷冻电镜重建质量。

Abstract: Accurate pose estimation and shift correction are key challenges in cryo-EM
due to the very low SNR, which directly impacts the fidelity of 3D
reconstructions. We present an approach for pose estimation in cryo-EM that
leverages multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) techniques in a robust manner to
estimate the 3D rotation matrix of each particle from pairs of dihedral angles.
We express the rotation matrix in the form of an axis of rotation and a unit
vector in the plane perpendicular to the axis. The technique leverages the
concept of common lines in 3D reconstruction from projections. However, common
line estimation is ridden with large errors due to the very low SNR of cryo-EM
projection images. To address this challenge, we introduce two complementary
components: (i) a robust joint optimization framework for pose estimation based
on an $\ell_1$-norm objective or a similar robust norm, which simultaneously
estimates rotation axes and in-plane vectors while exactly enforcing unit norm
and orthogonality constraints via projected coordinate descent; and (ii) an
iterative shift correction algorithm that estimates consistent in-plane
translations through a global least-squares formulation. While prior approaches
have leveraged such embeddings and common-line geometry for orientation
recovery, existing formulations typically rely on $\ell_2$-based objectives
that are sensitive to noise, and enforce geometric constraints only
approximately. These choices, combined with a sequential pipeline structure,
can lead to compounding errors and suboptimal reconstructions in low-SNR
regimes. Our pipeline consistently outperforms prior methods in both Euler
angle accuracy and reconstruction fidelity, as measured by the Fourier Shell
Correlation (FSC).

Abstract: The Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) paradigm is attracting plenty of
attention in medical imaging classification, where labeled data is scarce. MIL
methods cast medical images as bags of instances (e.g. patches in whole slide
images, or slices in CT scans), and only bag labels are required for training.
Deep MIL approaches have obtained promising results by aggregating
instance-level representations via an attention mechanism to compute the
bag-level prediction. These methods typically capture both local interactions
among adjacent instances and global, long-range dependencies through various
mechanisms. However, they treat attention values deterministically, potentially
overlooking uncertainty in the contribution of individual instances. In this
work we propose a novel probabilistic framework that estimates a probability
distribution over the attention values, and accounts for both global and local
interactions. In a comprehensive evaluation involving {\color{review} eleven}
state-of-the-art baselines and three medical datasets, we show that our
approach achieves top predictive performance in different metrics. Moreover,
the probabilistic treatment of the attention provides uncertainty maps that are
interpretable in terms of illness localization.

Abstract: This paper extends Cross Modal Generalization (CMG) to open-set environments
by proposing the more challenging Open-set Cross Modal Generalization (OSCMG)
task. This task evaluates multimodal unified representations in open-set
conditions, addressing the limitations of prior closed-set cross-modal
evaluations. OSCMG requires not only cross-modal knowledge transfer but also
robust generalization to unseen classes within new modalities, a scenario
frequently encountered in real-world applications. Existing multimodal unified
representation work lacks consideration for open-set environments. To tackle
this, we propose MICU, comprising two key components: Fine-Coarse Masked
multimodal InfoNCE (FCMI) and Cross modal Unified Jigsaw Puzzles (CUJP). FCMI
enhances multimodal alignment by applying contrastive learning at both holistic
semantic and temporal levels, incorporating masking to enhance generalization.
CUJP enhances feature diversity and model uncertainty by integrating
modality-agnostic feature selection with self-supervised learning, thereby
strengthening the model's ability to handle unknown categories in open-set
tasks. Extensive experiments on CMG and the newly proposed OSCMG validate the
effectiveness of our approach. The code is available at

Conclusion: Polymorph通过模块化策略显著提升嵌入式设备上视频分类的效率和性能，且已开源。

Abstract: Real-time multi-label video classification on embedded devices is constrained
by limited compute and energy budgets. Yet, video streams exhibit structural
properties such as label sparsity, temporal continuity, and label co-occurrence
that can be leveraged for more efficient inference. We introduce Polymorph, a
context-aware framework that activates a minimal set of lightweight Low Rank
Adapters (LoRA) per frame. Each adapter specializes in a subset of classes
derived from co-occurrence patterns and is implemented as a LoRA weight over a
shared backbone. At runtime, Polymorph dynamically selects and composes only
the adapters needed to cover the active labels, avoiding full-model switching
and weight merging. This modular strategy improves scalability while reducing
latency and energy overhead. Polymorph achieves 40% lower energy consumption
and improves mAP by 9 points over strong baselines on the TAO dataset.

Abstract: Low-overlap point cloud registration (PCR) remains a significant challenge in
3D vision. Traditional evaluation metrics, such as Maximum Inlier Count, become
ineffective under extremely low inlier ratios. In this paper, we revisit the
registration result evaluation problem and identify the Decision version of the
PCR task as the fundamental problem. To address this Decision PCR task, we
propose a data-driven approach. First, we construct a corresponding dataset
based on the 3DMatch dataset. Then, a deep learning-based classifier is trained
to reliably assess registration quality, overcoming the limitations of
traditional metrics. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study to
address this task through a deep learning framework. We incorporate this
classifier into standard PCR pipelines. When integrated with our approach,
existing state-of-the-art PCR methods exhibit significantly enhanced
registration performance. For example, combining our framework with
GeoTransformer achieves a new SOTA registration recall of 86.97\% on the
challenging 3DLoMatch benchmark. Our method also demonstrates strong
generalization capabilities on the unseen outdoor ETH dataset.

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP have shown excellent
generalization abilities. However, adapting these large-scale models to
downstream tasks while preserving their generalization capabilities remains
challenging. Although prompt learning methods have shown promise, they suffer
from two fundamental bottlenecks that limit generalization: (a) modality
isolation, and (b) hierarchical semantic decay. To address these limitations,
we propose HiCroPL, a Hierarchical Cross-modal Prompt Learning framework that
establishes bidirectional knowledge flow between text and vision modalities,
enabling them to refine their semantics mutually. HiCroPL routes knowledge
flows by leveraging the complementary strengths of text and vision. In early
layers, text prompts inject relatively clear semantics into visual prompts
through a hierarchical knowledge mapper, enhancing the representation of
low-level visual semantics. In later layers, visual prompts encoding specific
task-relevant objects flow back to refine text prompts, enabling deeper
alignment. Crucially, our hierarchical knowledge mapper allows representations
at multi-scales to be fused, ensuring that deeper representations retain
transferable shallow semantics thereby enhancing generalization. We further
introduce a lightweight layer-specific knowledge proxy to enable efficient
cross-modal interactions. Extensive evaluations across four tasks demonstrate
HiCroPL's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results on 11
benchmarks with significant improvements. Code is available at:

Conclusion: 语义提示对MLLMs性能至关重要，强调了在多模态回归任务中融入有意义文本上下文的重要性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show promise for image-based
regression tasks, but current approaches face key limitations. Recent methods
fine-tune MLLMs using preset output vocabularies and generic task-level prompts
(e.g., "How would you rate this image?"), assuming this mimics human rating
behavior. Our analysis reveals these approaches provide no benefit over
image-only training. Models using preset vocabularies and generic prompts
perform equivalently to image-only models, failing to leverage semantic
understanding from textual input. We propose Regression via Transformer-Based
Classification (RvTC), which replaces vocabulary-constrained classification
with a flexible bin-based approach. Unlike approaches that address
discretization errors through complex distributional modeling, RvTC eliminates
manual vocabulary crafting through straightforward bin increase, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on four image assessment datasets using only
images. More importantly, we demonstrate that data-specific prompts
dramatically improve performance. Unlike generic task descriptions, prompts
containing semantic information about specific images enable MLLMs to leverage
cross-modal understanding. On the AVA dataset, adding challenge titles to
prompts improves correlations from 0.83 to 0.90, a new state-of-the-art. We
demonstrate through empirical evidence from the AVA and AGIQA-3k datasets that
MLLMs benefit from semantic prompt information surpassing mere statistical
biases. This underscores the importance of incorporating meaningful textual
context in multimodal regression tasks.

Conclusion: 轴对齐几何约束和预处理策略有效提升了文档去扭曲的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Document dewarping is crucial for many applications. However, existing
learning-based methods primarily rely on supervised regression with annotated
data without leveraging the inherent geometric properties in physical documents
to the dewarping process. Our key insight is that a well-dewarped document is
characterized by transforming distorted feature lines into axis-aligned ones.
This property aligns with the inherent axis-aligned nature of the discrete grid
geometry in planar documents. In the training phase, we propose an axis-aligned
geometric constraint to enhance document dewarping. In the inference phase, we
propose an axis alignment preprocessing strategy to reduce the dewarping
difficulty. In the evaluation phase, we introduce a new metric, Axis-Aligned
Distortion (AAD), that not only incorporates geometric meaning and aligns with
human visual perception but also demonstrates greater robustness. As a result,
our method achieves SOTA results on multiple existing benchmarks and achieves
18.2%~34.5% improvements on the AAD metric.

Abstract: Accurately identifying and representing object edges is a challenging task in
computer vision and image processing. The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has
significantly influenced the field of image segmentation, but suffers from high
memory consumption and long inference times, limiting its efficiency in
real-time applications. To address these limitations, Fast Segment Anything
(FastSAM) was proposed, achieving real-time segmentation. However, FastSAM
often generates jagged edges that deviate from the true object shapes.
Therefore, this paper introduces a novel refinement approach using B-Spline
curve fitting techniques to enhance the edge quality in FastSAM. Leveraging the
robust shape control and flexible geometric construction of B-Splines, a
four-stage refining process involving two rounds of curve fitting is employed
to effectively smooth jagged edges. This approach significantly improves the
visual quality and analytical accuracy of object edges without compromising
critical geometric information. The proposed method improves the practical
utility of FastSAM by improving segmentation accuracy while maintaining
real-time processing capabilities. This advancement unlocks greater potential
for FastSAM technology in various real-world scenarios, such as industrial
automation, medical imaging, and autonomous systems, where precise and
efficient edge recognition is crucial.

TL;DR: 论文提出了Video-TT测试，用于评估视频大语言模型在理解和解释真实世界视频时的正确性和鲁棒性，发现其与人类表现存在显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型的评测基准未能充分反映其在视频理解中的正确性和鲁棒性与人类智能的差距。

Method: 通过构建Video-TT测试集，包含1,000个YouTube Shorts视频，每个视频配有一个开放式问题和四个对抗性问题。

Result: 评估结果显示，视频大语言模型在视频理解中的表现与人类存在显著差距。

Conclusion: Video-TT揭示了视频大语言模型在复杂视觉叙事理解和对抗性问题处理上的不足，为未来改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Human intelligence requires correctness and robustness, with the former being
foundational for the latter. In video understanding, correctness ensures the
accurate interpretation of visual content, and robustness maintains consistent
performance in challenging conditions. Despite advances in video large language
models (video LLMs), existing benchmarks inadequately reflect the gap between
these models and human intelligence in maintaining correctness and robustness
in video interpretation. We introduce the Video Thinking Test (Video-TT), to
assess if video LLMs can interpret real-world videos as effectively as humans.
Video-TT reflects genuine gaps in understanding complex visual narratives, and
evaluates robustness against natural adversarial questions. Video-TT comprises
1,000 YouTube Shorts videos, each with one open-ended question and four
adversarial questions that probe visual and narrative complexity. Our
evaluation shows a significant gap between video LLMs and human performance.

Motivation: 传统波动方程数值求解器计算量大且不稳定，限制了实时成像应用；现有神经算子数据集过于简化，无法满足实际成像需求。

Method: 提出OpenBreastUS数据集，包含8000个解剖学真实的人体乳腺模型和1600万次频域波动模拟，用于评估神经算子的性能。

Conclusion: OpenBreastUS填补了理论与实际成像之间的差距，推动了神经算子在医学成像中的实际应用。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient simulation of wave equations is crucial in
computational wave imaging applications, such as ultrasound computed tomography
(USCT), which reconstructs tissue material properties from observed scattered
waves. Traditional numerical solvers for wave equations are computationally
intensive and often unstable, limiting their practical applications for
quasi-real-time image reconstruction. Neural operators offer an innovative
approach by accelerating PDE solving using neural networks; however, their
effectiveness in realistic imaging is limited because existing datasets
oversimplify real-world complexity. In this paper, we present OpenBreastUS, a
large-scale wave equation dataset designed to bridge the gap between
theoretical equations and practical imaging applications. OpenBreastUS includes
8,000 anatomically realistic human breast phantoms and over 16 million
frequency-domain wave simulations using real USCT configurations. It enables a
comprehensive benchmarking of popular neural operators for both forward
simulation and inverse imaging tasks, allowing analysis of their performance,
scalability, and generalization capabilities. By offering a realistic and
extensive dataset, OpenBreastUS not only serves as a platform for developing
innovative neural PDE solvers but also facilitates their deployment in
real-world medical imaging problems. For the first time, we demonstrate
efficient in vivo imaging of the human breast using neural operator solvers.

TL;DR: EBA-AI是一个基于伦理和偏见的AI框架，用于水下图像增强，解决数据集偏见、高计算成本和透明度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下图像增强对海洋保护至关重要，但现有AI模型存在数据集偏见、高计算成本和透明度不足的问题。

Method: EBA-AI利用CLIP嵌入检测和减轻数据集偏见，并采用自适应处理优化能效，同时保持图像增强质量。

Result: 实验表明，PSNR仅下降1.0 dB，但计算效率显著提升，适用于实时大规模海洋监测。

Conclusion: EBA-AI在效率、公平性和可解释性方面优于现有方法，为可持续的海洋保护提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Underwater image enhancement is vital for marine conservation, particularly
coral reef monitoring. However, AI-based enhancement models often face dataset
bias, high computational costs, and lack of transparency, leading to potential
misinterpretations. This paper introduces EBA-AI, an ethics-guided bias-aware
AI framework to address these challenges. EBA-AI leverages CLIP embeddings to
detect and mitigate dataset bias, ensuring balanced representation across
varied underwater environments. It also integrates adaptive processing to
optimize energy efficiency, significantly reducing GPU usage while maintaining
competitive enhancement quality. Experiments on LSUI400, Oceanex, and UIEB100
show that while PSNR drops by a controlled 1.0 dB, computational savings enable
real-time feasibility for large-scale marine monitoring. Additionally,
uncertainty estimation and explainability techniques enhance trust in AI-driven
environmental decisions. Comparisons with CycleGAN, FunIEGAN, RAUNENet,
WaterNet, UGAN, PUGAN, and UTUIE validate EBA-AI's effectiveness in balancing
efficiency, fairness, and interpretability in underwater image processing. By
addressing key limitations of AI-driven enhancement, this work contributes to
sustainable, bias-aware, and computationally efficient marine conservation
efforts. For interactive visualizations, animations, source code, and access to

TL;DR: OmniVTON是一种无需训练的通用虚拟试穿框架，通过解耦服装和姿态条件，实现跨场景的高保真纹理和姿态一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有虚拟试穿技术存在跨域泛化能力不足或数据偏差问题，缺乏统一的无训练解决方案。

Method: 提出服装先验生成机制和连续边界缝合技术以保留细节，利用DDIM反演实现精确姿态对齐。

Result: 实验表明OmniVTON在多样化数据集和场景中表现优异，首次实现多人物虚拟试穿。

Conclusion: OmniVTON通过解耦条件解决了扩散模型的多条件偏差问题，成为首个跨场景通用的虚拟试穿框架。

Abstract: Image-based Virtual Try-On (VTON) techniques rely on either supervised
in-shop approaches, which ensure high fidelity but struggle with cross-domain
generalization, or unsupervised in-the-wild methods, which improve adaptability
but remain constrained by data biases and limited universality. A unified,
training-free solution that works across both scenarios remains an open
challenge. We propose OmniVTON, the first training-free universal VTON
framework that decouples garment and pose conditioning to achieve both texture
fidelity and pose consistency across diverse settings. To preserve garment
details, we introduce a garment prior generation mechanism that aligns clothing
with the body, followed by continuous boundary stitching technique to achieve
fine-grained texture retention. For precise pose alignment, we utilize DDIM
inversion to capture structural cues while suppressing texture interference,
ensuring accurate body alignment independent of the original image textures. By
disentangling garment and pose constraints, OmniVTON eliminates the bias
inherent in diffusion models when handling multiple conditions simultaneously.
Experimental results demonstrate that OmniVTON achieves superior performance
across diverse datasets, garment types, and application scenarios. Notably, it
is the first framework capable of multi-human VTON, enabling realistic garment
transfer across multiple individuals in a single scene. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PanTiny，一种轻量级单步全色锐化框架，通过多数据集联合训练和复合损失函数提升性能与泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战当前全色锐化领域大模型计算开销高、泛化能力差的问题。

Method: 设计PanTiny框架，采用多数据集联合训练和复合损失函数。

Result: PanTiny在性能和效率上优于大型专用模型，泛化能力显著提升。

Conclusion: 倡导高效、泛化强且数据敏感的全色锐化模型设计方向。

Abstract: The field of pan-sharpening has recently seen a trend towards increasingly
large and complex models, often trained on single, specific satellite datasets.
This approach, however, leads to high computational overhead and poor
generalization on full resolution data, a paradigm we challenge in this paper.
In response to this issue, we propose PanTiny, a lightweight, single-step
pan-sharpening framework designed for both efficiency and robust performance.
More critically, we introduce multiple-in-one training paradigm, where a
single, compact model is trained simultaneously on three distinct satellite
datasets (WV2, WV3, and GF2) with different resolution and spectral
information. Our experiments show that this unified training strategy not only
simplifies deployment but also significantly boosts generalization on
full-resolution data. Further, we introduce a universally powerful composite
loss function that elevates the performance of almost all of models for
pan-sharpening, pushing state-of-the-art metrics into a new era. Our PanTiny
model, benefiting from these innovations, achieves a superior
performance-to-efficiency balance, outperforming most larger, specialized
models. Through extensive ablation studies, we validate that principled
engineering in model design, training paradigms, and loss functions can surpass
brute-force scaling. Our work advocates for a community-wide shift towards
creating efficient, generalizable, and data-conscious models for
pan-sharpening. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StableAnimator++ 是一种基于视频扩散模型的框架，通过可学习的姿态对齐和身份保持模块，解决了现有方法在身份一致性上的不足，无需后处理即可生成高质量动画。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的人体图像动画扩散模型在参考图像和驱动视频差异较大时难以保持身份一致性，因此需要一种新的方法来提升身份保持能力。

Method: StableAnimator++ 结合了可学习的姿态对齐模块（基于 SVD 的相似变换矩阵）、全局内容感知的人脸编码器和分布感知的身份适配器，并在推理阶段引入基于 HJB 的人脸优化。

Result: 实验表明，StableAnimator++ 在定性和定量上均优于现有方法，能够有效保持身份一致性并生成高质量动画。

Conclusion: StableAnimator++ 通过创新的模块设计和优化策略，显著提升了身份一致性，为人体图像动画领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Current diffusion models for human image animation often struggle to maintain
identity (ID) consistency, especially when the reference image and driving
video differ significantly in body size or position. We introduce
StableAnimator++, the first ID-preserving video diffusion framework with
learnable pose alignment, capable of generating high-quality videos conditioned
on a reference image and a pose sequence without any post-processing. Building
upon a video diffusion model, StableAnimator++ contains carefully designed
modules for both training and inference, striving for identity consistency. In
particular, StableAnimator++ first uses learnable layers to predict the
similarity transformation matrices between the reference image and the driven
poses via injecting guidance from Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). These
matrices align the driven poses with the reference image, mitigating
misalignment to a great extent. StableAnimator++ then computes image and face
embeddings using off-the-shelf encoders, refining the face embeddings via a
global content-aware Face Encoder. To further maintain ID, we introduce a
distribution-aware ID Adapter that counteracts interference caused by temporal
layers while preserving ID via distribution alignment. During the inference
stage, we propose a novel Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) based face optimization
integrated into the denoising process, guiding the diffusion trajectory for
enhanced facial fidelity. Experiments on benchmarks show the effectiveness of
StableAnimator++ both qualitatively and quantitatively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨生成模型是否能掌握文本图像生成和编辑的复杂性，推动通用模型内化这些能力。

Method: 选取33个代表性任务，分为五类，评估六种闭源和开源模型，使用定制的高质量图像输入和提示。

Result: 揭示了当前生成模型在OCR任务中的弱点，强调需要将文本图像生成和编辑内化为通用模型的基础能力。

Conclusion: 呼吁社区关注通用模型内化文本图像生成和编辑能力的重要性，并提供了持续更新的评估资源。

Abstract: Text image is a unique and crucial information medium that integrates visual
aesthetics and linguistic semantics in modern e-society. Due to their subtlety
and complexity, the generation of text images represents a challenging and
evolving frontier in the image generation field. The recent surge of
specialized image generators (\emph{e.g.}, Flux-series) and unified generative
models (\emph{e.g.}, GPT-4o), which demonstrate exceptional fidelity, raises a
natural question: can they master the intricacies of text image generation and
editing? Motivated by this, we assess current state-of-the-art generative
models' capabilities in terms of text image generation and editing. We
incorporate various typical optical character recognition (OCR) tasks into our
evaluation and broaden the concept of text-based generation tasks into OCR
generative tasks. We select 33 representative tasks and categorize them into
five categories: document, handwritten text, scene text, artistic text, and
complex \& layout-rich text. For comprehensive evaluation, we examine six
models across both closed-source and open-source domains, using tailored,
high-quality image inputs and prompts. Through this evaluation, we draw crucial
observations and identify the weaknesses of current generative models for OCR
tasks. We argue that photorealistic text image generation and editing should be
internalized as foundational skills into general-domain generative models,
rather than being delegated to specialized solutions, and we hope this
empirical analysis can provide valuable insights for the community to achieve
this goal. This evaluation is online and will be continuously updated at our
GitHub repository.

Motivation: 无人机视觉地点识别面临大规模高空数据集稀缺和图像旋转模糊的挑战，限制了模型的泛化能力。

Result: LASED训练的模型召回率显著提高，可转向CNN比传统网络平均提升12%召回率。

Conclusion: 结合大规模数据集和旋转等变网络，显著提升了无人机视觉地点识别的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (vPR) plays a crucial role in Unmanned Aerial
Vehicle (UAV) navigation, enabling robust localization across diverse
environments. Despite significant advancements, aerial vPR faces unique
challenges due to the limited availability of large-scale, high-altitude
datasets, which limits model generalization, along with the inherent rotational
ambiguity in UAV imagery. To address these challenges, we introduce LASED, a
large-scale aerial dataset with approximately one million images,
systematically sampled from 170,000 unique locations throughout Estonia over a
decade, offering extensive geographic and temporal diversity. Its structured
design ensures clear place separation significantly enhancing model training
for aerial scenarios. Furthermore, we propose the integration of steerable
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to explicitly handle rotational variance,
leveraging their inherent rotational equivariance to produce robust,
orientation-invariant feature representations. Our extensive benchmarking
demonstrates that models trained on LASED achieve significantly higher recall
compared to those trained on smaller, less diverse datasets, highlighting the
benefits of extensive geographic coverage and temporal diversity. Moreover,
steerable CNNs effectively address rotational ambiguity inherent in aerial
imagery, consistently outperforming conventional convolutional architectures,
achieving on average 12\% recall improvement over the best-performing
non-steerable network. By combining structured, large-scale datasets with
rotation-equivariant neural networks, our approach significantly enhances model
robustness and generalization for aerial vPR.

TL;DR: 论文提出了首个ESD出血源数据集BleedOrigin-Bench和双阶段检测-跟踪框架BleedOrigin-Net，用于实时定位和跟踪出血源，显著提升了准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ESD术中出血的实时定位和跟踪需求迫切，但现有AI方法仅关注出血区域分割，缺乏出血源检测和动态跟踪能力，且缺乏专用数据集。

Method: 提出BleedOrigin-Bench数据集和BleedOrigin-Net双阶段框架，结合检测与跟踪技术，覆盖出血源定位的全流程。

Result: BleedOrigin-Net在出血起始检测、初始源定位和点跟踪方面分别达到96.85%、70.24%和96.11%的准确率，表现优异。

Conclusion: 研究填补了ESD出血源检测与跟踪的空白，为AI辅助手术系统提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Intraoperative bleeding during Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) poses
significant risks, demanding precise, real-time localization and continuous
monitoring of the bleeding source for effective hemostatic intervention. In
particular, endoscopists have to repeatedly flush to clear blood, allowing only
milliseconds to identify bleeding sources, an inefficient process that prolongs
operations and elevates patient risks. However, current Artificial Intelligence
(AI) methods primarily focus on bleeding region segmentation, overlooking the
critical need for accurate bleeding source detection and temporal tracking in
the challenging ESD environment, which is marked by frequent visual
obstructions and dynamic scene changes. This gap is widened by the lack of
specialized datasets, hindering the development of robust AI-assisted guidance
systems. To address these challenges, we introduce BleedOrigin-Bench, the first
comprehensive ESD bleeding source dataset, featuring 1,771 expert-annotated
bleeding sources across 106,222 frames from 44 procedures, supplemented with
39,755 pseudo-labeled frames. This benchmark covers 8 anatomical sites and 6
challenging clinical scenarios. We also present BleedOrigin-Net, a novel
dual-stage detection-tracking framework for the bleeding source localization in
ESD procedures, addressing the complete workflow from bleeding onset detection
to continuous spatial tracking. We compare with widely-used object detection
models (YOLOv11/v12), multimodal large language models, and point tracking
methods. Extensive evaluation demonstrates state-of-the-art performance,
achieving 96.85% frame-level accuracy ($\pm\leq8$ frames) for bleeding onset
detection, 70.24% pixel-level accuracy ($\leq100$ px) for initial source
detection, and 96.11% pixel-level accuracy ($\leq100$ px) for point tracking.

Conclusion: LoopNet有效提升了SLAM闭环检测的性能，同时开源了代码和数据集。

Abstract: One of the main challenges in the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
(SLAM) loop closure problem is the recognition of previously visited places. In
this work, we tackle the two main problems of real-time SLAM systems: 1) loop
closure detection accuracy and 2) real-time computation constraints on the
embedded hardware. Our LoopNet method is based on a multitasking variant of the
classical ResNet architecture, adapted for online retraining on a dynamic
visual dataset and optimized for embedded devices. The online retraining is
designed using a few-shot learning approach. The architecture provides both an
index into the queried visual dataset, and a measurement of the prediction
quality. Moreover, by leveraging DISK (DIStinctive Keypoints) descriptors,
LoopNet surpasses the limitations of handcrafted features and traditional deep
learning methods, offering better performance under varying conditions. Code is
available at https://github.com/RovisLab/LoopNet. Additinally, we introduce a
new loop closure benchmarking dataset, coined LoopDB, which is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长时视觉规划中数据稀缺和动作空间建模的挑战。

Method: 引入Auxiliary Task Augmentation和多令牌预测（Multi-token Prediction）。

Result: 在COIN和CrossTask数据集上分别提升7.3%和3.4%，在Ego4D任务中表现媲美SOTA。

Conclusion: VideoPlan方法有效提升了视觉规划任务的性能。

Abstract: Visual Planning for Assistance (VPA) aims to predict a sequence of user
actions required to achieve a specified goal based on a video showing the
user's progress. Although recent advances in multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) have shown promising results in video understanding, long-horizon
visual planning remains a challenging problem. We identify two challenges in
training large MLLMs for video-based planning tasks: (1) scarcity of procedural
annotations, limiting the model's ability to learn procedural task dynamics
effectively, and (2) inefficiency of next-token prediction objective to
explicitly capture the structured action space for visual planning when
compared to free-form, natural language. To tackle data scarcity, we introduce
Auxiliary Task Augmentation. We design and train our model on auxiliary tasks
relevant to long-horizon video-based planning (e.g., goal prediction) to
augment the model's planning ability. To more explicitly model the structured
action space unique to visual planning tasks, we leverage Multi-token
Prediction, extending traditional next-token prediction by using multiple heads
to predict multiple future tokens during training. Our approach, VideoPlan,
achieves state-of-the-art VPA performance on the COIN and CrossTask datasets,
surpassing prior methods by 7.3% and 3.4%, respectively, when predicting 3
future actions. We further extend our method to the challenging Ego4D Long-term
Action Anticipation task, and show that it is on par with the state-of-the-art
approaches despite not using specialized egocentric features. Code will be made
available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件传感器数据稀疏且异步，传统密集张量转换方法会丧失其优势，而现有图方法对时空动态建模不足，限制了性能。

Method: 构建解耦的空间图（使用B样条基函数建模全局结构）和时间图（基于运动向量的注意力机制建模局部动态），替代昂贵的3D核。

Result: 在Gen1和eTraM数据集上，检测精度提升6%，速度提升5倍，参数减少且计算成本不变。

Conclusion: 结构化图建模能有效提升异步视觉任务的性能。

Abstract: Event-based sensors offer high temporal resolution and low latency by
generating sparse, asynchronous data. However, converting this irregular data
into dense tensors for use in standard neural networks diminishes these
inherent advantages, motivating research into graph representations. While such
methods preserve sparsity and support asynchronous inference, their performance
on downstream tasks remains limited due to suboptimal modeling of
spatiotemporal dynamics. In this work, we propose a novel spatiotemporal
multigraph representation to better capture spatial structure and temporal
changes. Our approach constructs two decoupled graphs: a spatial graph
leveraging B-spline basis functions to model global structure, and a temporal
graph utilizing motion vector-based attention for local dynamic changes. This
design enables the use of efficient 2D kernels in place of computationally
expensive 3D kernels. We evaluate our method on the Gen1 automotive and eTraM
datasets for event-based object detection, achieving over a 6% improvement in
detection accuracy compared to previous graph-based works, with a 5x speedup,
reduced parameter count, and no increase in computational cost. These results
highlight the effectiveness of structured graph modeling for asynchronous
vision. Project page: eventbasedvision.github.io/eGSMV.

Motivation: 解决现有方法在处理大规模3D网格（如衣物和手部几何）时的效率和扩展性问题。

Conclusion: MeshMamba在3D网格生成和重建任务中表现出高效性和扩展性，优于现有方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce MeshMamba, a neural network model for learning 3D
articulated mesh models by employing the recently proposed Mamba State Space
Models (Mamba-SSMs). MeshMamba is efficient and scalable in handling a large
number of input tokens, enabling the generation and reconstruction of body mesh
models with more than 10,000 vertices, capturing clothing and hand geometries.
The key to effectively learning MeshMamba is the serialization technique of
mesh vertices into orderings that are easily processed by Mamba. This is
achieved by sorting the vertices based on body part annotations or the 3D
vertex locations of a template mesh, such that the ordering respects the
structure of articulated shapes. Based on MeshMamba, we design 1) MambaDiff3D,
a denoising diffusion model for generating 3D articulated meshes and 2)
Mamba-HMR, a 3D human mesh recovery model that reconstructs a human body shape
and pose from a single image. Experimental results showed that MambaDiff3D can
generate dense 3D human meshes in clothes, with grasping hands, etc., and
outperforms previous approaches in the 3D human shape generation task.
Additionally, Mamba-HMR extends the capabilities of previous non-parametric
human mesh recovery approaches, which were limited to handling body-only poses
using around 500 vertex tokens, to the whole-body setting with face and hands,
while achieving competitive performance in (near) real-time.

Conclusion: N-JEPA成功结合了扩散噪声与自监督学习，为下游任务提供了更强的表示能力。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has become an incredibly successful method for
feature learning, widely applied to many downstream tasks. It has proven
especially effective for discriminative tasks, surpassing the trending
generative models. However, generative models perform better in image
generation and detail enhancement. Thus, it is natural for us to find a
connection between SSL and generative models to further enhance the
representation capacity of SSL. As generative models can create new samples by
approximating the data distribution, such modeling should also lead to a
semantic understanding of the raw visual data, which is necessary for
recognition tasks. This enlightens us to combine the core principle of the
diffusion model: diffusion noise, with SSL to learn a competitive recognition
model. Specifically, diffusion noise can be viewed as a particular state of
mask that reveals a close relationship between masked image modeling (MIM) and
diffusion models. In this paper, we propose N-JEPA (Noise-based JEPA) to
incorporate diffusion noise into MIM by the position embedding of masked
tokens. The multi-level noise schedule is a series of feature augmentations to
further enhance the robustness of our model. We perform a comprehensive study
to confirm its effectiveness in the classification of downstream tasks. Codes

Abstract: Advancements in 3D vision have increased the impact of blood vessel modeling
on medical applications. However, accurately representing the complex geometry
and topology of blood vessels remains a challenge due to their intricate
branching patterns, curvatures, and irregular shapes. In this study, we propose
a hierarchical part-based frame work for 3D vessel generation that separates
the global binary tree-like topology from local geometric details. Our approach
proceeds in three stages: (1) key graph generation to model the overall
hierarchical struc ture, (2) vessel segment generation conditioned on geometric
properties, and (3) hierarchical vessel assembly by integrating the local
segments according to the global key graph. We validate our framework on real
world datasets, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods in
modeling complex vascular networks. This work marks the first successful
application of a part-based generative approach for 3D vessel modeling, setting
a new benchmark for vascular data generation. The code is available at:

*Krishna Kanth Nakka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于稀疏自编码器（SAE）的可解释性方法，用于分析乳腺影像中的基础模型（Mammo-CLIP），揭示其决策过程与临床相关概念的关联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险领域（如医学影像）中，模型决策的可解释性对临床应用至关重要。本文旨在通过SAE方法深入理解乳腺影像基础模型的内部机制。

Method: 训练了一个基于Mammo-CLIP的patch级稀疏自编码器（Mammo-SAE），用于识别和探测与临床相关乳腺概念（如肿块和可疑钙化）相关的潜在特征。

Result: 研究发现，SAE潜在空间中激活度最高的神经元通常与真实区域对齐，并揭示了影响模型决策的混杂因素。此外，还分析了模型在下游任务中依赖的潜在神经元。

Conclusion: 研究表明，可解释的SAE潜在表征为理解乳腺影像基础模型的内部工作机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Interpretability is critical in high-stakes domains such as medical imaging,
where understanding model decisions is essential for clinical adoption. In this
work, we introduce Sparse Autoencoder (SAE)-based interpretability to breast
imaging by analyzing {Mammo-CLIP}, a vision--language foundation model
pretrained on large-scale mammogram image--report pairs. We train a patch-level
\texttt{Mammo-SAE} on Mammo-CLIP to identify and probe latent features
associated with clinically relevant breast concepts such as \textit{mass} and
\textit{suspicious calcification}. Our findings reveal that top activated class
level latent neurons in the SAE latent space often tend to align with ground
truth regions, and also uncover several confounding factors influencing the
model's decision-making process. Additionally, we analyze which latent neurons
the model relies on during downstream finetuning for improving the breast
concept prediction. This study highlights the promise of interpretable SAE
latent representations in providing deeper insight into the internal workings
of foundation models at every layer for breast imaging.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DINO预训练模型与原型分类器结合，在跨域少样本学习中表现优于最新SOTA方法。提出Coalescent Projection（CP）和伪类生成方法，解决过拟合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决跨域少样本学习中因参数过多导致的过拟合问题，提升模型性能。

Method: 提出Coalescent Projection（CP）替代软提示，结合自监督变换（SSTs）生成伪类，仅依赖基域数据。

Result: 在BSCD-FSL基准测试的极端域偏移场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: CP和伪类生成方法有效解决了过拟合问题，提升了跨域少样本学习的性能。

Abstract: Despite the progress in Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning (CD-FSL), a model
pre-trained with DINO combined with a prototypical classifier outperforms the
latest SOTA methods. A crucial limitation that needs to be overcome is that
updating too many parameters of the transformers leads to overfitting due to
the scarcity of labeled samples. To address this challenge, we propose a new
concept, Coalescent Projection (CP), as an effective successor to soft prompts.
Additionally, we propose a novel pseudo-class generation method combined with
Self-Supervised Transformations (SSTs) that relies solely on the base domain to
prepare the network for encountering unseen samples from different domains. The
proposed method exhibits its effectiveness in comprehensive experiments on the
extreme domain shift scenario of the BSCD-FSL benchmark. Our code is published

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖训练过程，限制了实际应用，且未能充分利用扩散变换器的零样本潜力。

Result: 实验表明，FreeCus在零样本主题合成中表现优异，兼容现有修复和控制模块。

Conclusion: FreeCus成功解锁DiT的零样本能力，为设计和工作流提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: In light of recent breakthroughs in text-to-image (T2I) generation,
particularly with diffusion transformers (DiT), subject-driven technologies are
increasingly being employed for high-fidelity customized production that
preserves subject identity from reference inputs, enabling thrilling design
workflows and engaging entertainment. Existing alternatives typically require
either per-subject optimization via trainable text embeddings or training
specialized encoders for subject feature extraction on large-scale datasets.
Such dependencies on training procedures fundamentally constrain their
practical applications. More importantly, current methodologies fail to fully
leverage the inherent zero-shot potential of modern diffusion transformers
(e.g., the Flux series) for authentic subject-driven synthesis. To bridge this
gap, we propose FreeCus, a genuinely training-free framework that activates
DiT's capabilities through three key innovations: 1) We introduce a pivotal
attention sharing mechanism that captures the subject's layout integrity while
preserving crucial editing flexibility. 2) Through a straightforward analysis
of DiT's dynamic shifting, we propose an upgraded variant that significantly
improves fine-grained feature extraction. 3) We further integrate advanced
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to enrich cross-modal semantic
representations. Extensive experiments reflect that our method successfully
unlocks DiT's zero-shot ability for consistent subject synthesis across diverse
contexts, achieving state-of-the-art or comparable results compared to
approaches that require additional training. Notably, our framework
demonstrates seamless compatibility with existing inpainting pipelines and
control modules, facilitating more compelling experiences. Our code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于近似盲PnP的对应学习方法（MinCD-PnP），通过最小化2D和3D关键点之间的Chamfer距离，解决了传统差分PnP对噪声和异常值敏感的问题，并设计了轻量级多任务学习模块MinCD-Net。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统差分PnP在图像到点云（I2P）配准中对噪声和异常值高度敏感，影响了对应学习的有效性。受盲PnP对噪声和异常值的鲁棒性启发，作者提出了近似盲PnP的解决方案。

Method: 提出了MinCD-PnP方法，将盲PnP简化为最小化2D和3D关键点之间的Chamfer距离。设计了轻量级多任务学习模块MinCD-Net，可轻松集成到现有I2P配准架构中。

Result: 在多个数据集（7-Scenes、RGBD-V2、ScanNet等）上的实验表明，MinCD-Net优于现有方法，在跨场景和跨数据集设置中实现了更高的内点率（IR）和配准召回率（RR）。

Conclusion: MinCD-PnP和MinCD-Net有效解决了传统差分PnP的敏感性问题，提升了I2P配准的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Image-to-point-cloud (I2P) registration is a fundamental problem in computer
vision, focusing on establishing 2D-3D correspondences between an image and a
point cloud. The differential perspective-n-point (PnP) has been widely used to
supervise I2P registration networks by enforcing the projective constraints on
2D-3D correspondences. However, differential PnP is highly sensitive to noise
and outliers in the predicted correspondences. This issue hinders the
effectiveness of correspondence learning. Inspired by the robustness of blind
PnP against noise and outliers in correspondences, we propose an approximated
blind PnP based correspondence learning approach. To mitigate the high
computational cost of blind PnP, we simplify blind PnP to an amenable task of
minimizing Chamfer distance between learned 2D and 3D keypoints, called
MinCD-PnP. To effectively solve MinCD-PnP, we design a lightweight multi-task
learning module, named as MinCD-Net, which can be easily integrated into the
existing I2P registration architectures. Extensive experiments on 7-Scenes,
RGBD-V2, ScanNet, and self-collected datasets demonstrate that MinCD-Net
outperforms state-of-the-art methods and achieves a higher inlier ratio (IR)
and registration recall (RR) in both cross-scene and cross-dataset settings.

Motivation: 利用条件扩散模型在人类视觉感知对齐方面的优势，优化视频压缩的感知重建质量。

Method: 设计了多粒度条件模块、紧凑表示模块和多条件训练模块，以捕捉静态和动态信息并增强鲁棒性。

Result: 在FVD和LPIPS等感知质量指标上显著优于传统和神经编解码器，尤其在高压缩比下表现突出。

Conclusion: 条件扩散模型为视频压缩提供了感知优化的有效途径，尤其在高质量压缩场景中具有潜力。

Abstract: Perceptual studies demonstrate that conditional diffusion models excel at
reconstructing video content aligned with human visual perception. Building on
this insight, we propose a video compression framework that leverages
conditional diffusion models for perceptually optimized reconstruction.
Specifically, we reframe video compression as a conditional generation task,
where a generative model synthesizes video from sparse, yet informative
signals. Our approach introduces three key modules: (1) Multi-granular
conditioning that captures both static scene structure and dynamic
spatio-temporal cues; (2) Compact representations designed for efficient
transmission without sacrificing semantic richness; (3) Multi-condition
training with modality dropout and role-aware embeddings, which prevent
over-reliance on any single modality and enhance robustness. Extensive
experiments show that our method significantly outperforms both traditional and
neural codecs on perceptual quality metrics such as Fr\'echet Video Distance
(FVD) and LPIPS, especially under high compression ratios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生物识别系统检测方法的进步，攻击技术也日益复杂，传统深度学习模型在适应新攻击类型或环境变化时表现不佳，且需要大量训练数据。

Method: 提出了一种基于视觉语言模型（VLM）的上下文学习框架，用于检测物理呈现攻击和数字变形攻击。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在物理和数字攻击检测中表现优异，优于某些传统CNN模型，且无需资源密集型训练。

Conclusion: 该框架为生物识别系统中的攻击检测提供了一种有前景的通用化改进工具。

Abstract: Recent advances in biometric systems have significantly improved the
detection and prevention of fraudulent activities. However, as detection
methods improve, attack techniques become increasingly sophisticated. Attacks
on face recognition systems can be broadly divided into physical and digital
approaches. Traditionally, deep learning models have been the primary defence
against such attacks. While these models perform exceptionally well in
scenarios for which they have been trained, they often struggle to adapt to
different types of attacks or varying environmental conditions. These
subsystems require substantial amounts of training data to achieve reliable
performance, yet biometric data collection faces significant challenges,
including privacy concerns and the logistical difficulties of capturing diverse
attack scenarios under controlled conditions. This work investigates the
application of Vision Language Models (VLM) and proposes an in-context learning
framework for detecting physical presentation attacks and digital morphing
attacks in biometric systems. Focusing on open-source models, the first
systematic framework for the quantitative evaluation of VLMs in
security-critical scenarios through in-context learning techniques is
established. The experimental evaluation conducted on freely available
databases demonstrates that the proposed subsystem achieves competitive
performance for physical and digital attack detection, outperforming some of
the traditional CNNs without resource-intensive training. The experimental
results validate the proposed framework as a promising tool for improving
generalisation in attack detection.

Motivation: 解决指纹匹配在多样捕获条件下的鲁棒性和准确性挑战。

Method: 基于细节点的局部密集表示，提取三维张量描述符，结合空间结构和语义特征。

Result: 在多种指纹数据集上实现最优性能，兼具高效计算。

Conclusion: DMD方法在指纹识别中表现出高效性和泛化能力，适用于大规模应用。

Abstract: Fingerprint matching under diverse capture conditions remains a fundamental
challenge in biometric recognition. To achieve robust and accurate performance
in such scenarios, we propose DMD, a minutiae-anchored local dense
representation which captures both fine-grained ridge textures and
discriminative minutiae features in a spatially structured manner.
Specifically, descriptors are extracted from local patches centered and
oriented on each detected minutia, forming a three-dimensional tensor, where
two dimensions represent spatial locations on the fingerprint plane and the
third encodes semantic features. This representation explicitly captures
abstract features of local image patches, enabling a multi-level, fine-grained
description that aggregates information from multiple minutiae and their
surrounding ridge structures. Furthermore, thanks to its strong spatial
correspondence with the patch image, DMD allows for the use of foreground
segmentation masks to identify valid descriptor regions. During matching,
comparisons are then restricted to overlapping foreground areas, improving
efficiency and robustness. Extensive experiments on rolled, plain, parital,
contactless, and latent fingerprint datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalizability of the proposed method. It achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
across multiple benchmarks while maintaining high computational efficiency,
showing strong potential for large-scale fingerprint recognition. Corresponding
code is available at https://github.com/Yu-Yy/DMD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前少样本目标检测方法在有限训练样本下难以准确提取有效特征，尤其是通道权重的有效性不足。

Method: 设计了SCSM模块，包含空间特征建模（SFM）和基于Mamba的通道状态建模（CSM），以平衡空间与通道关系并学习通道相关性。

Result: 在VOC和COCO数据集上的实验表明，SCSM模块提升了特征表示质量，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: SCSM模块通过建模通道相关性，有效解决了FSOD中的特征提取问题，显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Due to the limited training samples in few-shot object detection (FSOD), we
observe that current methods may struggle to accurately extract effective
features from each channel. Specifically, this issue manifests in two aspects:
i) channels with high weights may not necessarily be effective, and ii)
channels with low weights may still hold significant value. To handle this
problem, we consider utilizing the inter-channel correlation to facilitate the
novel model's adaptation process to novel conditions, ensuring the model can
correctly highlight effective channels and rectify those incorrect ones. Since
the channel sequence is also 1-dimensional, its similarity with the temporal
sequence inspires us to take Mamba for modeling the correlation in the channel
sequence. Based on this concept, we propose a Spatial-Channel State Space
Modeling (SCSM) module for spatial-channel state modeling, which highlights the
effective patterns and rectifies those ineffective ones in feature channels. In
SCSM, we design the Spatial Feature Modeling (SFM) module to balance the
learning of spatial relationships and channel relationships, and then introduce
the Channel State Modeling (CSM) module based on Mamba to learn correlation in
channels. Extensive experiments on the VOC and COCO datasets show that the SCSM
module enables the novel detector to improve the quality of focused feature
representation in channels and achieve state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Depth estimation is a fundamental task in computer vision with diverse
applications. Recent advancements in deep learning have led to powerful depth
foundation models (DFMs), yet their evaluation remains challenging due to
inconsistencies in existing protocols. Traditional benchmarks rely on
alignment-based metrics that introduce biases, favor certain depth
representations, and complicate fair comparisons. In this work, we propose
BenchDepth, a new benchmark that evaluates DFMs through five carefully selected
downstream proxy tasks: depth completion, stereo matching, monocular
feed-forward 3D scene reconstruction, SLAM, and vision-language spatial
understanding. Unlike conventional evaluation protocols, our approach assesses
DFMs based on their practical utility in real-world applications, bypassing
problematic alignment procedures. We benchmark eight state-of-the-art DFMs and
provide an in-depth analysis of key findings and observations. We hope our work
sparks further discussion in the community on best practices for depth model
evaluation and paves the way for future research and advancements in depth
estimation.

Conclusion: ExDD框架通过双重分布建模和合成数据生成，显著提升了工业缺陷检测的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Industrial defect detection systems face critical limitations when confined
to one-class anomaly detection paradigms, which assume uniform outlier
distributions and struggle with data scarcity in realworld manufacturing
environments. We present ExDD (Explicit Dual Distribution), a novel framework
that transcends these limitations by explicitly modeling dual feature
distributions. Our approach leverages parallel memory banks that capture the
distinct statistical properties of both normality and anomalous patterns,
addressing the fundamental flaw of uniform outlier assumptions. To overcome
data scarcity, we employ latent diffusion models with domain-specific textual
conditioning, generating in-distribution synthetic defects that preserve
industrial context. Our neighborhood-aware ratio scoring mechanism elegantly
fuses complementary distance metrics, amplifying signals in regions exhibiting
both deviation from normality and similarity to known defect patterns.
Experimental validation on KSDD2 demonstrates superior performance (94.2%
I-AUROC, 97.7% P-AUROC), with optimal augmentation at 100 synthetic samples.

Abstract: Pavement defect detection faces critical challenges including limited

high variability in defect appearances across different road conditions. We
propose RoadFusion, a framework that addresses these limitations through
synthetic anomaly generation with dual-path feature adaptation. A latent

Abstract: The state of the art in human-centric computer vision achieves high accuracy
and robustness across a diverse range of tasks. The most effective models in
this domain have billions of parameters, thus requiring extremely large
datasets, expensive training regimes, and compute-intensive inference. In this
paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to train models on much smaller but
high-fidelity synthetic datasets, with no loss in accuracy and higher
efficiency. Using synthetic training data provides us with excellent levels of
detail and perfect labels, while providing strong guarantees for data
provenance, usage rights, and user consent. Procedural data synthesis also
provides us with explicit control on data diversity, that we can use to address
unfairness in the models we train. Extensive quantitative assessment on real
input images demonstrates accuracy of our models on three dense prediction
tasks: depth estimation, surface normal estimation, and soft foreground
segmentation. Our models require only a fraction of the cost of training and
inference when compared with foundational models of similar accuracy. Our
human-centric synthetic dataset and trained models are available at

Conclusion: ORSANet显著提升了遮挡条件下的FER性能，并提供了首个遮挡专用数据集。

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) is a challenging task due to pervasive
occlusion and dataset biases. Especially when facial information is partially
occluded, existing FER models struggle to extract effective facial features,
leading to inaccurate classifications. In response, we present ORSANet, which
introduces the following three key contributions: First, we introduce auxiliary
multi-modal semantic guidance to disambiguate facial occlusion and learn
high-level semantic knowledge, which is two-fold: 1) we introduce semantic
segmentation maps as dense semantics prior to generate semantics-enhanced
facial representations; 2) we introduce facial landmarks as sparse geometric
prior to mitigate intrinsic noises in FER, such as identity and gender biases.
Second, to facilitate the effective incorporation of these two multi-modal
priors, we customize a Multi-scale Cross-interaction Module (MCM) to adaptively
fuse the landmark feature and semantics-enhanced representations within
different scales. Third, we design a Dynamic Adversarial Repulsion Enhancement
Loss (DARELoss) that dynamically adjusts the margins of ambiguous classes,
further enhancing the model's ability to distinguish similar expressions. We
further construct the first occlusion-oriented FER dataset to facilitate
specialized robustness analysis on various real-world occlusion conditions,
dubbed Occlu-FER. Extensive experiments on both public benchmarks and Occlu-FER
demonstrate that our proposed ORSANet achieves SOTA recognition performance.

Abstract: Surgical phase recognition plays a crucial role in surgical workflow
analysis, enabling various applications such as surgical monitoring, skill
assessment, and workflow optimization. Despite significant advancements in deep
learning-based surgical phase recognition, these models remain inherently
opaque, making it difficult to understand how they make decisions. This lack of
interpretability hinders trust and makes it challenging to debug the model. To
address this challenge, we propose SurgX, a novel concept-based explanation
framework that enhances the interpretability of surgical phase recognition
models by associating neurons with relevant concepts. In this paper, we
introduce the process of selecting representative example sequences for
neurons, constructing a concept set tailored to the surgical video dataset,
associating neurons with concepts and identifying neurons crucial for
predictions. Through extensive experiments on two surgical phase recognition
models, we validate our method and analyze the explanation for prediction. This
highlights the potential of our method in explaining surgical phase
recognition. The code is available at https://github.com/ailab-kyunghee/SurgX

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法，显著降低计算资源消耗。

Conclusion: EgoPrune适用于边缘设备，展示了实际部署的高效性。

Abstract: Egomotion videos are first-person recordings where the view changes
continuously due to the agent's movement. As they serve as the primary visual
input for embodied AI agents, making egomotion video reasoning more efficient
is therefore essential for real-world deployment. Recent advances in
vision-language models have enabled strong multimodal reasoning capabilities,
but their computational cost remains prohibitive for long, redundant video
inputs. Existing token pruning methods, typically designed for third-person
videos, fail to leverage the spatiotemporal continuity and motion constraints
inherent in egomotion settings. To address this, we propose EgoPrune, a
training-free token pruning method tailored for egomotion video reasoning.
EgoPrune comprises three components: a keyframe selector adapted from EmbodiedR
for temporally efficient sampling; Perspective-Aware Redundancy Filtering
(PARF), which aligns visual tokens using perspective transformations and
removes redundant tokens; and a Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR)-based token
selector that jointly considers visual-text relevance and intra-frame
diversity. Experiments on two egomotion video benchmarks show that EgoPrune
consistently outperforms prior training-free methods across various pruning
ratios while significantly reducing FLOPs, memory usage, and latency. Moreover,
we deploy EgoPrune on an embodied agent equipped with a Jetson Orin NX 16GB
edge device, demonstrating its real-world efficiency and suitability for
on-device egomotion video reasoning.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为RAda的简单有效方法，通过动态校准融合表示来优化视觉语言模型的微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常单独优化文本或视觉表示，而忽略了融合表示在决策中的关键作用。

Method: RAda使用轻量级注意力层生成学习掩码，动态调整融合表示中每个元素的贡献。

Result: 实验表明，RAda在多种设置下均能提升基线性能，且代码简洁高效。

Conclusion: RAda是一种通用的微调技术，能够在不显著修改中间特征的情况下提升模型性能。

Abstract: Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, achieve remarkable
zero-shot performance, yet their downstream potential hinges on effective
fine-tuning. Most adaptation methods typically focus on refining representation
from separate modalities (text or vision) but neglect the critical role of
their fused representations in the decision-making process, \emph{\ie} rational
matrix that drives the final prediction. To bridge the gap, we propose a simple
yet effective \textbf{R}ational \textbf{Ada}ptaion ({RAda}) to explicitly
exploit the final fused representation during fine-tuning. RAda employs a
learned mask, obtained from a lightweight attention layer attached at the end
of a VLM, to dynamically calibrate the contribution of each element in the
rational matrix, enabling targeted adjustments to the final cross-modal
interactions without incurring costly modifications to intermediate features.
Experiments in different settings (i.e., updating, or freezing pretrained
encoders in adaptation, and test-time training that can only access the
unlabeled test data) show that RAda serves as a versatile fine-tuning
technique, improving the baseline with minimal code and performing comparably
against current arts in most settings. Code is available at

Conclusion: 该数据集为改进复杂环境中的异常检测提供了基准，支持离线处理和在线动态标注。

Abstract: After a family murder in rural Germany, authorities failed to locate the
suspect in a vast forest despite a massive search. To aid the search, a
research aircraft captured high-resolution aerial imagery. Due to dense
vegetation obscuring small clues, automated analysis was ineffective, prompting
a crowd-search initiative. This effort produced a unique dataset of labeled,
hard-to-detect anomalies under occluded, real-world conditions. It can serve as
a benchmark for improving anomaly detection approaches in complex forest
environments, supporting manhunts and rescue operations. Initial benchmark
tests showed existing methods performed poorly, highlighting the need for
context-aware approaches. The dataset is openly accessible for offline
processing. An additional interactive web interface supports online viewing and
dynamic growth by allowing users to annotate and submit new findings.

Abstract: Odometry is a critical task for autonomous systems for self-localization and

LiDAR point clouds and images for accurate and robust pose estimation. Our
method utilizes a dense-depth map estimated from point clouds and images
through depth completion, and incorporates a multi-scale feature extraction
network with attention mechanisms, enabling adaptive depth-aware
representations. Furthermore, we leverage dense depth information to refine
flow estimation and mitigate errors in occlusion-prone regions. Our
hierarchical pose refinement module optimizes motion estimation progressively,
ensuring robust predictions against dynamic environments and scale ambiguities.
Comprehensive experiments on the KITTI odometry benchmark demonstrate that our
approach achieves similar or superior accuracy and robustness compared to
state-of-the-art visual and LiDAR odometry methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本-视频检索系统存在文本模糊性、映射不确定性和低质量视频帧等问题，现有方法缺乏对这些不确定性的量化，限制了检索效果。

Method: UMIVR通过语义熵（TAS）、Jensen-Shannon散度（MUS）和时序质量采样器（TQFS）量化不确定性，并生成针对性问题迭代优化查询。

Result: 在MSR-VTT-1k数据集上，UMIVR在10轮交互后Recall@1达到69.2%，显著提升了检索性能。

Conclusion: UMIVR为交互式文本-视频检索提供了一个不确定性最小化的基础框架，显著提升了检索效果。

Abstract: Despite recent advances, Text-to-video retrieval (TVR) is still hindered by
multiple inherent uncertainties, such as ambiguous textual queries, indistinct
text-video mappings, and low-quality video frames. Although interactive systems
have emerged to address these challenges by refining user intent through
clarifying questions, current methods typically rely on heuristic or ad-hoc
strategies without explicitly quantifying these uncertainties, limiting their
effectiveness. Motivated by this gap, we propose UMIVR, an
Uncertainty-Minimizing Interactive Text-to-Video Retrieval framework that
explicitly quantifies three critical uncertainties-text ambiguity, mapping
uncertainty, and frame uncertainty-via principled, training-free metrics:
semantic entropy-based Text Ambiguity Score (TAS), Jensen-Shannon
divergence-based Mapping Uncertainty Score (MUS), and a Temporal Quality-based
Frame Sampler (TQFS). By adaptively generating targeted clarifying questions
guided by these uncertainty measures, UMIVR iteratively refines user queries,
significantly reducing retrieval ambiguity. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmarks validate UMIVR's effectiveness, achieving notable gains in Recall@1
(69.2\% after 10 interactive rounds) on the MSR-VTT-1k dataset, thereby
establishing an uncertainty-minimizing foundation for interactive TVR.

Motivation: 现有Transformer方法在非均匀光照场景（如背光和阴影）中表现不佳，导致过曝或亮度恢复不足。

Method: 提出动态积分图像表示建模空间变化光照，构建SAI²E估计器，并引入光照引导的多头自注意力机制（IG-MSA）。

Result: 在五个标准低光数据集和跨域基准（LOL-Blur）上，SAIGFormer在定量和定性指标上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SAIGFormer在非均匀光照增强中表现优异，并展现出强大的跨数据集泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent Transformer-based low-light enhancement methods have made promising
progress in recovering global illumination. However, they still struggle with
non-uniform lighting scenarios, such as backlit and shadow, appearing as
over-exposure or inadequate brightness restoration. To address this challenge,
we present a Spatially-Adaptive Illumination-Guided Transformer (SAIGFormer)
framework that enables accurate illumination restoration. Specifically, we
propose a dynamic integral image representation to model the spatially-varying
illumination, and further construct a novel Spatially-Adaptive Integral
Illumination Estimator ($\text{SAI}^2\text{E}$). Moreover, we introduce an
Illumination-Guided Multi-head Self-Attention (IG-MSA) mechanism, which
leverages the illumination to calibrate the lightness-relevant features toward
visual-pleased illumination enhancement. Extensive experiments on five standard
low-light datasets and a cross-domain benchmark (LOL-Blur) demonstrate that our
SAIGFormer significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both
quantitative and qualitative metrics. In particular, our method achieves
superior performance in non-uniform illumination enhancement while exhibiting
strong generalization capabilities across multiple datasets. Code is available

TL;DR: GeMix是一种基于生成对抗网络（GAN）的图像增强方法，替代传统的像素级混合，生成更真实的图像，提升分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Mixup方法生成的图像在医学等高风险应用中可能不真实，影响学习效果。

Method: 使用StyleGAN2-ADA生成器，通过标签感知的插值生成图像，结合Beta分布混合标签向量。

Result: 在COVIDx-CT-3数据集上，GeMix提升了所有测试模型的macro-F1，降低了COVID-19检测的假阴性率。

Conclusion: GeMix是一种有效的替代传统Mixup的方法，提供更强的正则化和语义保真度。

Abstract: Mixup has become a popular augmentation strategy for image classification,
yet its naive pixel-wise interpolation often produces unrealistic images that
can hinder learning, particularly in high-stakes medical applications. We
propose GeMix, a two-stage framework that replaces heuristic blending with a
learned, label-aware interpolation powered by class-conditional GANs. First, a
StyleGAN2-ADA generator is trained on the target dataset. During augmentation,
we sample two label vectors from Dirichlet priors biased toward different
classes and blend them via a Beta-distributed coefficient. Then, we condition
the generator on this soft label to synthesize visually coherent images that
lie along a continuous class manifold. We benchmark GeMix on the large-scale
COVIDx-CT-3 dataset using three backbones (ResNet-50, ResNet-101,
EfficientNet-B0). When combined with real data, our method increases macro-F1
over traditional mixup for all backbones, reducing the false negative rate for
COVID-19 detection. GeMix is thus a drop-in replacement for pixel-space mixup,
delivering stronger regularization and greater semantic fidelity, without
disrupting existing training pipelines. We publicly release our code at
https://github.com/hugocarlesso/GeMix to foster reproducibility and further
research.

Result: 在EgoProceL、ProceL和CrossTask基准测试中表现优于OPEL等传统方法。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了自监督程序学习中的关键挑战，性能显著提升。

Abstract: We study the problem of self-supervised procedure learning, which discovers
key steps and establishes their order from a set of unlabeled procedural
videos. Previous procedure learning methods typically learn frame-to-frame
correspondences between videos before determining key steps and their order.
However, their performance often suffers from order variations,
background/redundant frames, and repeated actions. To overcome these
challenges, we propose a self-supervised procedure learning framework, which
utilizes a fused Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport formulation with a
structural prior for computing frame-to-frame mapping between videos. However,
optimizing exclusively for the above temporal alignment term may lead to
degenerate solutions, where all frames are mapped to a small cluster in the
embedding space and hence every video is associated with only one key step. To
address that limitation, we further integrate a contrastive regularization
term, which maps different frames to different points in the embedding space,
avoiding the collapse to trivial solutions. Finally, we conduct extensive
experiments on large-scale egocentric (i.e., EgoProceL) and third-person (i.e.,
ProceL and CrossTask) benchmarks to demonstrate superior performance by our
approach against previous methods, including OPEL which relies on a traditional
Kantorovich optimal transport formulation with an optimality prior.

Motivation: 深度伪造技术对信息完整性和社会信任构成挑战，现有检测方法模型庞大且机制不明确，难以在资源有限环境中部署。

Method: 采用LTH和迭代幅度剪枝方法，在MesoNet、CNN-5和ResNet-18架构上进行实验，分析关键特征和剪枝效果。

Result: 实验显示深度伪造检测网络存在‘中奖票’子网络，即使在高度稀疏下仍保持性能。MesoNet在80%稀疏度下保持56.2%准确率。

Conclusion: LTH方法优于一次性剪枝，且‘中奖票’具有跨数据集可迁移性，为高效可部署的深度伪造检测系统提供了潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in deepfake technology have created increasingly convincing
synthetic media that poses significant challenges to information integrity and
social trust. While current detection methods show promise, their underlying
mechanisms remain poorly understood, and the large sizes of their models make
them challenging to deploy in resource-limited environments. This study
investigates the application of the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) to deepfake
detection, aiming to identify the key features crucial for recognizing
deepfakes. We examine how neural networks can be efficiently pruned while
maintaining high detection accuracy. Through extensive experiments with
MesoNet, CNN-5, and ResNet-18 architectures on the OpenForensic and
FaceForensics++ datasets, we find that deepfake detection networks contain
winning tickets, i.e., subnetworks, that preserve performance even at
substantial sparsity levels. Our results indicate that MesoNet retains 56.2%
accuracy at 80% sparsity on the OpenForensic dataset, with only 3,000
parameters, which is about 90% of its baseline accuracy (62.6%). The results
also show that our proposed LTH-based iterative magnitude pruning approach
consistently outperforms one-shot pruning methods. Using Grad-CAM
visualization, we analyze how pruned networks maintain their focus on critical
facial regions for deepfake detection. Additionally, we demonstrate the
transferability of winning tickets across datasets, suggesting potential for
efficient, deployable deepfake detection systems.

Abstract: Surgical scene understanding is crucial for computer-assisted intervention
systems, requiring visual comprehension of surgical scenes that involves
diverse elements such as surgical tools, anatomical structures, and their
interactions. To effectively represent the complex information in surgical
scenes, graph-based approaches have been explored to structurally model
surgical entities and their relationships. Previous surgical scene graph
studies have demonstrated the feasibility of representing surgical scenes using
graphs. However, certain aspects of surgical scenes-such as diverse
combinations of tool-action-target and the identity of the hand operating the
tool-remain underexplored in graph-based representations, despite their
importance. To incorporate these aspects into graph representations, we propose
Endoscapes-SG201 dataset, which includes annotations for tool-action-target
combinations and hand identity. We also introduce SSG-Com, a graph-based method
designed to learn and represent these critical elements. Through experiments on
downstream tasks such as critical view of safety assessment and action triplet
recognition, we demonstrated the importance of integrating these essential
scene graph components, highlighting their significant contribution to surgical
scene understanding. The code and dataset are available at

Result: 在HICO-DET数据集上，未见动词设置的mAP达到27.91，创下新纪录。

Conclusion: HOLa通过特征分解和权重适应，显著提升了零样本HOI检测的性能。

Abstract: Zero-shot human-object interaction (HOI) detection remains a challenging
task, particularly in generalizing to unseen actions. Existing methods address
this challenge by tapping Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to access knowledge
beyond the training data. However, they either struggle to distinguish actions
involving the same object or demonstrate limited generalization to unseen
classes. In this paper, we introduce HOLa (Zero-Shot HOI Detection with
Low-Rank Decomposed VLM Feature Adaptation), a novel approach that both
enhances generalization to unseen classes and improves action distinction. In
training, HOLa decomposes VLM text features for given HOI classes via low-rank
factorization, producing class-shared basis features and adaptable weights.
These features and weights form a compact HOI representation that preserves
shared information across classes, enhancing generalization to unseen classes.
Subsequently, we refine action distinction by adapting weights for each HOI
class and introducing human-object tokens to enrich visual interaction
representations. To further distinguish unseen actions, we guide the weight
adaptation with LLM-derived action regularization. Experimental results show
that our method sets a new state-of-the-art across zero-shot HOI settings on
HICO-DET, achieving an unseen-class mAP of 27.91 in the unseen-verb setting.

Motivation: 现有AI点云压缩方法依赖特定训练数据分布，限制了实际应用；INR方法虽能解决分布依赖问题，但仅支持有损压缩且编码时间和解码器大小受限。

Method: 设计了点云级编码框架和高效网络初始化策略，减少60%编码时间；提出基于多尺度SparseConv的轻量级编码网络，实现快速推理和小解码器。

Conclusion: LINR-PCGC首次实现基于INR的无损点云几何压缩，显著提升压缩效率和实用性。

Abstract: Existing AI-based point cloud compression methods struggle with dependence on
specific training data distributions, which limits their real-world deployment.
Implicit Neural Representation (INR) methods solve the above problem by
encoding overfitted network parameters to the bitstream, resulting in more
distribution-agnostic results. However, due to the limitation of encoding time
and decoder size, current INR based methods only consider lossy geometry
compression. In this paper, we propose the first INR based lossless point cloud
geometry compression method called Lossless Implicit Neural Representations for
Point Cloud Geometry Compression (LINR-PCGC). To accelerate encoding speed, we
design a group of point clouds level coding framework with an effective network
initialization strategy, which can reduce around 60% encoding time. A
lightweight coding network based on multiscale SparseConv, consisting of scale
context extraction, child node prediction, and model compression modules, is
proposed to realize fast inference and compact decoder size. Experimental
results show that our method consistently outperforms traditional and AI-based
methods: for example, with the convergence time in the MVUB dataset, our method
reduces the bitstream by approximately 21.21% compared to G-PCC TMC13v23 and
21.95% compared to SparsePCGC. Our project can be seen on

Motivation: 传统方法将空间和时间信息分开处理，导致快速移动物体的空间信息难以准确表示，影响了时空交互和视频理解的准确性。

Method: 提出DynImg方法，利用非关键帧作为时间提示，引导模型关注快速移动物体的细粒度空间特征，并采用4D视频旋转位置嵌入保持时空顺序。

Result: 实验表明，DynImg在多个视频理解基准上优于现有方法约2%。

Conclusion: DynImg通过有效整合时空信息，显著提升了视频理解的性能。

Abstract: In recent years, the introduction of Multi-modal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) into video understanding tasks has become increasingly prevalent.
However, how to effectively integrate temporal information remains a critical
research focus. Traditional approaches treat spatial and temporal information
separately. Due to issues like motion blur, it is challenging to accurately
represent the spatial information of rapidly moving objects. This can lead to
temporally important regions being underemphasized during spatial feature
extraction, which in turn hinders accurate spatio-temporal interaction and
video understanding. To address this limitation, we propose an innovative video
representation method called Dynamic-Image (DynImg). Specifically, we introduce
a set of non-key frames as temporal prompts to highlight the spatial areas
containing fast-moving objects. During the process of visual feature
extraction, these prompts guide the model to pay additional attention to the
fine-grained spatial features corresponding to these regions. Moreover, to
maintain the correct sequence for DynImg, we employ a corresponding 4D video
Rotary Position Embedding. This retains both the temporal and spatial adjacency
of DynImg, helping MLLM understand the spatio-temporal order within this
combined format. Experimental evaluations reveal that DynImg surpasses the
state-of-the-art methods by approximately 2% across multiple video
understanding benchmarks, proving the effectiveness of our temporal prompts in
enhancing video comprehension.

Conclusion: 该框架首次实现了卫星上端到端变化检测，为实时应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Change detection from satellite images typically incurs a delay ranging from
several hours up to days because of latency in downlinking the acquired images
and generating orthorectified image products at the ground stations; this may
preclude real- or near real-time applications. To overcome this limitation, we
propose shifting the entire change detection workflow onboard satellites. This
requires to simultaneously solve challenges in data storage, image registration
and change detection with a strict complexity constraint. In this paper, we
present a novel and efficient framework for onboard change detection that
addresses the aforementioned challenges in an end-to-end fashion with a deep
neural network composed of three interlinked submodules: (1) image compression,
tailored to minimize onboard data storage resources; (2) lightweight
co-registration of non-orthorectified multi-temporal image pairs; and (3) a
novel temporally-invariant and computationally efficient change detection
model. This is the first approach in the literature combining all these tasks
in a single end-to-end framework with the constraints dictated by onboard
processing. Experimental results compare each submodule with the current
state-of-the-art, and evaluate the performance of the overall integrated system
in realistic setting on low-power hardware. Compelling change detection results
are obtained in terms of F1 score as a function of compression rate, sustaining
a throughput of 0.7 Mpixel/s on a 15W accelerator.

TL;DR: Being-H0是一个基于大规模人类视频训练的灵巧视觉-语言-动作模型（VLA），通过物理指令调优和新颖的数据处理方法，显著提升了复杂操作任务的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型在复杂操作任务中表现不佳，主要依赖合成数据或有限的遥操作演示，导致泛化能力差。

Method: 提出物理指令调优训练范式，结合大规模VLA预训练、物理空间对齐和机器人任务适应，并引入毫米级精度的部分级运动标记化方法。

Result: Being-H0在手部动作生成和指令跟随方面表现优异，且能有效扩展到实际机器人操作任务。

Conclusion: 通过物理指令调优和大规模数据支持，Being-H0显著提升了复杂操作任务的泛化能力和实际应用效果。

Abstract: We introduce Being-H0, a dexterous Vision-Language-Action model (VLA) trained
on large-scale human videos. Existing VLAs struggle with complex manipulation
tasks requiring high dexterity and generalize poorly to novel scenarios and
tasks, primarily due to their reliance on synthetic data with significant
sim-to-real gaps or teleoperated demonstrations lacking scale and diversity. To
address this data bottleneck, we propose leveraging human hands as a foundation
manipulator, capitalizing on the rich dexterity and scalability present in web
data. Our approach centers on physical instruction tuning, a novel training
paradigm that combines large-scale VLA pretraining from human videos, physical
space alignment for 3D reasoning, and post-training adaptation for robotic
tasks. Additionally, we introduce a part-level motion tokenization method which
achieves millimeter-level reconstruction accuracy to model precise hand
trajectories for action learning. To support our proposed paradigm, we further
develop a comprehensive data curation pipeline that integrates heterogeneous
sources -- including motion capture, VR, and RGB-only videos -- into a
large-scale dataset with millions of motion-based instructional instances. We
empirically show the excellence of Being-H0 in hand motion generation and
instruction following, and it also scales well with model and data sizes.
Importantly, we observe the expected gains of Being-H0 in real-world robotic
manipulation as physical instruction tuning is applied. More details are

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合SDF和3DGS的混合方法，用于稀疏视图的表面重建和新视角渲染，效果优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏视图下的表面重建和新视角渲染存在挑战，SDF方法细节不足，3DGS方法缺乏全局几何一致性。

Method: 结合SDF的粗几何捕捉和3DGS的渲染能力，相互优化细节和全局几何。

Result: 在DTU和MobileBrick数据集上，表面重建和新视角合成效果优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 混合方法有效解决了稀疏视图重建问题，代码将开源。

Abstract: Surface reconstruction and novel view rendering from sparse-view images are
challenging. Signed Distance Function (SDF)-based methods struggle with fine
details, while 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based approaches lack global
geometry coherence. We propose a novel hybrid method that combines the
strengths of both approaches: SDF captures coarse geometry to enhance
3DGS-based rendering, while newly rendered images from 3DGS refine the details
of SDF for accurate surface reconstruction. As a result, our method surpasses
state-of-the-art approaches in surface reconstruction and novel view synthesis
on the DTU and MobileBrick datasets. Code will be released at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于圆柱坐标系的隐式表示方法CylinderPlane，解决了Tri-plane表示中的多视角一致性问题，实现了高质量、无伪影的360°图像合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tri-plane表示在3D感知图像生成中存在对称区域特征共享导致的多面伪影问题，限制了360°视图图像的生成能力。

Method: 提出基于圆柱坐标系的CylinderPlane表示，通过嵌套圆柱结构捕捉多尺度特征，解决了特征模糊问题。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在合成数据集和真实图像上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CylinderPlane提供了一种高效且通用的隐式表示，显著提升了360°图像合成的质量。

Abstract: While the proposal of the Tri-plane representation has advanced the
development of the 3D-aware image generative models, problems rooted in its
inherent structure, such as multi-face artifacts caused by sharing the same
features in symmetric regions, limit its ability to generate 360$^\circ$ view
images. In this paper, we propose CylinderPlane, a novel implicit
representation based on Cylindrical Coordinate System, to eliminate the feature
ambiguity issue and ensure multi-view consistency in 360$^\circ$. Different
from the inevitable feature entanglement in Cartesian coordinate-based
Tri-plane representation, the cylindrical coordinate system explicitly
separates features at different angles, allowing our cylindrical representation
possible to achieve high-quality, artifacts-free 360$^\circ$ image synthesis.
We further introduce the nested cylinder representation that composites
multiple cylinders at different scales, thereby enabling the model more
adaptable to complex geometry and varying resolutions. The combination of
cylinders with different resolutions can effectively capture more critical
locations and multi-scale features, greatly facilitates fine detail learning
and robustness to different resolutions. Moreover, our representation is
agnostic to implicit rendering methods and can be easily integrated into any
neural rendering pipeline. Extensive experiments on both synthetic dataset and
unstructured in-the-wild images demonstrate that our proposed representation
achieves superior performance over previous methods.

Conclusion: ConformalSAM有效利用基础分割模型，解决了标注稀缺问题，提升了半监督语义分割的性能。

Abstract: Pixel-level vision tasks, such as semantic segmentation, require extensive
and high-quality annotated data, which is costly to obtain. Semi-supervised
semantic segmentation (SSSS) has emerged as a solution to alleviate the
labeling burden by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data through
self-training techniques. Meanwhile, the advent of foundational segmentation
models pre-trained on massive data, has shown the potential to generalize
across domains effectively. This work explores whether a foundational
segmentation model can address label scarcity in the pixel-level vision task as
an annotator for unlabeled images. Specifically, we investigate the efficacy of
using SEEM, a Segment Anything Model (SAM) variant fine-tuned for textual
input, to generate predictive masks for unlabeled data. To address the
shortcomings of using SEEM-generated masks as supervision, we propose
ConformalSAM, a novel SSSS framework which first calibrates the foundation
model using the target domain's labeled data and then filters out unreliable
pixel labels of unlabeled data so that only high-confidence labels are used as
supervision. By leveraging conformal prediction (CP) to adapt foundation models
to target data through uncertainty calibration, ConformalSAM exploits the
strong capability of the foundational segmentation model reliably which
benefits the early-stage learning, while a subsequent self-reliance training
strategy mitigates overfitting to SEEM-generated masks in the later training
stage. Our experiment demonstrates that, on three standard benchmarks of SSSS,
ConformalSAM achieves superior performance compared to recent SSSS methods and
helps boost the performance of those methods as a plug-in.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 当前多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在多模态上下文学习（MICL）中过度依赖文本模式，忽视视觉信息。本文提出动态注意力重分配（DARA）和TrueMICL数据集，以提升模型对视觉内容的关注能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在MICL中未能有效利用视觉信息，导致性能受限。本文旨在解决这一问题，提升模型的多模态适应能力。

Method: 提出动态注意力重分配（DARA）策略，调整视觉和文本令牌的注意力权重；并构建TrueMICL数据集，明确要求整合多模态信息。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了模型在多模态上下文学习中的能力。

Conclusion: DARA和TrueMICL为解决MLLMs在MICL中的视觉信息利用问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), built on powerful language
backbones, have enabled Multimodal In-Context Learning (MICL)-adapting to new
tasks from a few multimodal demonstrations consisting of images, questions, and
answers. Despite showing noticeable improvement on standard vision-language
datasets, current MLLMs struggle to leverage visual information in the
demonstrations. Specifically, they tend to neglect visual cues and over-rely on
textual patterns, leading to mere text imitation rather than genuine multimodal
adaptation. This behavior makes MICL still unimodal and largely restricts its
practical utility. More importantly, this limitation is often concealed by the
improved performance on tasks that do not require understanding the visual
context. As a result, how to effectively enhance MICL ability and reliably
evaluate the MICL performance remains underexplored. To address these issues,
we first introduce Dynamic Attention Reallocation (DARA), an efficient
fine-tuning strategy that encourages models to attend to the visual context by
rebalancing attention across visual and textual tokens. In addition, we present
TrueMICL, an MICL-dedicated dataset with both support and test sets that
explicitly requires the integration of multimodal information-particularly
visual content-for correct task completion. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our holistic solution, showcasing substantial improvements
in the true multimodal in-context learning capabilities. Code and datasets are

Result: 实验显示，该方法在少量标注数据下能达到与全监督训练相当的精度，但在特定手稿中AL效果不佳。

Conclusion: 主动学习在特定场景下可能不适用，需探索更适合数据稀缺场景的方法。

Abstract: Optical Music Recognition (OMR) is a cornerstone of music digitization
initiatives in cultural heritage, yet it remains limited by the scarcity of
annotated data and the complexity of historical manuscripts. In this paper, we
present a preliminary study of Active Learning (AL) and Sequential Learning
(SL) tailored for object detection and layout recognition in an old medieval
music manuscript. Leveraging YOLOv8, our system selects samples with the
highest uncertainty (lowest prediction confidence) for iterative labeling and
retraining. Our approach starts with a single annotated image and successfully
boosts performance while minimizing manual labeling. Experimental results
indicate that comparable accuracy to fully supervised training can be achieved
with significantly fewer labeled examples. We test the methodology as a
preliminary investigation on a novel dataset offered to the community by the
Anonymous project, which studies laude, a poetical-musical genre spread across
Italy during the 12th-16th Century. We show that in the manuscript at-hand,
uncertainty-based AL is not effective and advocates for more usable methods in
data-scarcity scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为EVA的训练无关方法，通过动态选择中间层提取视觉事实知识，显著减少多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）中的对象幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs在结合视觉和语言理解方面取得进展，但仍存在对象幻觉问题，即模型生成看似合理但实际错误的输出。研究发现先验知识在深层抑制视觉信息，但中间层的机制尚不明确。

Method: 提出EVA方法，动态选择中间层提取视觉事实知识，通过对比原始输入和纯文本输入的输出分布，修正最终层的输出。

Result: 实验表明，EVA显著降低了幻觉率，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: EVA是一种模型无关、无需训练的方法，能有效缓解MLLMs中的幻觉问题。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant strides by
combining visual recognition and language understanding to generate content
that is both coherent and contextually accurate. However, MLLMs continue to
struggle with object hallucinations, where models produce seemingly plausible
but factually incorrect outputs, including objects that do not exist in the
image. Recent work has revealed that the prior knowledge in MLLMs significantly
suppresses visual information in deep layers, causing hallucinatory outputs.
However, how these priors suppress visual information at the intermediate layer
stage in MLLMs remains unclear. We observe that visual factual knowledge and
the differences between intermediate-layer prior/original probability
distributions show similar evolutionary trends in intermediate layers.
Motivated by this, we introduce Decoding by Extracting Visual Facts (EVA), a
simple, training-free method that dynamically selects intermediate layers with
the most significant visual factual information. By contrasting the output
distributions of the selected layer derived from the original input and
pure-text input, EVA extracts visual factual knowledge and proportionally
incorporates it into the final layer to correct the output logits. Importantly,
EVA is model-agnostic, seamlessly integrates with various classic decoding
strategies, and is applicable across different MLLMs. We validate EVA on
widely-used benchmarks, and the results show that it significantly reduces
hallucination rates compared to baseline methods, underscoring its
effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations.

Motivation: 当前视频对象分割方法依赖外观匹配，缺乏人类对对象的概念理解，导致在视觉变化、遮挡和复杂场景中表现不佳。

Method: SeC利用大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）整合多帧视觉线索，构建对象概念先验，并动态平衡语义推理与特征匹配。

Result: SeC在提出的SeCVOS基准上比SAM 2.1提升了11.8个百分点，实现了概念感知视频对象分割的新SOTA。

Conclusion: SeC通过概念驱动的分割框架，显著提升了复杂场景下的分割性能，为视频对象分割提供了新思路。

Abstract: Video Object Segmentation (VOS) is a core task in computer vision, requiring
models to track and segment target objects across video frames. Despite notable
advances with recent efforts, current techniques still lag behind human
capabilities in handling drastic visual variations, occlusions, and complex
scene changes. This limitation arises from their reliance on appearance
matching, neglecting the human-like conceptual understanding of objects that
enables robust identification across temporal dynamics. Motivated by this gap,
we propose Segment Concept (SeC), a concept-driven segmentation framework that
shifts from conventional feature matching to the progressive construction and
utilization of high-level, object-centric representations. SeC employs Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to integrate visual cues across diverse frames,
constructing robust conceptual priors. During inference, SeC forms a
comprehensive semantic representation of the target based on processed frames,
realizing robust segmentation of follow-up frames. Furthermore, SeC adaptively
balances LVLM-based semantic reasoning with enhanced feature matching,
dynamically adjusting computational efforts based on scene complexity. To
rigorously assess VOS methods in scenarios demanding high-level conceptual
reasoning and robust semantic understanding, we introduce the Semantic Complex
Scenarios Video Object Segmentation benchmark (SeCVOS). SeCVOS comprises 160
manually annotated multi-scenario videos designed to challenge models with
substantial appearance variations and dynamic scene transformations. In
particular, SeC achieves an 11.8-point improvement over SAM 2.1 on SeCVOS,
establishing a new state-of-the-art in concept-aware video object segmentation.

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) is a core task in computer vision. Multimodal
methods based on vision-language models, such as CLIP, have demonstrated
exceptional generalization capabilities in IQA tasks. To address the issues of
excessive parameter burden and insufficient ability to identify local distorted

were designed to guide CLIP to output quality scores. Then, CLIP is fine-tuned
to enhance its capabilities in IQA tasks. Finally, a modality-adaptive
knowledge distillation strategy is proposed to achieve guidance from the CLIP
teacher model to the student model. Our experiments were conducted on multiple

reduces model complexity while outperforming existing IQA methods,
demonstrating strong potential for practical deployment.

Conclusion: Hi²-GSLoc为遥感应用提供了一种高效且准确的视觉重定位解决方案。

Abstract: Visual relocalization, which estimates the 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) camera
pose from query images, is fundamental to remote sensing and UAV applications.
Existing methods face inherent trade-offs: image-based retrieval and pose
regression approaches lack precision, while structure-based methods that
register queries to Structure-from-Motion (SfM) models suffer from
computational complexity and limited scalability. These challenges are
particularly pronounced in remote sensing scenarios due to large-scale scenes,
high altitude variations, and domain gaps of existing visual priors. To
overcome these limitations, we leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as a novel
scene representation that compactly encodes both 3D geometry and appearance. We
introduce $\mathrm{Hi}^2$-GSLoc, a dual-hierarchical relocalization framework
that follows a sparse-to-dense and coarse-to-fine paradigm, fully exploiting
the rich semantic information and geometric constraints inherent in Gaussian
primitives. To handle large-scale remote sensing scenarios, we incorporate
partitioned Gaussian training, GPU-accelerated parallel matching, and dynamic
memory management strategies. Our approach consists of two stages: (1) a sparse
stage featuring a Gaussian-specific consistent render-aware sampling strategy
and landmark-guided detector for robust and accurate initial pose estimation,
and (2) a dense stage that iteratively refines poses through coarse-to-fine
dense rasterization matching while incorporating reliability verification.
Through comprehensive evaluation on simulation data, public datasets, and real
flight experiments, we demonstrate that our method delivers competitive
localization accuracy, recall rate, and computational efficiency while
effectively filtering unreliable pose estimates. The results confirm the
effectiveness of our approach for practical remote sensing applications.

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏视图3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）在重建高质量新视图时容易过拟合高频细节，现有基于傅里叶变换的频率正则化方法参数调优困难且偏向有害高频学习。

Method: DWTGS利用小波空间损失提供额外的空间监督，仅监督多级小波变换中的低频LL子带，并以自监督方式对高频HH子带施加稀疏性。

Result: 实验表明，DWTGS在多个基准测试中优于基于傅里叶的方法，低频中心策略提高了泛化能力并减少了高频幻觉。

Conclusion: DWTGS通过小波变换重新思考频率正则化，为稀疏视图3DGS提供了一种更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Sparse-view 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) presents significant challenges in
reconstructing high-quality novel views, as it often overfits to the
widely-varying high-frequency (HF) details of the sparse training views. While
frequency regularization can be a promising approach, its typical reliance on
Fourier transforms causes difficult parameter tuning and biases towards
detrimental HF learning. We propose DWTGS, a framework that rethinks frequency
regularization by leveraging wavelet-space losses that provide additional
spatial supervision. Specifically, we supervise only the low-frequency (LF) LL
subbands at multiple DWT levels, while enforcing sparsity on the HF HH subband
in a self-supervised manner. Experiments across benchmarks show that DWTGS
consistently outperforms Fourier-based counterparts, as this LF-centric
strategy improves generalization and reduces HF hallucinations.

Abstract: Face image quality assessment (FIQA) is essential for various face-related
applications. Although FIQA has been extensively studied and achieved
significant progress, the computational complexity of FIQA algorithms remains a
key concern for ensuring scalability and practical deployment in real-world
systems. In this paper, we aim to develop a computationally efficient FIQA
method that can be easily deployed in real-world applications. Specifically,
our method consists of two stages: training a powerful teacher model and
distilling a lightweight student model from it. To build a strong teacher
model, we adopt a self-training strategy to improve its capacity. We first
train the teacher model using labeled face images, then use it to generate
pseudo-labels for a set of unlabeled images. These pseudo-labeled samples are
used in two ways: (1) to distill knowledge into the student model, and (2) to
combine with the original labeled images to further enhance the teacher model
through self-training. The enhanced teacher model is used to further
pseudo-label another set of unlabeled images for distilling the student models.
The student model is trained using a combination of labeled images,
pseudo-labeled images from the original teacher model, and pseudo-labeled
images from the enhanced teacher model. Experimental results demonstrate that
our student model achieves comparable performance to the teacher model with an
extremely low computational overhead. Moreover, our method achieved first place
in the ICCV 2025 VQualA FIQA Challenge. The code is available at

Abstract: Enabling image generation models to be spatially controlled is an important
area of research, empowering users to better generate images according to their
own fine-grained specifications via e.g. edge maps, poses. Although this task
has seen impressive improvements in recent times, a focus on rapidly producing
stronger models has come at the cost of detailed and fair scientific
comparison. Differing training data, model architectures and generation
paradigms make it difficult to disentangle the factors contributing to
performance. Meanwhile, the motivations and nuances of certain approaches
become lost in the literature. In this work, we aim to provide clear takeaways
across generation paradigms for practitioners wishing to develop
transformer-based systems for spatially-controlled generation, clarifying the
literature and addressing knowledge gaps. We perform controlled experiments on
ImageNet across diffusion-based/flow-based and autoregressive (AR) models.
First, we establish control token prefilling as a simple, general and
performant baseline approach for transformers. We then investigate previously
underexplored sampling time enhancements, showing that extending
classifier-free guidance to control, as well as softmax truncation, have a
strong impact on control-generation consistency. Finally, we re-clarify the
motivation of adapter-based approaches, demonstrating that they mitigate
"forgetting" and maintain generation quality when trained on limited downstream
data, but underperform full training in terms of generation-control
consistency. Code will be released upon publication.

TL;DR: TokensGen提出了一种两阶段框架，通过压缩令牌解决长视频生成中的内存和一致性挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在生成短视频时表现优异，但扩展到长视频时面临内存瓶颈和长期不一致性问题。

Method: 方法包括训练To2V模型生成短视频令牌，引入T2To模型确保全局一致性，并使用FIFO-Diffusion策略平滑过渡。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了长视频的时序和内容一致性，计算开销可控。

Conclusion: TokensGen为长视频生成提供了可扩展的模块化解决方案，适用于影视制作和沉浸式模拟。

Abstract: Generating consistent long videos is a complex challenge: while
diffusion-based generative models generate visually impressive short clips,
extending them to longer durations often leads to memory bottlenecks and
long-term inconsistency. In this paper, we propose TokensGen, a novel two-stage
framework that leverages condensed tokens to address these issues. Our method
decomposes long video generation into three core tasks: (1) inner-clip semantic
control, (2) long-term consistency control, and (3) inter-clip smooth
transition. First, we train To2V (Token-to-Video), a short video diffusion
model guided by text and video tokens, with a Video Tokenizer that condenses
short clips into semantically rich tokens. Second, we introduce T2To
(Text-to-Token), a video token diffusion transformer that generates all tokens
at once, ensuring global consistency across clips. Finally, during inference,
an adaptive FIFO-Diffusion strategy seamlessly connects adjacent clips,
reducing boundary artifacts and enhancing smooth transitions. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances long-term temporal
and content coherence without incurring prohibitive computational overhead. By
leveraging condensed tokens and pre-trained short video models, our method
provides a scalable, modular solution for long video generation, opening new
possibilities for storytelling, cinematic production, and immersive
simulations. Please see our project page at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer的方法，通过预测空间自适应的双边网格来校正多视角一致性中的光度变化，无需场景特定重训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代相机处理流程导致多视角间光度不一致，影响新视角合成的质量。

Method: 使用Transformer预测双边网格，校正光度变化，并将其集成到3D高斯泼溅流程中。

Result: 在重建质量和收敛速度上优于或匹配现有场景特定优化方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在多视角一致性和训练效率上表现优异，具有跨场景泛化能力。

Abstract: Modern camera pipelines apply extensive on-device processing, such as
exposure adjustment, white balance, and color correction, which, while
beneficial individually, often introduce photometric inconsistencies across
views. These appearance variations violate multi-view consistency and degrade
the quality of novel view synthesis. Joint optimization of scene
representations and per-image appearance embeddings has been proposed to
address this issue, but at the cost of increased computational complexity and
slower training. In this work, we propose a transformer-based method that
predicts spatially adaptive bilateral grids to correct photometric variations
in a multi-view consistent manner, enabling robust cross-scene generalization
without the need for scene-specific retraining. By incorporating the learned
grids into the 3D Gaussian Splatting pipeline, we improve reconstruction
quality while maintaining high training efficiency. Extensive experiments show
that our approach outperforms or matches existing scene-specific optimization
methods in reconstruction fidelity and convergence speed.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为HDF的新框架，通过两个模块增强时间-频率建模并优化样本不平衡问题，显著提升了动态面部表情识别的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在多源数据和个体表达差异导致的样本异质性下性能下降的问题。

Method: 设计了Time-Frequency Distributional Attention Module (DAM)和Distribution-aware Scaling Module (DSM)，分别用于时间-频率建模和动态平衡分类与对比损失。

Result: 在DFEW和FERV39k数据集上，HDF显著提升了识别准确性和鲁棒性，取得了更高的WAR和UAR。

Conclusion: HDF框架在动态面部表情识别中表现出色，具有强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER) plays a critical role in
affective computing and human-computer interaction. Although existing methods
achieve comparable performance, they inevitably suffer from performance
degradation under sample heterogeneity caused by multi-source data and
individual expression variability. To address these challenges, we propose a
novel framework, called Heterogeneity-aware Distributional Framework (HDF), and
design two plug-and-play modules to enhance time-frequency modeling and
mitigate optimization imbalance caused by hard samples. Specifically, the
Time-Frequency Distributional Attention Module (DAM) captures both temporal
consistency and frequency robustness through a dual-branch attention design,
improving tolerance to sequence inconsistency and visual style shifts. Then,
based on gradient sensitivity and information bottleneck principles, an
adaptive optimization module Distribution-aware Scaling Module (DSM) is
introduced to dynamically balance classification and contrastive losses,
enabling more stable and discriminative representation learning. Extensive
experiments on two widely used datasets, DFEW and FERV39k, demonstrate that HDF
significantly improves both recognition accuracy and robustness. Our method
achieves superior weighted average recall (WAR) and unweighted average recall
(UAR) while maintaining strong generalization across diverse and imbalanced
scenarios. Codes are released at https://github.com/QIcita/HDF_DFER.

TL;DR: 提出两种基于树结构的语义损失函数，利用标签的层次结构改进医学图像分割性能。


<details>

Motivation: 现有医学图像分割方法对所有错误同等惩罚，未能利用标签空间的语义信息，尤其在标签复杂时表现不佳。

Method: 提出两种树状语义损失函数，并结合稀疏标注训练方法。

Result: 在头部MRI全脑分割和神经外科高光谱图像场景理解任务中达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 树状语义损失函数能有效提升复杂标签场景下的分割性能。

Abstract: Rich and accurate medical image segmentation is poised to underpin the next
generation of AI-defined clinical practice by delineating critical anatomy for
pre-operative planning, guiding real-time intra-operative navigation, and
supporting precise post-operative assessment. However, commonly used learning
methods for medical and surgical imaging segmentation tasks penalise all errors
equivalently and thus fail to exploit any inter-class semantics in the labels
space. This becomes particularly problematic as the cardinality and richness of
labels increases to include subtly different classes. In this work, we propose
two tree-based semantic loss functions which take advantage of a hierarchical
organisation of the labels. We further incorporate our losses in a recently
proposed approach for training with sparse, background-free annotations to
extend the applicability of our proposed losses. Extensive experiments are
reported on two medical and surgical image segmentation tasks, namely head MRI
for whole brain parcellation (WBP) with full supervision and neurosurgical
hyperspectral imaging (HSI) for scene understanding with sparse annotations.
Results demonstrate that our proposed method reaches state-of-the-art
performance in both cases.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态调整低秩适应（LoRA）方法，用于医学图像分割，通过引入稀疏正则化自动确定任务适应的秩，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LoRA方法需要固定秩，难以适应医学图像任务的复杂性，因此提出动态调整秩的方法以提高效率和性能。

Method: 通过奇异值分解和引入l_1稀疏正则化到损失函数中，使用近端优化器动态调整秩。

Result: 在少样本微调实验中，该方法显著优于标准LoRA和其他PEFT方法，表现出高效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 动态调整秩的方法在医学图像分割中具有显著优势，代码已开源。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of pre-trained foundation models is
increasingly attracting interest in medical imaging due to its effectiveness
and computational efficiency. Among these methods, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
is a notable approach based on the assumption that the adaptation inherently
occurs in a low-dimensional subspace. While it has shown good performance, its
implementation requires a fixed and unalterable rank, which might be
challenging to select given the unique complexities and requirements of each
medical imaging downstream task. Inspired by advancements in natural image
processing, we introduce a novel approach for medical image segmentation that
dynamically adjusts the intrinsic rank during adaptation. Viewing the low-rank
representation of the trainable weight matrices as a singular value
decomposition, we introduce an l_1 sparsity regularizer to the loss function,
and tackle it with a proximal optimizer. The regularizer could be viewed as a
penalty on the decomposition rank. Hence, its minimization enables to find
task-adapted ranks automatically. Our method is evaluated in a realistic
few-shot fine-tuning setting, where we compare it first to the standard LoRA
and then to several other PEFT methods across two distinguishable tasks: base
organs and novel organs. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the significant
performance improvements driven by our method, highlighting its efficiency and
robustness against suboptimal rank initialization. Our code is publicly

Abstract: The paper investigates the performance of state-of-the-art low-parameter deep
neural networks for computer vision, focusing on bottleneck architectures and
their behavior using superlinear activation functions. We address interference
in feature maps, a phenomenon associated with superposition, where neurons
simultaneously encode multiple characteristics. Our research suggests that
limiting interference can enhance scaling and accuracy in very low-scaled
networks (under 1.5M parameters). We identify key design elements that reduce
interference by examining various bottleneck architectures, leading to a more
efficient neural network. Consequently, we propose a proof-of-concept
architecture named NoDepth Bottleneck built on mechanistic insights from our
experiments, demonstrating robust scaling accuracy on the ImageNet dataset.
These findings contribute to more efficient and scalable neural networks for
the low-parameter range and advance the understanding of bottlenecks in
computer vision. https://caiac.pubpub.org/pub/3dh6rsel

Conclusion: 扩散模型在多变量地下建模和反演中具有高效性和灵活性，适用于硬数据和间接数据的联合建模。

Abstract: Diffusion models offer stable training and state-of-the-art performance for
deep generative modeling tasks. Here, we consider their use in the context of
multivariate subsurface modeling and probabilistic inversion. We first
demonstrate that diffusion models enhance multivariate modeling capabilities
compared to variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks. In
diffusion modeling, the generative process involves a comparatively large
number of time steps with update rules that can be modified to account for
conditioning data. We propose different corrections to the popular Diffusion
Posterior Sampling approach by Chung et al. (2023). In particular, we introduce
a likelihood approximation accounting for the noise-contamination that is
inherent in diffusion modeling. We assess performance in a multivariate
geological scenario involving facies and correlated acoustic impedance.
Conditional modeling is demonstrated using both local hard data (well logs) and
nonlinear geophysics (fullstack seismic data). Our tests show significantly
improved statistical robustness, enhanced sampling of the posterior probability
density function and reduced computational costs, compared to the original
approach. The method can be used with both hard and indirect conditioning data,
individually or simultaneously. As the inversion is included within the
diffusion process, it is faster than other methods requiring an outer-loop
around the generative model, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo.

Motivation: 当前文本到视频生成模型在物理常识方面表现不足，常违反因果关系和对象行为等直觉期望。

Method: 提出PhysVidBench基准，包含383个提示，采用三阶段评估流程：生成物理问题、视频字幕生成、语言模型回答问题。

Result: 通过间接评估策略，避免了直接视频评估中的幻觉问题，为生成视频模型的物理常识评估提供了结构化框架。

Conclusion: PhysVidBench填补了当前文本到视频评估中的物理常识空白，为模型改进提供了明确方向。

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-video (T2V) generation has enabled the synthesis
of visually compelling and temporally coherent videos from natural language.
However, these models often fall short in basic physical commonsense, producing
outputs that violate intuitive expectations around causality, object behavior,
and tool use. Addressing this gap, we present PhysVidBench, a benchmark
designed to evaluate the physical reasoning capabilities of T2V systems. The
benchmark includes 383 carefully curated prompts, emphasizing tool use,
material properties, and procedural interactions, and domains where physical
plausibility is crucial. For each prompt, we generate videos using diverse
state-of-the-art models and adopt a three-stage evaluation pipeline: (1)
formulate grounded physics questions from the prompt, (2) caption the generated
video with a vision-language model, and (3) task a language model to answer
several physics-involved questions using only the caption. This indirect
strategy circumvents common hallucination issues in direct video-based
evaluation. By highlighting affordances and tool-mediated actions, areas
overlooked in current T2V evaluations, PhysVidBench provides a structured,
interpretable framework for assessing physical commonsense in generative video
models.

Motivation: 现代生成模型共享类似的训练目标（去噪），但视觉分词器的有效属性尚不明确。

Method: 提出Latent Denoising Tokenizer (l-DeTok)，通过重构受噪声和掩码污染的潜在嵌入来训练分词器。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256上，l-DeTok在六种代表性生成模型中表现优于标准分词器。

Conclusion: 去噪应作为分词器设计的基本原则，为未来分词器设计提供新视角。

Abstract: Despite their fundamental role, it remains unclear what properties could make
visual tokenizers more effective for generative modeling. We observe that
modern generative models share a conceptually similar training objective --
reconstructing clean signals from corrupted inputs such as Gaussian noise or
masking -- a process we term denoising. Motivated by this insight, we propose
aligning tokenizer embeddings directly with the downstream denoising objective,
encouraging latent embeddings to be more easily reconstructed even when heavily
corrupted. To achieve this, we introduce the Latent Denoising Tokenizer
(l-DeTok), a simple yet effective tokenizer trained to reconstruct clean images
from latent embeddings corrupted by interpolative noise and random masking.
Extensive experiments on ImageNet 256x256 demonstrate that our tokenizer
consistently outperforms standard tokenizers across six representative
generative models. Our findings highlight denoising as a fundamental design
principle for tokenizer development, and we hope it could motivate new
perspectives for future tokenizer design.

Conclusion: DeepWriter通过结构化知识库和多模态检索，显著提升了专业领域写作的质量和可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
various applications. However, their use as writing assistants in specialized
domains like finance, medicine, and law is often hampered by a lack of deep
domain-specific knowledge and a tendency to hallucinate. Existing solutions,
such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), can suffer from inconsistency
across multiple retrieval steps, while online search-based methods often
degrade quality due to unreliable web content. To address these challenges, we
introduce DeepWriter, a customizable, multimodal, long-form writing assistant
that operates on a curated, offline knowledge base. DeepWriter leverages a
novel pipeline that involves task decomposition, outline generation, multimodal
retrieval, and section-by-section composition with reflection. By deeply mining
information from a structured corpus and incorporating both textual and visual
elements, DeepWriter generates coherent, factually grounded, and
professional-grade documents. We also propose a hierarchical knowledge
representation to enhance retrieval efficiency and accuracy. Our experiments on
financial report generation demonstrate that DeepWriter produces high-quality,
verifiable articles that surpasses existing baselines in factual accuracy and
generated content quality.

Result: 编辑后的知识在微调中更易遗忘，冻结相关层能显著改善知识保留。

Conclusion: 当前编辑方法在微调中存在局限性，未来需评估编辑的鲁棒性并优化层冻结策略。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) store vast amounts of knowledge, which often
requires updates to correct factual errors, incorporate newly acquired
information, or adapt model behavior. Model editing methods have emerged as
efficient solutions for such updates, offering localized and precise knowledge
modification at significantly lower computational cost than continual training.
In parallel, LLMs are frequently fine-tuned for a wide range of downstream
tasks. However, the effect of fine-tuning on previously edited knowledge
remains poorly understood. In this work, we systematically investigate how
different fine-tuning objectives interact with various model editing
techniques. Our findings show that edited knowledge is substantially more
susceptible to forgetting during fine-tuning than intrinsic knowledge acquired
through pre-training. This analysis highlights a key limitation of current
editing approaches and suggests that evaluating edit robustness under
downstream fine-tuning is critical for their practical deployment. We further
find that freezing layers associated with edited content can significantly
improve knowledge retention, offering insight into how future editing methods
might be made more robust.

Conclusion: SMACS证明了开源LLMs协作的潜力，推动了智能上限。

Abstract: This paper aims to demonstrate the potential and strengths of open-source
collectives. It leads to a promising question: Can we harness multiple
open-source LLMs to match or even beat the closed-source LLMs? To answer this,
we propose SMACS, a scalable multi-agent collaboration system (MACS) framework
with high performance. Specifically, for continuous integration of new LLMs and
generalization to diverse questions, we first propose a Retrieval-based Prior
Selection (RPS), which assigns a proxy performance score to each LLM to select
the Top-k LLMs at the instance level for any given question. Then, we propose
an Exploration-Exploitation-Driven Posterior Enhancement (EPE), encouraging the
generation of diverse responses through prior dropping and selecting the
high-quality response via a hybrid posterior score. Experiments on eight
mainstream benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our SMACS: by integrating
fifteen open-source LLMs, SMACS outperforms leading closed-source LLMs in 2025,
e.g., Claude-3.7-Sonnet (+12.73%), GPT-4.1(+5.36%) and GPT-o3-mini(+5.28%)
across multiple tasks. Remarkably, it even exceeds the average of best results
of different datasets from both open-source LLMs (+2.86%) and closed-source

Motivation: 现代用户很少阅读隐私政策，但希望保护个人数据。PoliAnalyzer旨在自动化分析隐私政策，帮助用户快速识别与偏好冲突的部分。

Method: 结合NLP提取政策文本的正式表示，通过逻辑推理比较用户偏好与政策内容，生成合规报告。扩展了现有数据使用政策语言。

Result: 在PolicyIE数据集上，PoliAnalyzer的F1-score达90-100%。分析显示95.2%的政策内容与用户偏好无冲突，仅4.8%需关注。

Conclusion: PoliAnalyzer能规模化支持个性化隐私政策分析，帮助用户重新掌控数据，并促进社会对平台数据实践的讨论。

Abstract: In modern times, people have numerous online accounts, but they rarely read
the Terms of Service or Privacy Policy of those sites despite claiming
otherwise. This paper introduces PoliAnalyzer, a neuro-symbolic system that
assists users with personalized privacy policy analysis. PoliAnalyzer uses
Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract formal representations of data
usage practices from policy texts. In favor of deterministic, logical inference
is applied to compare user preferences with the formal privacy policy
representation and produce a compliance report. To achieve this, we extend an
existing formal Data Terms of Use policy language to model privacy policies as
app policies and user preferences as data policies. In our evaluation using our
enriched PolicyIE dataset curated by legal experts, PoliAnalyzer demonstrated
high accuracy in identifying relevant data usage practices, achieving F1-score
of 90-100% across most tasks. Additionally, we demonstrate how PoliAnalyzer can
model diverse user data-sharing preferences, derived from prior research as 23
user profiles, and perform compliance analysis against the top 100 most-visited
websites. This analysis revealed that, on average, 95.2% of a privacy policy's
segments do not conflict with the analyzed user preferences, enabling users to
concentrate on understanding the 4.8% (636 / 13205) that violates preferences,
significantly reducing cognitive burden. Further, we identified common
practices in privacy policies that violate user expectations - such as the
sharing of location data with 3rd parties. This paper demonstrates that
PoliAnalyzer can support automated personalized privacy policy analysis at
scale using off-the-shelf NLP tools. This sheds light on a pathway to help
individuals regain control over their data and encourage societal discussions
on platform data practices to promote a fairer power dynamic.

Conclusion: 上下文语言建模对双相情感障碍检测至关重要，研究为心理健康NLP应用提供了模型选择依据。

Abstract: Bipolar disorder is a chronic mental illness frequently underdiagnosed due to
subtle early symptoms and social stigma. This paper explores the advanced
natural language processing (NLP) models for recognizing signs of bipolar
disorder based on user-generated social media text. We conduct a comprehensive
evaluation of transformer-based models (BERT, RoBERTa, ALBERT, ELECTRA,
DistilBERT) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models based on contextualized
(BERT) and static (GloVe, Word2Vec) word embeddings. Experiments were performed
on a large, annotated dataset of Reddit posts after confirming their validity
through sentiment variance and judgmental analysis. Our results demonstrate
that RoBERTa achieves the highest performance among transformer models with an
F1 score of ~98% while LSTM models using BERT embeddings yield nearly identical
results. In contrast, LSTMs trained on static embeddings fail to capture
meaningful patterns, scoring near-zero F1. These findings underscore the
critical role of contextual language modeling in detecting bipolar disorder. In
addition, we report model training times and highlight that DistilBERT offers
an optimal balance between efficiency and accuracy. In general, our study
offers actionable insights for model selection in mental health NLP
applications and validates the potential of contextualized language models to
support early bipolar disorder screening.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型（LLM）在用户应用中会根据身份标记（如种族、性别、年龄）产生偏见，可能导致医疗、薪资和政治事实的不公平差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM如何利用用户文本中的身份信息进行决策，及其在高风险应用中的潜在危害。

Method: 对五个高风险领域的LLM应用（医疗、法律、政治、政府福利、薪资）进行全面分析，评估身份标记对模型决策的影响。

Result: LLM对身份标记极其敏感，导致医疗标准、薪资建议和政治观点因种族、性别和年龄而异。

Conclusion: 现成的LLM应用可能引发不公平后果，建议在部署前进行全面评估，并提供新工具检测身份标记的影响。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used in user-facing
applications, from providing medical consultations to job interview advice.
Recent research suggests that these models are becoming increasingly proficient
at inferring identity information about the author of a piece of text from
linguistic patterns as subtle as the choice of a few words. However, little is
known about how LLMs use this information in their decision-making in
real-world applications. We perform the first comprehensive analysis of how
identity markers present in a user's writing bias LLM responses across five
different high-stakes LLM applications in the domains of medicine, law,
politics, government benefits, and job salaries. We find that LLMs are
extremely sensitive to markers of identity in user queries and that race,
gender, and age consistently influence LLM responses in these applications. For
instance, when providing medical advice, we find that models apply different
standards of care to individuals of different ethnicities for the same
symptoms; we find that LLMs are more likely to alter answers to align with a
conservative (liberal) political worldview when asked factual questions by
older (younger) individuals; and that LLMs recommend lower salaries for
non-White job applicants and higher salaries for women compared to men. Taken
together, these biases mean that the use of off-the-shelf LLMs for these
applications may cause harmful differences in medical care, foster wage gaps,
and create different political factual realities for people of different
identities. Beyond providing an analysis, we also provide new tools for
evaluating how subtle encoding of identity in users' language choices impacts
model decisions. Given the serious implications of these findings, we recommend
that similar thorough assessments of LLM use in user-facing applications are
conducted before future deployment.

TL;DR: 论文提出CCL-XCoT框架，通过两阶段微调减少多语言大模型在低资源语言中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言大模型在低资源语言中易产生幻觉，影响生成任务的准确性。

Method: 采用课程对比学习和跨语言思维链提示策略，分两阶段微调模型。

Result: 实验显示CCL-XCoT将幻觉率降低62%，并显著提升跨语言知识迁移。

Conclusion: CCL-XCoT有效减少幻觉，无需外部检索或多模型集成。

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models(MLLMs) demonstrate strong generalization
across languages, yet they remain prone to hallucinations, especially in
low-resource languages, due to training data imbalances. These hallucinations,
which include inaccurate or fabricated outputs, are particularly problematic in
domain-specific generation tasks (Chataigner et al., 2024). To address this
challenge, we propose CCL-XCoT(Curriculum-based Contrastive Learning-based
Cross-lingual Chain-of-Thought), a two-stage fine-tuning framework for
mitigating hallucination in MLLMs. Our approach first enhances cross-lingual
semantic alignment through curriculum-based contrastive learning combined with
next-token prediction during continued pre-training. Building on this
foundation, we then introduce a cross-lingual Chain-of-Thought (XCoT) prompting
strategy during instruction fine-tuning, which guides the model to reason in a
high-resource language before generating answers in the target low-resource
language. Experimental results show that CCL-XCoT reduces hallucination rates
by up to 62% and substantially improves factual knowledge transfer across
language pairs, without relying on external retrieval or multi-model ensembles.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) leverage deep learning to process and predict
sequences of words from context, enabling them to perform various NLP tasks,
such as translation, summarization, question answering, and content generation.
However, the growing size and complexity of developing, training, and deploying
advanced LLMs require extensive computational resources and large datasets.
This creates a barrier for users. As a result, platforms that host models and
datasets are widely used. For example, Hugging Face, one of the most popular
platforms, hosted 1.8 million models and 450K datasets by June 2025, with no
sign of slowing down. Since many LLMs are built from base models, pre-trained
models, and external datasets, they can inherit vulnerabilities, biases, or
malicious components from earlier models or datasets. Therefore, it is critical
to understand the origin and development of these components to better detect
potential risks, improve model fairness, and ensure compliance. Motivated by
this, our project aims to study the relationships between models and datasets,
which are core components of the LLM supply chain. First, we design a method to
systematically collect LLM supply chain data. Using this data, we build a
directed heterogeneous graph to model the relationships between models and
datasets, resulting in a structure with 397,376 nodes and 453,469 edges. We
then perform various analyses and uncover several findings, such as: (i) the
LLM supply chain graph is large, sparse, and follows a power-law degree
distribution; (ii) it features a densely connected core and a fragmented
periphery; (iii) datasets play pivotal roles in training; (iv) strong
interdependence exists between models and datasets; and (v) the graph is
dynamic, with daily updates reflecting the ecosystem's ongoing evolution.

Abstract: Recent methods for customizing Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) for
domain-specific tasks have shown promising results in scientific chart
comprehension. However, existing approaches face two major limitations: First,
they rely on paired data from only a few chart types, limiting generalization
to wide range of chart types. Secondly, they lack targeted pre-training for
chart-data alignment, which hampers the model's understanding of underlying
data. In this paper, we introduce ChartScope, an LVLM optimized for in-depth
chart comprehension across diverse chart types. We propose an efficient data
generation pipeline that synthesizes paired data for a wide range of chart
types, along with a novel Dual-Path training strategy that enabling the model
to succinctly capture essential data details while preserving robust reasoning
capabilities by incorporating reasoning over the underlying data. Lastly, we
establish ChartDQA, a new benchmark for evaluating not only question-answering
at different levels but also underlying data understanding. Experimental
results demonstrate that ChartScope significantly enhances comprehension on a
wide range of chart types. The code and data are available at

Motivation: 多语言大模型在低资源语言中表现不佳，而高质量对齐数据稀缺，翻译现有英语数据时难以保留非文本内容（如代码、数学表达式）。

Method: 提出LLM选择性翻译技术，仅翻译可翻译部分，保留非翻译内容（如代码、JSON）和句子结构，并与传统翻译（如GCP）和混合数据对齐进行比较。

Result: 实验表明，选择性翻译在印地语中优于传统翻译方法，且混合翻译样本与原始英语数据对齐效果更佳。

Conclusion: 选择性翻译是改善多语言模型对齐的实用有效方法，尤其适用于低资源语言。

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) often demonstrate a performance gap
between English and non-English languages, particularly in low-resource
settings. Aligning these models to low-resource languages is essential yet
challenging due to limited high-quality data. While English alignment datasets
are readily available, curating equivalent data in other languages is expensive
and time-consuming. A common workaround is to translate existing English
alignment data; however, standard translation techniques often fail to preserve
critical elements such as code, mathematical expressions, and structured
formats like JSON. In this work, we investigate LLM-based selective
translation, a technique that selectively translates only the translatable
parts of a text while preserving non-translatable content and sentence
structure. We conduct a systematic study to explore key questions around this
approach, including its effectiveness compared to vanilla translation, the
importance of filtering noisy outputs, and the benefits of mixing translated
samples with original English data during alignment. Our experiments focus on
the low-resource Indic language Hindi and compare translations generated by
Google Cloud Translation (GCP) and Llama-3.1-405B. The results highlight the
promise of selective translation as a practical and effective method for
improving multilingual alignment in LLMs.

Result: LLMs依赖典型性、判断不一致且因果推理能力不足，叙事理解不完整。

Conclusion: LLMs处理时间意义的方式与人类不同，缺乏稳健的叙事理解能力，并提出了标准化评估框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit increasingly sophisticated linguistic
capabilities, yet the extent to which these behaviors reflect human-like
cognition versus advanced pattern recognition remains an open question. In this
study, we investigate how LLMs process the temporal meaning of linguistic
aspect in narratives that were previously used in human studies. Using an
Expert-in-the-Loop probing pipeline, we conduct a series of targeted
experiments to assess whether LLMs construct semantic representations and
pragmatic inferences in a human-like manner. Our findings show that LLMs
over-rely on prototypicality, produce inconsistent aspectual judgments, and
struggle with causal reasoning derived from aspect, raising concerns about
their ability to fully comprehend narratives. These results suggest that LLMs
process aspect fundamentally differently from humans and lack robust narrative
understanding. Beyond these empirical findings, we develop a standardized
experimental framework for the reliable assessment of LLMs' cognitive and
linguistic capabilities.

Motivation: 在线新闻依赖广告收入，导致标题常为点击诱饵，影响信息质量和读者信任，需自动检测方法。

Method: 构建CLIC数据集，微调BERTi\'c模型，并与基于LLM的上下文学习方法（克罗地亚语和英语提示）对比。

Result: 近半数标题含点击诱饵，微调模型优于通用LLM。

Conclusion: 微调模型在点击诱饵检测中表现更佳，尤其在资源较少的语言中。

Abstract: Online news outlets operate predominantly on an advertising-based revenue
model, compelling journalists to create headlines that are often scandalous,
intriguing, and provocative -- commonly referred to as clickbait. Automatic
detection of clickbait headlines is essential for preserving information
quality and reader trust in digital media and requires both contextual
understanding and world knowledge. For this task, particularly in
less-resourced languages, it remains unclear whether fine-tuned methods or
in-context learning (ICL) yield better results. In this paper, we compile CLIC,
a novel dataset for clickbait detection of Croatian news headlines spanning a
20-year period and encompassing mainstream and fringe outlets. We fine-tune the
BERTi\'c model on this task and compare its performance to LLM-based ICL
methods with prompts both in Croatian and English. Finally, we analyze the
linguistic properties of clickbait. We find that nearly half of the analyzed
headlines contain clickbait, and that finetuned models deliver better results
than general LLMs.

Motivation: 探索LLM在人格评估中的潜力，解决以往研究依赖合成数据或缺乏心理测量效度的问题。

Method: 使用555份半结构化访谈和BFI-10自评分数作为基准，测试三种LLM（GPT-4.1 Mini、Meta-LLaMA和DeepSeek）在零样本提示和思维链提示下的表现。

Result: 模型表现出高重测信度，但构念效度有限（最大Pearson's r=0.27），预测偏向中等或高特质水平。思维链提示和更长上下文仅略微改善分布对齐。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在人格推断中存在局限性，需进一步基于证据的开发以提升心理应用效果。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's GPT-4 and Meta's LLaMA offer a
promising approach for scalable personality assessment from open-ended
language. However, inferring personality traits remains challenging, and
earlier work often relied on synthetic data or social media text lacking
psychometric validity. We introduce a real-world benchmark of 555
semi-structured interviews with BFI-10 self-report scores for evaluating
LLM-based personality inference. Three state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4.1 Mini,
Meta-LLaMA, and DeepSeek) were tested using zero-shot prompting for BFI-10 item
prediction and both zero-shot and chain-of-thought prompting for Big Five trait
inference. All models showed high test-retest reliability, but construct
validity was limited: correlations with ground-truth scores were weak (max
Pearson's $r = 0.27$), interrater agreement was low (Cohen's $\kappa < 0.10$),
and predictions were biased toward moderate or high trait levels.
Chain-of-thought prompting and longer input context modestly improved
distributional alignment, but not trait-level accuracy. These results
underscore limitations in current LLM-based personality inference and highlight
the need for evidence-based development for psychological applications.

three components. First, we construct a knowledge graph that captures
up-to-date semantics by indexing database metadata, historical query logs,
wikis, and code. We apply clustering to identify relevant tables for each team
or product area. Second, we build a Text-to-SQL agent that retrieves and ranks
context from the knowledge graph, writes a query, and automatically corrects
hallucinations and syntax errors. Third, we build an interactive chatbot that
supports various user intents, from data discovery to query writing to
debugging, and displays responses in rich UI elements to encourage follow-up
chats. Our chatbot has over 300 weekly users. Expert review shows that 53% of
its responses are correct or close to correct on an internal benchmark set.
Through ablation studies, we identify the most important knowledge graph and
modeling components, offering a practical path for developing enterprise

Abstract: Relation Classification (RC) in biomedical texts is essential for
constructing knowledge graphs and enabling applications such as drug
repurposing and clinical decision-making. We propose an error-aware
teacher--student framework that improves RC through structured guidance from a
large language model (GPT-4o). Prediction failures from a baseline student
model are analyzed by the teacher to classify error types, assign difficulty
scores, and generate targeted remediations, including sentence rewrites and
suggestions for KG-based enrichment. These enriched annotations are used to
train a first student model via instruction tuning. This model then annotates a
broader dataset with difficulty scores and remediation-enhanced inputs. A
second student is subsequently trained via curriculum learning on this dataset,
ordered by difficulty, to promote robust and progressive learning. We also
construct a heterogeneous biomedical knowledge graph from PubMed abstracts to
support context-aware RC. Our approach achieves new state-of-the-art
performance on 4 of 5 PPI datasets and the DDI dataset, while remaining
competitive on ChemProt.

Abstract: Detecting collaborative problem solving (CPS) indicators from dialogue using
machine learning techniques is a significant challenge for the field of AI in
Education. Recent studies have explored the use of Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers (BERT) models on transcription data to
reliably detect meaningful CPS indicators. A notable advancement involved the
multimodal BERT variant, AudiBERT, which integrates speech and
acoustic-prosodic audio features to enhance CPS diagnosis. Although initial
results demonstrated multimodal improvements, the statistical significance of
these enhancements remained unclear, and there was insufficient guidance on
leveraging human-AI complementarity for CPS diagnosis tasks. This workshop
paper extends the previous research by highlighting that the AudiBERT model not
only improved the classification of classes that were sparse in the dataset,
but it also had statistically significant class-wise improvements over the BERT
model for classifications in the social-cognitive dimension. However, similar
significant class-wise improvements over the BERT model were not observed for
classifications in the affective dimension. A correlation analysis highlighted
that larger training data was significantly associated with higher recall
performance for both the AudiBERT and BERT models. Additionally, the precision
of the BERT model was significantly associated with high inter-rater agreement
among human coders. When employing the BERT model to diagnose indicators within
these subskills that were well-detected by the AudiBERT model, the performance
across all indicators was inconsistent. We conclude the paper by outlining a
structured approach towards achieving human-AI complementarity for CPS
diagnosis, highlighting the crucial inclusion of model explainability to
support human agency and engagement in the reflective coding process.

limited attention has been given to understanding how individual tokenised
words in the dataset contribute to the model's classification decisions.
Enhancing the explainability of BERT-based CPS diagnostics is essential to
better inform end users such as teachers, thereby fostering greater trust and
facilitating wider adoption in education. This study undertook a preliminary
step towards model transparency and explainability by using SHapley Additive
exPlanations (SHAP) to examine how different tokenised words in transcription
data contributed to a BERT model's classification of CPS processes. The
findings suggested that well-performing classifications did not necessarily
equate to a reasonable explanation for the classification decisions. Particular
tokenised words were used frequently to affect classifications. The analysis
also identified a spurious word, which contributed positively to the
classification but was not semantically meaningful to the class. While such
model transparency is unlikely to be useful to an end user to improve their
practice, it can help them not to overrely on LLM diagnostics and ignore their
human expertise. We conclude the workshop paper by noting that the extent to
which the model appropriately uses the tokens for its classification is
associated with the number of classes involved. It calls for an investigation
into the exploration of ensemble model architectures and the involvement of
human-AI complementarity for CPS diagnosis, since considerable human reasoning
is still required for fine-grained discrimination of CPS subskills.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在数据稀缺和类别不平衡的NLP任务中，传统数据增强方法（如改写和回译）与生成式方法（如GPT）的性能对比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决NLP任务中数据稀缺和类别不平衡的问题，探索传统方法在新一代模型中的潜力。

Method: 选择了改写、回译等方法，利用ChatGPT进行实验，比较四种数据增强方法在不同实验设置下的表现。

Result: 回译和改写方法在生成数据质量和分类性能上表现优于零样本和少样本生成方法。

Conclusion: 传统数据增强方法在新模型中仍具竞争力，甚至优于生成式方法。

Abstract: Numerous domain-specific machine learning tasks struggle with data scarcity
and class imbalance. This paper systematically explores data augmentation
methods for NLP, particularly through large language models like GPT. The
purpose of this paper is to examine and evaluate whether traditional methods
such as paraphrasing and backtranslation can leverage a new generation of
models to achieve comparable performance to purely generative methods. Methods
aimed at solving the problem of data scarcity and utilizing ChatGPT were
chosen, as well as an exemplary dataset. We conducted a series of experiments
comparing four different approaches to data augmentation in multiple
experimental setups. We then evaluated the results both in terms of the quality
of generated data and its impact on classification performance. The key
findings indicate that backtranslation and paraphrasing can yield comparable or
even better results than zero and a few-shot generation of examples.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在非洲初级医疗中的应用，提出了一种基于肯尼亚国家指南的评估框架，并创建了一个多语言数据集Alama Health QA，揭示了LLMs在本地化场景中的性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索LLMs在非洲低资源医疗环境中的有效性，填补其在本地化应用中的研究空白。

Method: 方法包括使用检索增强生成（RAG）技术，基于肯尼亚国家指南创建数据集，并通过专家评审确保临床准确性和文化适应性。

Result: 结果显示LLMs在本地化医疗场景中的表现显著低于美国基准，突出了性能差距。

Conclusion: 结论是提出了一个可复制的指南驱动动态评估模型，以支持非洲医疗系统中AI的安全部署。

Abstract: Large Language Models(LLMs) hold promise for improving healthcare access in
low-resource settings, but their effectiveness in African primary care remains
underexplored. We present a methodology for creating a benchmark dataset and
evaluation framework focused on Kenyan Level 2 and 3 clinical care. Our
approach uses retrieval augmented generation (RAG) to ground clinical questions
in Kenya's national guidelines, ensuring alignment with local standards. These
guidelines were digitized, chunked, and indexed for semantic retrieval. Gemini
Flash 2.0 Lite was then prompted with guideline excerpts to generate realistic
clinical scenarios, multiple-choice questions, and rationale based answers in
English and Swahili. Kenyan physicians co-created and refined the dataset, and
a blinded expert review process ensured clinical accuracy, clarity, and
cultural appropriateness. The resulting Alama Health QA dataset includes
thousands of regulator-aligned question answer pairs across common outpatient
conditions. Beyond accuracy, we introduce evaluation metrics that test clinical
reasoning, safety, and adaptability such as rare case detection (Needle in the
Haystack), stepwise logic (Decision Points), and contextual adaptability.
Initial results reveal significant performance gaps when LLMs are applied to
localized scenarios, consistent with findings that LLM accuracy is lower on
African medical content than on US-based benchmarks. This work offers a
replicable model for guideline-driven, dynamic benchmarking to support safe AI
deployment in African health systems.

Motivation: 探索Transformer模型中主宾关系的线性近似方法，以揭示语言模型中概念关系的可解释性。

Method: 使用Bigger Analogy Test Set，通过线性变换Ws（s为主语标记的中间层表示，W为模型导数）近似最终宾语状态。

Result: 在形态学关系上达到90%的忠实度，多语言和多模型实验验证了类似结果。

Conclusion: 语言模型中的某些概念关系（如形态学）可通过潜在空间的线性变换稀疏编码，具有较高的可解释性。

Abstract: A two-part affine approximation has been found to be a good approximation for
transformer computations over certain subject object relations. Adapting the
Bigger Analogy Test Set, we show that the linear transformation Ws, where s is
a middle layer representation of a subject token and W is derived from model
derivatives, is also able to accurately reproduce final object states for many
relations. This linear technique is able to achieve 90% faithfulness on
morphological relations, and we show similar findings multi-lingually and
across models. Our findings indicate that some conceptual relationships in
language models, such as morphology, are readily interpretable from latent
space, and are sparsely encoded by cross-layer linear transformations.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于聚类的语义一致性方法（Cleanse），用于估计大型语言模型（LLM）生成内容的不确定性，以检测幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在多种NLP任务中表现优异，但其生成的幻觉（不准确回答）问题严重影响了模型的安全性和可靠性。不确定性估计是区分正确与错误回答的关键。

Method: Cleanse通过聚类量化LLM隐藏嵌入中的语义一致性比例，以估计不确定性。

Result: 实验验证了Cleanse在LLaMA-7B、LLaMA-13B、LLaMA2-7B和Mistral-7B模型以及SQuAD和CoQA基准上的有效性。

Conclusion: Cleanse是一种有效的幻觉检测方法，有助于提升LLM的安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: Despite the outstanding performance of large language models (LLMs) across
various NLP tasks, hallucinations in LLMs--where LLMs generate inaccurate
responses--remains as a critical problem as it can be directly connected to a
crisis of building safe and reliable LLMs. Uncertainty estimation is primarily
used to measure hallucination levels in LLM responses so that correct and
incorrect answers can be distinguished clearly. This study proposes an
effective uncertainty estimation approach, \textbf{Cl}ust\textbf{e}ring-based
sem\textbf{an}tic con\textbf{s}ist\textbf{e}ncy (\textbf{Cleanse}). Cleanse
quantifies the uncertainty with the proportion of the intra-cluster consistency
in the total consistency between LLM hidden embeddings which contain adequate
semantic information of generations, by employing clustering. The effectiveness
of Cleanse for detecting hallucination is validated using four off-the-shelf
models, LLaMA-7B, LLaMA-13B, LLaMA2-7B and Mistral-7B and two
question-answering benchmarks, SQuAD and CoQA.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大规模语料库未能有效处理泰语脚本和文化细节，且缺乏透明度和可复现性。

Method: 采用泰语适应的Dolma流程，包括自定义语言识别、质量过滤器和内容过滤器，结合非网络来源数据。

Result: Mangosteen显著提升了模型性能，在泰语基准测试中超越现有模型。

Conclusion: Mangosteen为泰语及区域语言模型研究提供了透明、高质量的语料库基础。

Abstract: Pre-training data shapes a language model's quality, but raw web text is
noisy and demands careful cleaning. Existing large-scale corpora rely on
English-centric or language-agnostic pipelines whose heuristics do not capture
Thai script or cultural nuances, leaving risky material such as gambling
content untreated. Prior Thai-specific efforts customize pipelines or build new
ones, yet seldom release their data or document design choices, hindering
reproducibility and raising the question of how to construct a transparent,
high-quality Thai corpus. We introduce Mangosteen: a 47 billion-token Thai
corpus built through a Thai-adapted Dolma pipeline that includes custom
rule-based language ID, revised C4/Gopher quality filters, and Thai-trained
content filters, plus curated non-web sources such as Wikipedia, Royal Gazette
texts, OCR-extracted books, and CC-licensed YouTube subtitles. Systematic
ablations using GPT-2 show the pipeline trims CommonCrawl from 202M to 25M
documents while raising SEA-HELM NLG from 3 to 11; an 8B-parameter SEA-LION
model continually pre-trained on Mangosteen then surpasses SEA-LION-v3 and
Llama-3.1 by about four points on Thai benchmarks. We release the full pipeline
code, cleaning manifests, corpus snapshot, and all checkpoints, providing a
fully reproducible foundation for future Thai and regional LLM research.

Motivation: 医疗编码对研究、质量监测和政策制定至关重要。研究旨在探索LLMs在自动化ICPC-2编码中的应用潜力。

Method: 使用437个巴西葡萄牙语临床表达数据集，通过语义搜索引擎检索候选代码，33个LLMs选择最佳匹配代码，评估指标包括F1分数、成本等。

Result: 28个模型F1分数>0.8，10个>0.85；优化检索器可提升性能4分；小模型在格式和输入长度上表现较差。

Conclusion: LLMs在自动化ICPC-2编码中表现优异，但需更广泛的多语言和端到端临床验证。

Abstract: Background: Medical coding structures healthcare data for research, quality
monitoring, and policy. This study assesses the potential of large language
models (LLMs) to assign ICPC-2 codes using the output of a domain-specific
search engine.
  Methods: A dataset of 437 Brazilian Portuguese clinical expressions, each
annotated with ICPC-2 codes, was used. A semantic search engine (OpenAI's
text-embedding-3-large) retrieved candidates from 73,563 labeled concepts.
Thirty-three LLMs were prompted with each query and retrieved results to select
the best-matching ICPC-2 code. Performance was evaluated using F1-score, along
with token usage, cost, response time, and format adherence.
  Results: Twenty-eight models achieved F1-score > 0.8; ten exceeded 0.85. Top
performers included gpt-4.5-preview, o3, and gemini-2.5-pro. Retriever
optimization can improve performance by up to 4 points. Most models returned
valid codes in the expected format, with reduced hallucinations. Smaller models
(<3B) struggled with formatting and input length.
  Conclusions: LLMs show strong potential for automating ICPC-2 coding, even
without fine-tuning. This work offers a benchmark and highlights challenges,
but findings are limited by dataset scope and setup. Broader, multilingual,
end-to-end evaluations are needed for clinical validation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 封闭源推理语言模型（如GPT-3）缺乏透明度和可复现性，而现有开源项目也因缺少关键资源（如数据集和训练配置）而受限。

Method: 模型分两阶段训练：SFT（基于719K数学问题）和RLVR（基于62K挑战性问题），并引入Context-Aware Multi-Stage Policy Optimization算法。

Result: 模型在AIME24、AIME25和MATH基准测试中表现优异，达到或超过现有开源模型。

Conclusion: MiroMind-M1系列为社区提供了完整资源（模型、数据集、配置），支持进一步研究和社区发展。

Abstract: Large language models have recently evolved from fluent text generation to
advanced reasoning across diverse domains, giving rise to reasoning language
models. Among these domains, mathematical reasoning serves as a representative
benchmark as it requires precise multi-step logic and abstract reasoning, which
can be generalized to other tasks. While closed-source RLMs such as GPT-o3
demonstrate impressive reasoning capabilities, their proprietary nature limits
transparency and reproducibility. Although many open-source projects aim to
close this gap, most of them lack sufficient openness by omitting critical
resources such as datasets and detailed training configurations, which hinders
reproducibility. To contribute toward greater transparency in RLM development,
we introduce the MiroMind-M1 series, a set of fully open-source RLMs built on
the Qwen-2.5 backbone that match or exceed the performance of existing
open-source RLMs. Specifically, our models are trained in two stages: SFT on a
carefully curated corpus of 719K math-reasoning problems with verified CoT
trajectories, followed by RLVR on 62K challenging and verifiable problems. To
enhance the robustness and efficiency of the RLVR process, we introduce
Context-Aware Multi-Stage Policy Optimization, an algorithm that integrates
length-progressive training with an adaptive repetition penalty to encourage
context-aware RL training. Our model achieves state-of-the-art or competitive
performance and superior token efficiency among Qwen-2.5-based open-source 7B
and 32B models on the AIME24, AIME25, and MATH benchmarks. To facilitate
reproducibility, we release the complete stack: models (MiroMind-M1-SFT-7B,
MiroMind-M1-RL-7B, MiroMind-M1-RL-32B); datasets (MiroMind-M1-SFT-719K,
MiroMind-M1-RL-62K); and all training and evaluation configurations. We hope
these resources will support further research and foster community advancement.

Abstract: Post-training has emerged as a crucial technique for aligning pre-trained
Large Language Models (LLMs) with human instructions, significantly enhancing
their performance across a wide range of tasks. Central to this process is the
quality and diversity of post-training datasets. This paper presents a review
of publicly available Arabic post-training datasets on the Hugging Face Hub,
organized along four key dimensions: (1) LLM Capabilities (e.g., Question
Answering, Translation, Reasoning, Summarization, Dialogue, Code Generation,
and Function Calling); (2) Steerability (e.g., persona and system prompts); (3)
Alignment (e.g., cultural, safety, ethics, and fairness), and (4) Robustness.
Each dataset is rigorously evaluated based on popularity, practical adoption,
recency and maintenance, documentation and annotation quality, licensing
transparency, and scientific contribution. Our review revealed critical gaps in
the development of Arabic post-training datasets, including limited task
diversity, inconsistent or missing documentation and annotation, and low
adoption across the community. Finally, the paper discusses the implications of
these gaps on the progress of Arabic LLMs and applications while providing
concrete recommendations for future efforts in post-training dataset

Result: 发现流行模型在零样本迁移学习中表现不佳，强调心理健康NLP中数据和模型可靠性的重要性。

Conclusion: 呼吁在心理健康NLP中提高模型训练和数据集构建的透明度，优先考虑数据和模型的可靠性。

Abstract: Suicidal ideation detection is critical for real-time suicide prevention, yet
its progress faces two under-explored challenges: limited language coverage and
unreliable annotation practices. Most available datasets are in English, but
even among these, high-quality, human-annotated data remains scarce. As a
result, many studies rely on available pre-labeled datasets without examining
their annotation process or label reliability. The lack of datasets in other
languages further limits the global realization of suicide prevention via
artificial intelligence (AI). In this study, we address one of these gaps by
constructing a novel Turkish suicidal ideation corpus derived from social media
posts and introducing a resource-efficient annotation framework involving three
human annotators and two large language models (LLMs). We then address the
remaining gaps by performing a bidirectional evaluation of label reliability
and model consistency across this dataset and three popular English suicidal
ideation detection datasets, using transfer learning through eight pre-trained
sentiment and emotion classifiers. These transformers help assess annotation
consistency and benchmark model performance against manually labeled data. Our
findings underscore the need for more rigorous, language-inclusive approaches
to annotation and evaluation in mental health natural language processing (NLP)
while demonstrating the questionable performance of popular models with
zero-shot transfer learning. We advocate for transparency in model training and
dataset construction in mental health NLP, prioritizing data and model
reliability.

Method: 使用自然语言处理和大规模统计建模，分析8万多篇评审的语言特征，包括语气、情感和支持性语言，并考察匿名与署名评审的差异。

Result: 研究发现评审语言因作者性别、种族和机构背景而异，同时揭示匿名评审对公平性的影响与传统假设不符。

Conclusion: 研究结果对同行评审政策和科学进步提出重要问题，呼吁改革以消除隐性偏见。

Abstract: The peer review process is often regarded as the gatekeeper of scientific
integrity, yet increasing evidence suggests that it is not immune to bias.
Although structural inequities in peer review have been widely debated, much
less attention has been paid to the subtle ways in which language itself may
reinforce disparities. This study undertakes one of the most comprehensive
linguistic analyses of peer review to date, examining more than 80,000 reviews
in two major journals. Using natural language processing and large-scale
statistical modeling, it uncovers how review tone, sentiment, and supportive
language vary across author demographics, including gender, race, and
institutional affiliation. Using a data set that includes both anonymous and
signed reviews, this research also reveals how the disclosure of reviewer
identity shapes the language of evaluation. The findings not only expose hidden
biases in peer feedback, but also challenge conventional assumptions about
anonymity's role in fairness. As academic publishing grapples with reform,
these insights raise critical questions about how review policies shape career
trajectories and scientific progress.

Conclusion: 多模态神经网络在有限数据下具有鲁棒性，但学习模式受个体经验影响。

Abstract: What insights can machine learning bring to understanding human language
acquisition? Large language and multimodal models have achieved remarkable
capabilities, but their reliance on massive training datasets creates a
fundamental mismatch with children, who succeed in acquiring language from
comparatively limited input. To help bridge this gap, researchers have
increasingly trained neural networks using data similar in quantity and quality
to children's input. Taking this approach to the limit, Vong et al. (2024)
showed that a multimodal neural network trained on 61 hours of visual and
linguistic input extracted from just one child's developmental experience could
acquire word-referent mappings. However, whether this approach's success
reflects the idiosyncrasies of a single child's experience, or whether it would
show consistent and robust learning patterns across multiple children's
experiences was not explored. In this article, we applied automated speech
transcription methods to the entirety of the SAYCam dataset, consisting of over
500 hours of video data spread across all three children. Using these automated
transcriptions, we generated multi-modal vision-and-language datasets for both
training and evaluation, and explored a range of neural network configurations
to examine the robustness of simulated word learning. Our findings demonstrate
that networks trained on automatically transcribed data from each child can
acquire and generalize word-referent mappings across multiple network
architectures. These results validate the robustness of multimodal neural
networks for grounded word learning, while highlighting the individual
differences that emerge in how models learn when trained on each child's
developmental experiences.

Result: 在两个真实数据集上，GRACE显著优于现有方法，最高提升106.9% HR@10，并减少48%的计算成本。

Conclusion: GRACE通过改进标记化和注意力机制，为多行为推荐提供了高效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Generative models have recently demonstrated strong potential in
multi-behavior recommendation systems, leveraging the expressive power of
transformers and tokenization to generate personalized item sequences. However,
their adoption is hindered by (1) the lack of explicit information for token
reasoning, (2) high computational costs due to quadratic attention complexity
and dense sequence representations after tokenization, and (3) limited
multi-scale modeling over user history. In this work, we propose GRACE
(Generative Recommendation via journey-aware sparse Attention on
Chain-of-thought tokEnization), a novel generative framework for multi-behavior
sequential recommendation. GRACE introduces a hybrid Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
tokenization method that encodes user-item interactions with explicit
attributes from product knowledge graphs (e.g., category, brand, price) over
semantic tokenization, enabling interpretable and behavior-aligned generation.
To address the inefficiency of standard attention, we design a Journey-Aware
Sparse Attention (JSA) mechanism, which selectively attends to compressed,
intra-, inter-, and current-context segments in the tokenized sequence.
Experiments on two real-world datasets show that GRACE significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to +106.9% HR@10 and
+106.7% NDCG@10 improvement over the state-of-the-art baseline on the Home
domain, and +22.1% HR@10 on the Electronics domain. GRACE also reduces
attention computation by up to 48% with long sequences.

Conclusion: FastLongSpeech为LSLMs高效处理长语音提供了可行方案，填补了研究空白。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has spurred significant
progress in Large Speech-Language Models (LSLMs), enhancing their capabilities
in both speech understanding and generation. While existing LSLMs often
concentrate on augmenting speech generation or tackling a diverse array of
short-speech tasks, the efficient processing of long-form speech remains a
critical yet underexplored challenge. This gap is primarily attributed to the
scarcity of long-speech training datasets and the high computational costs
associated with long sequences. To address these limitations, we introduce
FastLongSpeech, a novel framework designed to extend LSLM capabilities for
efficient long-speech processing without necessitating dedicated long-speech
training data. FastLongSpeech incorporates an iterative fusion strategy that
can compress excessively long-speech sequences into manageable lengths. To
adapt LSLMs for long-speech inputs, it introduces a dynamic compression
training approach, which exposes the model to short-speech sequences at varying
compression ratios, thereby transferring the capabilities of LSLMs to
long-speech tasks. To assess the long-speech capabilities of LSLMs, we develop
a long-speech understanding benchmark called LongSpeech-Eval. Experiments show
that our method exhibits strong performance in both long-speech and
short-speech tasks, while greatly improving inference efficiency.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了意图驱动的文档图表生成问题，并通过新提出的评估指标验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
transforming text descriptions or tables to data visualizations via
instruction-tuning methods. However, it is not straightforward to apply these
methods directly for a more real-world use case of visualizing data from long
documents based on user-given intents, as opposed to the user pre-selecting the
relevant content manually. We introduce the task of intent-based chart
generation from documents: given a user-specified intent and document(s), the
goal is to generate a chart adhering to the intent and grounded on the
document(s) in a zero-shot setting. We propose an unsupervised, two-staged
framework in which an LLM first extracts relevant information from the
document(s) by decomposing the intent and iteratively validates and refines
this data. Next, a heuristic-guided module selects an appropriate chart type
before final code generation. To assess the data accuracy of the generated
charts, we propose an attribution-based metric that uses a structured textual
representation of charts, instead of relying on visual decoding metrics that
often fail to capture the chart data effectively. To validate our approach, we
curate a dataset comprising of 1,242 $<$intent, document, charts$>$ tuples from
two domains, finance and scientific, in contrast to the existing datasets that
are largely limited to parallel text descriptions/ tables and their
corresponding charts. We compare our approach with baselines using single-shot
chart generation using LLMs and query-based retrieval methods; our method
outperforms by upto $9$ points and $17$ points in terms of chart data accuracy
and chart type respectively over the best baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大规模推理蒸馏对上下文检索和推理能力的影响，特别是在RAG系统中。

Method: 使用从Deepseek-R1蒸馏的开源模型，通过多文档问答任务评估长上下文理解能力。

Result: 蒸馏显著提升长上下文理解，缓解“中间迷失”问题。

Conclusion: 推理蒸馏通过更详细的推理过程增强长上下文理解能力。

Abstract: Reasoning distillation has emerged as an effective approach to enhance the
reasoning capabilities of smaller language models. However, the impact of
large-scale reasoning distillation on other critical abilities, particularly
in-context retrieval and reasoning, remains unexplored. This gap in
understanding is particularly significant given the increasing importance of
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, where efficient acquisition and
utilization of contextual information are paramount for generating reliable
responses. Motivated by the need to understand how the extended long-CoT
process influences long-context comprehension, we conduct a comprehensive
investigation using a series of open-source models distilled from Deepseek-R1,
renowned for its exceptional reasoning capabilities. Our study focuses on
evaluating these models' performance in extracting and integrating relevant
information from extended contexts through multi-document question and
answering tasks. Through rigorous experimentation, we demonstrate that
distilled reasoning patterns significantly improve long-context understanding.
Our analysis reveals that distillation fosters greater long-context awareness
by promoting more detailed and explicit reasoning processes during context
analysis and information parsing. This advancement effectively mitigates the
persistent "lost in the middle" issue that has hindered long-context models.

TL;DR: 研究表明，即使是小规模的语言模型（TLMs）也能通过预训练展现出与大型语言模型（LLMs）类似的关键特性，且预训练效果显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大型语言模型（LLMs）预训练需要巨大的计算资源，限制了广泛的研究参与，因此探索更易获取的小规模语言模型（TLMs）的潜力。

Method: 通过预训练BERT-6和BERT-1变体在Wikipedia子集上，并在FewRel、AGNews和DBPedia分类任务中评估其性能。

Result: 预训练的小模型在分类任务中表现明显优于未预训练的模型，且性能差距随预训练数据量和任务重叠度增加而扩大。

Conclusion: 小规模语言模型（TLMs）的预训练效果显著，未来研究可能揭示其在自然语言处理中的潜力，尤其是对儿童或青少年语言发展的启发。

Abstract: A prominent achievement of natural language processing (NLP) is its ability
to understand and generate meaningful human language. This capability relies on
complex feedforward transformer block architectures pre-trained on large
language models (LLMs). However, LLM pre-training is currently feasible only
for a few dominant companies due to the immense computational resources
required, limiting broader research participation. This creates a critical need
for more accessible alternatives. In this study, we explore whether tiny
language models (TLMs) exhibit the same key qualitative features of LLMs. We
demonstrate that TLMs exhibit a clear performance gap between pre-trained and
non-pre-trained models across classification tasks, indicating the
effectiveness of pre-training, even at a tiny scale. The performance gap
increases with the size of the pre-training dataset and with greater overlap
between tokens in the pre-training and classification datasets. Furthermore,
the classification accuracy achieved by a pre-trained deep TLM architecture can
be replicated through a soft committee of multiple, independently pre-trained
shallow architectures, enabling low-latency TLMs without affecting
classification accuracy. Our results are based on pre-training BERT-6 and
variants of BERT-1 on subsets of the Wikipedia dataset and evaluating their
performance on FewRel, AGNews, and DBPedia classification tasks. Future
research on TLM is expected to further illuminate the mechanisms underlying
NLP, especially given that its biologically inspired models suggest that TLMs
may be sufficient for children or adolescents to develop language.

TL;DR: MEKiT方法通过整合内部情感知识和外部因果知识，显著提升大语言模型在情感-原因对提取任务（ECPE）中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）在情感-原因对提取任务中表现不佳，主要原因是缺乏辅助知识，限制了其感知情感和推理原因的能力。

Method: 提出MEKiT方法，整合内部情感知识和外部因果知识，通过指令模板和数据混合进行指令调优。

Result: 实验表明，MEKiT在ECPE任务中表现优于基线方法，显著提升LLMs的性能。

Conclusion: MEKiT为ECPE任务提供了更有效和适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) excel in text comprehension and
generation, their performance on the Emotion-Cause Pair Extraction (ECPE) task,
which requires reasoning ability, is often underperform smaller language model.
The main reason is the lack of auxiliary knowledge, which limits LLMs' ability
to effectively perceive emotions and reason causes. To address this issue, we
propose a novel \textbf{M}ulti-source h\textbf{E}terogeneous \textbf{K}nowledge
\textbf{i}njection me\textbf{T}hod, MEKiT, which integrates heterogeneous
internal emotional knowledge and external causal knowledge. Specifically, for
these two distinct aspects and structures of knowledge, we apply the approaches
of incorporating instruction templates and mixing data for instruction-tuning,
which respectively facilitate LLMs in more comprehensively identifying emotion
and accurately reasoning causes. Experimental results demonstrate that MEKiT
provides a more effective and adaptable solution for the ECPE task, exhibiting
an absolute performance advantage over compared baselines and dramatically
improving the performance of LLMs on the ECPE task.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SASFT的方法，通过稀疏自编码器分析LLMs中的意外语言切换问题，并指导监督微调，显著减少了语言混合现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在多语言能力上表现优异，但存在意外语言切换（代码切换）问题，影响模型输出的可读性和可用性。现有研究缺乏机制分析且效果有限。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器分析语言切换问题，发现特定语言特征在切换时存在过度预激活现象。基于此，提出SASFT方法，通过监督微调控制语言特征的预激活值。

Result: 在五种模型和三种语言上的实验表明，SASFT将意外语言切换减少了50%以上，并在四种情况下完全消除，同时保持或提升了多语言基准性能。

Conclusion: SASFT有效解决了LLMs中的意外语言切换问题，同时保持了其多语言能力，为模型优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have impressive multilingual capabilities, but
they suffer from unexpected code-switching, also known as language mixing,
which involves switching to unexpected languages in the model response. This
problem leads to poor readability and degrades the usability of model
responses. However, existing work on this issue lacks a mechanistic analysis
and shows limited effectiveness. In this paper, we first provide an in-depth
analysis of unexpected code-switching using sparse autoencoders and find that
when LLMs switch to a language, the features of that language exhibit excessive
pre-activation values. Based on our findings, we propose $\textbf{S}$parse
$\textbf{A}$utoencoder-guided $\textbf{S}$upervised
$\textbf{F}$ine$\textbf{t}$uning (SASFT), which teaches LLMs to maintain
appropriate pre-activation values of specific language features during
training. Experiments on five models across three languages demonstrate that
SASFT consistently reduces unexpected code-switching by more than 50\% compared
to standard supervised fine-tuning, with complete elimination in four cases.
Moreover, SASFT maintains or even improves the models' performance on six
multilingual benchmarks, showing its effectiveness in addressing code-switching
while preserving multilingual capabilities.

Motivation: 现有跨语言对齐评估方法主要关注句子嵌入，但神经网络模型表示空间不平滑，影响低资源语言的语义对齐评估。

Method: 提出NeuronXA方法，利用神经元状态评估跨语言对齐能力，基于神经科学发现（相似信息激活重叠神经元区域）。

Result: 在多个多语言大语言模型上测试，仅用100对平行句子，NeuronXA与下游任务性能的皮尔逊相关系数达0.9556，与可迁移性的相关系数达0.8514。

Conclusion: NeuronXA能有效评估跨语言对齐和可迁移性，即使数据量小，有望推动跨语言对齐研究和多语言大语言模型的语义理解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multilingual
capabilities, however, how to evaluate cross-lingual alignment remains
underexplored. Existing alignment benchmarks primarily focus on sentence
embeddings, but prior research has shown that neural models tend to induce a
non-smooth representation space, which impact of semantic alignment evaluation
on low-resource languages. Inspired by neuroscientific findings that similar
information activates overlapping neuronal regions, we propose a novel Neuron
State-Based Cross-Lingual Alignment (NeuronXA) to assess the cross-lingual a
lignment capabilities of LLMs, which offers a more semantically grounded
approach to assess cross-lingual alignment. We evaluate NeuronXA on several
prominent multilingual LLMs (LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral, GLM, and OLMo) across two
transfer tasks and three multilingual benchmarks. The results demonstrate that
with only 100 parallel sentence pairs, NeuronXA achieves a Pearson correlation
of 0.9556 with downstream tasks performance and 0.8514 with transferability.
These findings demonstrate NeuronXA's effectiveness in assessing both
cross-lingual alignment and transferability, even with a small dataset. This
highlights its potential to advance cross-lingual alignment research and to
improve the semantic understanding of multilingual LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 优化大型语言模型（LLM）在推理任务中的效率，避免因Test-Time Scaling（TTS）导致的过度计算问题。

Method: 提出MUR方法，利用动量概念动态分配推理预算，并通过gamma-control机制灵活调整预算。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，MUR平均减少50%以上的计算量，同时准确性提升0.62-3.37%。

Conclusion: MUR是一种无需额外训练的高效推理优化方法，显著提升了LLM的推理效率和性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance on
reasoning-intensive tasks, yet optimizing their reasoning efficiency remains an
open challenge. While Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves reasoning quality, it
often leads to overthinking, wasting tokens on redundant computations. This
work investigates how to efficiently and adaptively guide LLM test-time scaling
without additional training. Inspired by the concept of momentum in physics, we
propose Momentum Uncertainty-guided Reasoning (MUR), which dynamically
allocates thinking budgets to critical reasoning steps by tracking and
aggregating stepwise uncertainty over time. To support flexible inference-time
control, we introduce gamma-control, a simple mechanism that tunes the
reasoning budget via a single hyperparameter. We provide in-depth theoretical
proof to support the superiority of MUR in terms of stability and biases. MUR
is comprehensively evaluated against various TTS methods across four
challenging benchmarks (MATH-500, AIME24, AIME25, and GPQA-diamond) using
different sizes of recent Qwen3 models (1.7B, 4B, and 8B). Results demonstrate
that MUR reduces computation by over 50% on average while improving accuracy by
0.62-3.37%.

Motivation: 现有监督微调方法在构建批评模块时效果有限，无法生成高质量、可操作的反馈。

Method: 提出RefCritic，基于强化学习，结合实例级正确性和策略模型细化准确性的双规则奖励机制。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，RefCritic表现优异，如AIME25上分别提升6.8%和7.2%。

Conclusion: RefCritic在批评和细化任务中表现卓越，且优于步级监督方法。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), developing
effective critic modules for precise guidance has become crucial yet
challenging. In this paper, we initially demonstrate that supervised
fine-tuning for building critic modules (which is widely adopted in current
solutions) fails to genuinely enhance models' critique abilities, producing
superficial critiques with insufficient reflections and verifications. To
unlock the unprecedented critique capabilities, we propose RefCritic, a
long-chain-of-thought critic module based on reinforcement learning with dual
rule-based rewards: (1) instance-level correctness of solution judgments and
(2) refinement accuracies of the policy model based on critiques, aiming to
generate high-quality evaluations with actionable feedback that effectively
guides model refinement. We evaluate RefCritic on Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct and
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B across five benchmarks. On critique and refinement
settings, RefCritic demonstrates consistent advantages across all benchmarks,
e.g., 6.8\% and 7.2\% gains on AIME25 for the respective base models. Notably,
under majority voting, policy models filtered by RefCritic show superior
scaling with increased voting numbers. Moreover, despite training on
solution-level supervision, RefCritic outperforms step-level supervised
approaches on ProcessBench, a benchmark to identify erroneous steps in
mathematical reasoning.

Result: 在GAIA和WebWalkerQA基准测试中，WebShaper实现了开源IS代理中最先进的性能。

Conclusion: WebShaper通过形式化驱动的数据合成，显著提升了IS代理的性能。

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Model (LLM)-powered agents has revolutionized
artificial intelligence by enabling solutions to complex, open-ended tasks
through web-based information-seeking (IS) capabilities. The scarcity of
high-quality training data has limited the development of IS agents. Existing
approaches typically adopt an information-driven paradigm that first collects
web data and then generates questions based on the retrieval. However, this may
lead to inconsistency between information structure and reasoning structure,
question and answer. To mitigate, we propose a formalization-driven IS data
synthesis framework WebShaper to construct a dataset. WebShaper systematically
formalizes IS tasks through set theory. Central to the formalization is the
concept of Knowledge Projections (KP), which enables precise control over
reasoning structure by KP operation compositions. During synthesis, we begin by
creating seed tasks, then use a multi-step expansion process. At each step, an
agentic Expander expands the current formal question more complex with
retrieval and validation tools based on our formalization. We train our model
on the synthesized dataset. Experiment results demonstrate that WebShaper
achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-sourced IS agents on GAIA and
WebWalkerQA benchmarks.

Motivation: 缺乏对DNA序列标记化和位置编码方法的系统评估，需确定最佳实践。

Method: 比较不同k-mer分割、BPE词汇表和位置编码方法，训练不同深度的Transformer编码器，并在GUE数据集上评估。

Result: BPE表现更稳定，RoPE适合周期性模式，AliBi适合局部依赖；3到12层性能显著提升，24层改进有限。

Conclusion: 为DNA Transformer模型的标记化和位置编码设计提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Currently, many studies view DNA sequences as a special type of language and
utilize Transformers to model them. These studies use fixed-length k-mer
segmentation and BPE subword tokenization but lack a systematic evaluation to
determine which is superior. We compare k-mer segmentation with k=1,3,4,5,6, a
4,096-token BPE vocabulary, and three positional encoding methods-sinusoidal,
AliBi, and RoPE. Each configuration is trained from scratch in 3, 6, 12, and
24-layer Transformer encoders and evaluated on GUE benchmark dataset. In
general, BPE delivers higher and more stable performance across tasks by
compressing frequent motifs into variable-length tokens, reducing sequence
length, and improving model generalization. RoPE excels at capturing periodic
motifs and extrapolating to long sequences, while AliBi also performs well on
tasks driven by local dependencies. In terms of depth, we observe significant
gains when increasing layers from 3 to 12, with only marginal improvements or
slight overfitting at 24 layers. This study provides practical guidance for
designing tokenization and positional encoding in DNA Transformer models.

Result: 结果表明PATTR能有效减少长度偏差，并在筛选多样性文本时优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 结论是PATTR是一种更有效的词汇多样性度量工具，适用于需要控制文本长度的任务。

Abstract: Synthetic text generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasingly used
for further training and improvement of LLMs. Diversity is crucial for the
effectiveness of synthetic data, and researchers rely on prompt engineering to
improve diversity. However, the impact of prompt variations on response text
length, and, more importantly, the consequential effect on lexical diversity
measurements, remain underexplored. In this work, we propose Penalty-Adjusted
Type-Token Ratio (PATTR), a diversity metric robust to length variations. We
generate a large synthetic corpus of over 20M words using seven models from the
LLaMA, OLMo, and Phi families, focusing on a creative writing task of video
script generation, where diversity is crucial. We evaluate per-response lexical
diversity using PATTR and compare it against existing metrics of Moving-Average
TTR (MATTR) and Compression Ratio (CR). Our analysis highlights how text length
variations introduce biases favoring shorter responses. Unlike existing
metrics, PATTR explicitly considers the task-specific target response length
($L_T$) to effectively mitigate length biases. We further demonstrate the
utility of PATTR in filtering the top-10/100/1,000 most lexically diverse
responses, showing that it consistently outperforms MATTR and CR by yielding on
par or better diversity with high adherence to $L_T$.

Motivation: 现有常识资源对多种前提-假设对的覆盖不足，因此研究LLM是否能生成可靠的常识知识以提升NLI任务表现。

Method: 调整和修改现有指标，评估LLM生成知识的真实性和一致性。

Result: 显式加入常识知识并未一致提升整体结果，但能有效区分蕴含实例，并适度改善对矛盾和中立推理的区分。

Conclusion: LLM生成的常识知识在NLI任务中具有潜力，但其应用需进一步优化。

Abstract: Natural Language Inference (NLI) is the task of determining the semantic
entailment of a premise for a given hypothesis. The task aims to develop
systems that emulate natural human inferential processes where commonsense
knowledge plays a major role. However, existing commonsense resources lack
sufficient coverage for a variety of premise-hypothesis pairs. This study
explores the potential of Large Language Models as commonsense knowledge
generators for NLI along two key dimensions: their reliability in generating
such knowledge and the impact of that knowledge on prediction accuracy. We
adapt and modify existing metrics to assess LLM factuality and consistency in
generating in this context. While explicitly incorporating commonsense
knowledge does not consistently improve overall results, it effectively helps
distinguish entailing instances and moderately improves distinguishing
contradictory and neutral inferences.

Conclusion: 呼吁开发新的标注资源和无监督检测方法，以构建更健壮、可解释且与人类对齐的NLI系统。

Abstract: This position paper argues that annotation disagreement in Natural Language
Inference (NLI) is not mere noise but often reflects meaningful interpretive
variation, especially when triggered by ambiguity in the premise or hypothesis.
While underspecified guidelines and annotator behavior can contribute to
variation, content-based ambiguity offers a process-independent signal of
divergent human perspectives. We call for a shift toward ambiguity-aware NLI by
systematically identifying ambiguous input pairs and classifying ambiguity
types. To support this, we present a unified framework that integrates existing
taxonomies and illustrate key ambiguity subtypes through concrete examples.
These examples reveal how ambiguity shapes annotator decisions and motivate the
need for targeted detection methods that better align models with human
interpretation. A key limitation is the lack of datasets annotated for
ambiguity and subtypes. We propose addressing this gap through new annotated
resources and unsupervised approaches to ambiguity detection -- paving the way
for more robust, explainable, and human-aligned NLI systems.

Motivation: 研究同音字归一化对模型性能及跨语言迁移的影响，避免归一化导致的语言特征丢失。

Method: 实验单语训练和跨语言迁移，提出后推断归一化方案。

Result: 后推断归一化使BLEU分数提升1.03，同时保留语言特征。

Conclusion: 呼吁更多语言感知的干预措施，促进技术驱动的语言变化讨论。

Abstract: Homophone normalization, where characters that have the same sound in a
writing script are mapped to one character, is a pre-processing step applied in
Amharic Natural Language Processing (NLP) literature. While this may improve
performance reported by automatic metrics, it also results in models that are
not able to understand different forms of writing in a single language.
Further, there might be impacts in transfer learning, where models trained on
normalized data do not generalize well to other languages. In this paper, we
experiment with monolingual training and cross-lingual transfer to understand
the impacts of normalization on languages that use the Ge'ez script. We then
propose a post-inference intervention in which normalization is applied to
model predictions instead of training data. With our simple scheme of
post-inference normalization, we show that we can achieve an increase in BLEU
score of up to 1.03 while preserving language features in training. Our work
contributes to the broader discussion on technology-facilitated language change
and calls for more language-aware interventions.

TL;DR: 评估三种LLM在医学领域数据提取任务中的表现，发现定制提示最有效，并提出分层自动化指南。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化从RCT中提取数据用于荟萃分析仍具挑战性，需评估LLM的实际表现。

Method: 测试三种LLM在高血压、糖尿病和骨科领域的数据提取任务，比较四种提示策略。

Result: 模型精度高但召回率低，定制提示可提升召回率15%。

Conclusion: 提出分层自动化指南，平衡LLM效率与专家监督，适用于实际荟萃分析。

Abstract: Automating data extraction from full-text randomised controlled trials (RCTs)
for meta-analysis remains a significant challenge. This study evaluates the
practical performance of three LLMs (Gemini-2.0-flash, Grok-3, GPT-4o-mini)
across tasks involving statistical results, risk-of-bias assessments, and
study-level characteristics in three medical domains: hypertension, diabetes,
and orthopaedics. We tested four distinct prompting strategies (basic
prompting, self-reflective prompting, model ensemble, and customised prompts)
to determine how to improve extraction quality. All models demonstrate high
precision but consistently suffer from poor recall by omitting key information.
We found that customised prompts were the most effective, boosting recall by up
to 15\%. Based on this analysis, we propose a three-tiered set of guidelines
for using LLMs in data extraction, matching data types to appropriate levels of
automation based on task complexity and risk. Our study offers practical advice
for automating data extraction in real-world meta-analyses, balancing LLM
efficiency with expert oversight through targeted, task-specific automation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于多教师模型的知识蒸馏方法，通过融合多个教师模型的输出概率分布和中间语义特征，指导学生模型学习，从而在保持小参数规模的同时提升语言理解和生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型部署时的高计算成本和推理速度慢的问题。

Method: 采用加权输出融合机制、特征对齐损失函数和熵驱动的动态教师权重策略，优化知识蒸馏过程。

Result: 学生模型在语言建模、文本生成和多任务学习中表现出色，实验验证了其在困惑度、蒸馏损失和生成质量上的优势。

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模语言模型的高效压缩提供了可行技术路径，并验证了多教师协作机制在复杂语言任务中的有效性。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of high computational cost and slow
inference in deploying large language models. It proposes a distillation
strategy guided by multiple teacher models. The method constructs several
teacher models and integrates their output probability distributions and
intermediate semantic features. This guides the student model to learn from
multiple sources of knowledge. As a result, the student model gains stronger
language understanding and generation ability while maintaining a small
parameter size. To achieve this, the paper introduces a weighted output fusion
mechanism, a feature alignment loss function, and an entropy-driven dynamic
teacher weighting strategy. These components improve the quality and stability
of knowledge transfer during distillation. Under multi-teacher guidance, the
student model captures semantic information more effectively and demonstrates
strong performance across multiple evaluation metrics. In particular, the
method shows high consistency in expression, generalization ability, and task
adaptability in tasks such as language modeling, text generation, and
multi-task learning. The experiments compare the proposed method with several
widely adopted distillation approaches. The results further confirm its overall
advantages in perplexity, distillation loss, and generation quality. This study
provides a feasible technical path for the efficient compression of large-scale
language models. It also demonstrates the effectiveness of multi-teacher
collaborative mechanisms in complex language modeling tasks.

Motivation: 探索多任务、多语言和多源学习对语言模型性能的影响，以优化模型在多场景下的表现。

Method: 引入SOI框架分析学习行为，通过热图和数据集可视化比较单设置与多设置配置，并设计两阶段微调方法。

Result: 多源学习显著提升分布外性能（7%），多任务学习在相似任务组合中表现优异，两阶段微调进一步优化性能。

Conclusion: 多源学习效果显著，SOI框架为优化多设置语言模型提供了新思路和实践方法。

Abstract: This work investigates the impact of multi-task, multi-lingual, and
multi-source learning approaches on the robustness and performance of
pretrained language models. To enhance this analysis, we introduce Subsets of
Interest (SOI), a novel categorization framework that identifies six distinct
learning behavior patterns during training, including forgettable examples,
unlearned examples, and always correct examples. Through SOI transition
heatmaps and dataset cartography visualization, we analyze how examples shift
between these categories when transitioning from single-setting to
multi-setting configurations. We perform comprehensive experiments across three
parallel comparisons: multi-task vs. single-task learning using English tasks
(entailment, paraphrase, sentiment), multi-source vs. single-source learning
using sentiment analysis datasets, and multi-lingual vs. single-lingual
learning using intent classification in French, English, and Persian. Our
results demonstrate that multi-source learning consistently improves
out-of-distribution performance by up to 7%, while multi-task learning shows
mixed results with notable gains in similar task combinations. We further
introduce a two-stage fine-tuning approach where the second stage leverages
SOI-based subset selection to achieve additional performance improvements.
These findings provide new insights into training dynamics and offer practical
approaches for optimizing multi-setting language model performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有中文医疗数据集规模小、领域覆盖窄，无法满足预训练需求，且大多不支持RLHF。

Method: 提出ChiMed 2.0数据集，包含预训练、SFT和RLHF数据，并在通用LLM上进行实验验证。

Result: 实验结果显示不同规模模型的性能提升，验证了数据集的有效性。

Conclusion: ChiMed 2.0为中文医疗LLM训练提供了高质量数据资源。

Abstract: Building high-quality data resources is crucial for advancing artificial
intelligence research and applications in specific domains, particularly in the
Chinese medical domain. Existing Chinese medical datasets are limited in size
and narrow in domain coverage, falling short of the diverse corpora required
for effective pre-training. Moreover, most datasets are designed solely for LLM
fine-tuning and do not support pre-training and reinforcement learning from
human feedback (RLHF). In this paper, we propose a Chinese medical dataset
named ChiMed 2.0, which extends our previous work ChiMed, and covers data
collected from Chinese medical online platforms and generated by LLMs. ChiMed
2.0 contains 204.4M Chinese characters covering both traditional Chinese
medicine classics and modern general medical data, where there are 164.8K
documents for pre-training, 351.6K question-answering pairs for supervised
fine-tuning (SFT), and 41.7K preference data tuples for RLHF. To validate the
effectiveness of our approach for training a Chinese medical LLM, we conduct
further pre-training, SFT, and RLHF experiments on representative general
domain LLMs and evaluate their performance on medical benchmark datasets. The
results show performance gains across different model scales, validating the
dataset's effectiveness and applicability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后训练策略（如基于记忆的检索或偏好优化）未能提升模型的领域认知能力，因此需要一种新方法填补这一空白。

Method: DPSE框架引入Censor模块提取多维交互信号并估计满意度分数，通过主题感知和偏好驱动策略扩展结构化数据，支持两阶段微调流程。

Result: 实验表明DPSE在通用NLP基准和长期对话任务中优于监督微调、偏好优化和基于记忆的基线方法。

Conclusion: DPSE为LLM的持续自进化提供了一条自主路径。

Abstract: The capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are limited to some extent
by pre-training, so some researchers optimize LLMs through post-training.
Existing post-training strategies, such as memory-based retrieval or preference
optimization, improve user alignment yet fail to enhance the model's domain
cognition. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel Dual-Phase Self-Evolution
(DPSE) framework that jointly optimizes user preference adaptation and
domain-specific competence. DPSE introduces a Censor module to extract
multi-dimensional interaction signals and estimate satisfaction scores, which
guide structured data expansion via topic-aware and preference-driven
strategies. These expanded datasets support a two-stage fine-tuning pipeline:
supervised domain grounding followed by frequency-aware preference
optimization. Experiments across general NLP benchmarks and long-term dialogue
tasks demonstrate that DPSE consistently outperforms Supervised Fine-Tuning,
Preference Optimization, and Memory-Augmented baselines. Ablation studies
validate the contribution of each module. In this way, our framework provides
an autonomous path toward continual self-evolution of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法过于依赖传统指标（如AUROC），忽视了实际部署中的误报率和稳定性问题。

Method: SHIELD基准整合了可靠性和稳定性因素，并提出了一种可控的人类化框架。

Result: SHIELD能有效挑战现有零样本检测方法，提升检测器的实际性能。

Conclusion: SHIELD为AI文本检测器的实际部署提供了更全面的评估标准。

Abstract: We present a novel evaluation paradigm for AI text detectors that prioritizes
real-world and equitable assessment. Current approaches predominantly report
conventional metrics like AUROC, overlooking that even modest false positive
rates constitute a critical impediment to practical deployment of detection
systems. Furthermore, real-world deployment necessitates predetermined
threshold configuration, making detector stability (i.e. the maintenance of
consistent performance across diverse domains and adversarial scenarios), a
critical factor. These aspects have been largely ignored in previous research
and benchmarks. Our benchmark, SHIELD, addresses these limitations by
integrating both reliability and stability factors into a unified evaluation
metric designed for practical assessment. Furthermore, we develop a post-hoc,
model-agnostic humanification framework that modifies AI text to more closely
resemble human authorship, incorporating a controllable hardness parameter.
This hardness-aware approach effectively challenges current SOTA zero-shot
detection methods in maintaining both reliability and stability. (Data and

Motivation: 探讨AI对齐原则与政治偏见之间的关系，揭示对齐目标与左翼价值观的内在一致性。

Method: 通过分析AI对齐的规范性假设与政治意识形态的冲突，论证左翼偏见的必然性。

Result: 研究发现，AI对齐的价值观（如避免伤害、公平）与左翼原则一致，而右翼意识形态与之冲突。

Conclusion: 将左翼偏见视为问题实际上违背了AI对齐的核心原则，研究者应重新审视这一偏见的意义。

Abstract: The guiding principle of AI alignment is to train large language models
(LLMs) to be harmless, helpful, and honest (HHH). At the same time, there are
mounting concerns that LLMs exhibit a left-wing political bias. Yet, the
commitment to AI alignment cannot be harmonized with the latter critique. In
this article, I argue that intelligent systems that are trained to be harmless
and honest must necessarily exhibit left-wing political bias. Normative
assumptions underlying alignment objectives inherently concur with progressive
moral frameworks and left-wing principles, emphasizing harm avoidance,
inclusivity, fairness, and empirical truthfulness. Conversely, right-wing
ideologies often conflict with alignment guidelines. Yet, research on political
bias in LLMs is consistently framing its insights about left-leaning tendencies
as a risk, as problematic, or concerning. This way, researchers are actively
arguing against AI alignment, tacitly fostering the violation of HHH
principles.

TL;DR: 论文研究了多选问答（MCQA）是否仍能作为评估大型语言模型（LLMs）下游性能的有效代理，发现其有效性取决于推理方式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨MCQA作为评估LLMs性能的代理是否仍然有效，尤其是在现代推理模型背景下。

Method: 系统评估了15个问答基准和25个LLMs，测试了5种不同的提问方式，包括是否提供选项、是否允许链式推理等。

Result: MCQA在模型仅能在提供选项前进行链式推理时仍有效，但若允许推理后选择，模型会利用选项信息显著超越自由文本表现。

Conclusion: MCQA不再适合评估现代LLMs的下游性能，需设计更鲁棒、无偏见的基准以反映真实推理能力。

Abstract: When evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) in question-answering domains,
it is common to ask the model to choose among a fixed set of choices (so-called
multiple-choice question-answering, or MCQA). Although downstream tasks of
interest typically do not provide systems with explicit options among which to
choose, this approach is nevertheless widely used because it makes it makes
automatic grading straightforward and has tended to produce challenging
benchmarks that correlate sufficiently well with downstream performance. This
paper investigates the extent to which this trend continues to hold for
state-of-the-art reasoning models, describing a systematic evaluation of $15$
different question-answering benchmarks (e.g., MMLU, HLE) and $25$ different
LLMs (including small models such as Qwen 7B and relatively large models such
as Llama 70B). For each model-benchmark pair, we considered $5$ ways of
presenting the model with questions, including variations on whether multiple
choices were offered to the model at all; whether "none of the above" sometimes
replaced the right answer; and whether the model was permitted to perform
chain-of-thought reasoning before and/or after the choices were presented. MCQA
remained a good proxy for the downstream performance of models as long as they
were allowed to perform chain-of-thought reasoning only before being presented
with the options among which they had to select. On the other hand, large
models that were able to perform reasoning after being given a set of options
tended to significantly outperform their free-text performance due to
exploiting the information in the options. We conclude that MCQA is no longer a
good proxy for assessing downstream performance of state-of-the-art models, and
offer practical guidelines for designing more robust, bias-resistant benchmarks
that better reflect LLMs' genuine reasoning capabilities.

Motivation: 现代审核系统在多语言支持上存在本地化和低资源变体的不足，导致实际部署中的安全漏洞。小型模型可作为大型LLM的替代方案，但仍需大量数据和计算资源。

Method: 基于预训练的OpenAI嵌入和多头序数分类器构建，支持四种语言。

Result: 在17个基准测试中表现优异，包括新加坡特定和公共英语数据集，已在新加坡政府中实际部署。

Conclusion: 高质量本地数据和强大多语言嵌入可在不微调大型模型的情况下实现强审核性能，模型权重和部分训练数据已公开。

Abstract: Modern moderation systems increasingly support multiple languages, but often
fail to address localisation and low-resource variants - creating safety gaps
in real-world deployments. Small models offer a potential alternative to large
LLMs, yet still demand considerable data and compute. We present LionGuard 2, a
lightweight, multilingual moderation classifier tailored to the Singapore
context, supporting English, Chinese, Malay, and partial Tamil. Built on
pre-trained OpenAI embeddings and a multi-head ordinal classifier, LionGuard 2
outperforms several commercial and open-source systems across 17 benchmarks,
including both Singapore-specific and public English datasets. The system is
actively deployed within the Singapore Government, demonstrating practical
efficacy at scale. Our findings show that high-quality local data and robust
multilingual embeddings can achieve strong moderation performance, without
fine-tuning large models. We release our model weights and part of our training
data to support future work on LLM safety.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of the capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs) in metaphor interpretation across multiple datasets,
tasks, and prompt configurations. Although metaphor processing has gained
significant attention in Natural Language Processing (NLP), previous research
has been limited to single-dataset evaluations and specific task settings,
often using artificially constructed data through lexical replacement. We
address these limitations by conducting extensive experiments using diverse
publicly available datasets with inference and metaphor annotations, focusing
on Natural Language Inference (NLI) and Question Answering (QA) tasks. The
results indicate that LLMs' performance is more influenced by features like
lexical overlap and sentence length than by metaphorical content, demonstrating
that any alleged emergent abilities of LLMs to understand metaphorical language
are the result of a combination of surface-level features, in-context learning,
and linguistic knowledge. This work provides critical insights into the current
capabilities and limitations of LLMs in processing figurative language,
highlighting the need for more realistic evaluation frameworks in metaphor
interpretation tasks. Data and code are publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音语言模型缺乏内部无声推理能力，而人类通常通过内部复杂推理清晰表达。

Method: Stitch方法交替生成无声推理块和语音响应块，利用语音播放时间生成推理块，实现同时思考和说话。

Result: Stitch在数学推理数据集上比基线模型提升15%，在非推理数据集上表现相当，且延迟与基线一致。

Conclusion: Stitch成功实现了语音语言模型的无声推理能力，同时保持低延迟和高性能。

Abstract: Spoken Language Models (SLMs) are designed to take speech inputs and produce
spoken responses. However, current SLMs lack the ability to perform an
internal, unspoken thinking process before responding. In contrast, humans
typically engage in complex mental reasoning internally, enabling them to
communicate ideas clearly and concisely. Thus, integrating an unspoken thought
process into SLMs is highly desirable. While naively generating a complete
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning before starting to talk can enable thinking
for SLMs, this induces additional latency for the speech response, as the CoT
reasoning can be arbitrarily long. To solve this issue, we propose Stitch, a
novel generation method that alternates between the generation of unspoken
reasoning chunks and spoken response chunks. Since the audio duration of a
chunk of spoken response is much longer than the time to generate the tokens in
a chunk of spoken response, we use the remaining free time to generate the
unspoken reasoning tokens. When a chunk of audio is played to the user, the
model continues to generate the next unspoken reasoning chunk, achieving
simultaneous thinking and talking. Remarkably, Stitch matches the latency of
baselines that cannot generate unspoken CoT by design while outperforming those
baselines by 15% on math reasoning datasets; Stitch also performs equally well
on non-reasoning datasets as those baseline models. Some animations and
demonstrations are on the project page: https://d223302.github.io/STITCH.

Motivation: 探索LLMs在训练数据较少的相关领域中识别算法相似问题的能力，填补研究空白。

Method: 引入AlgoSimBench基准，包含1317个问题和402个多选题，提出ASM方法改进相似问题检测。

Result: 最佳模型（o3-mini）在MCQ任务中准确率仅65.9%，ASM方法提升6.7%-11.7%。代码嵌入模型和检索方法在特定条件下可达52.2%准确率。

Conclusion: LLMs在识别算法相似问题上仍有挑战，ASM方法显著提升性能，未来可结合其他技术进一步优化。

Abstract: Recent progress in LLMs, such as reasoning models, has demonstrated strong
abilities to solve complex competitive programming problems, often rivaling top
human competitors. However, it remains underexplored whether these abilities
generalize to relevant domains that are less seen during training. To address
this, we introduce AlgoSimBench, a new benchmark designed to assess LLMs'
ability to identify algorithmically similar problems (ASPs)-problems that can
be solved using similar algorithmic approaches. AlgoSimBench consists of 1317
problems, annotated with 231 distinct fine-grained algorithm tags, from which
we curate 402 multiple-choice questions (MCQs), where each question presents
one algorithmically similar problem alongside three textually similar but
algorithmically dissimilar distractors. Our evaluation reveals that LLMs
struggle to identify ASPs, with the best-performing model (o3-mini) achieving
only 65.9% accuracy on the MCQ task. To address this challenge, we propose
attempted solution matching (ASM), a novel method for improving problem
similarity detection. On our MCQ task, ASM yields an absolute accuracy
improvement of 6.7% to 11.7% across different models. We also evaluated code
embedding models and retrieval methods on similar problem identification. While
the adversarial selection of problems degrades the performance to be less than
random, we found that simply summarizing the problem to remove narrative
elements eliminates the effect, and combining ASM with a keyword-prioritized
method, BM25, can yield up to 52.2% accuracy. Code and data are available at

Abstract: This work evaluates the potential of large language models (LLMs) to power
digital assistants capable of complex action execution. These assistants rely
on pre-trained programming knowledge to execute multi-step goals by composing
objects and functions defined in assistant libraries into action execution
programs. To achieve this, we develop ASPERA, a framework comprising an
assistant library simulation and a human-assisted LLM data generation engine.
Our engine allows developers to guide LLM generation of high-quality tasks
consisting of complex user queries, simulation state and corresponding
validation programs, tackling data availability and evaluation robustness
challenges. Alongside the framework we release Asper-Bench, an evaluation
dataset of 250 challenging tasks generated using ASPERA, which we use to show
that program generation grounded in custom assistant libraries is a significant
challenge to LLMs compared to dependency-free code generation.

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) is a promising approach to progressively elicit the
model's intelligence during inference. Recently, training-based TTS methods,
such as continued reinforcement learning (RL), have further surged in
popularity, while training-free TTS methods are gradually fading from
prominence. However, the additional computation overhead of training amplifies
the burden on test-time scaling. In this paper, we focus on training-free TTS
methods for reasoning. We first design Conditional Step-level Self-refinement,
a fine-grained sequential scaling method guided by process verification. On top
of its effectiveness, we further combine it with other classical parallel
scaling methods at the step level, to introduce a novel inference paradigm
called Hybrid Test-Time Scaling. Extensive experiments on five
instruction-tuned LLMs across different scales (3B-14B) and families
demonstrate that hybrid strategy incorporating various training-free TTS
methods at a fine granularity has considerable potential for expanding the
reasoning performance boundaries of LLMs.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了多语言文本去毒化评估的挑战，比较了自动指标与人类判断的差异，并提出了更可靠的评估方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在文本风格转换（TST）评估中多集中于英语，且自动指标与人类判断存在显著差距，亟需多语言评估研究。

Method: 通过九种语言的文本去毒化系统评估，结合神经模型和基于提示的LLM评估方法。

Result: 研究发现为设计更可靠的多语言TST评估流程提供了实用方案。

Conclusion: 论文填补了多语言TST评估的空白，为未来研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in large language models (LLMs), evaluation of text
generation tasks such as text style transfer (TST) remains a significant
challenge. Recent studies (Dementieva et al., 2024; Pauli et al., 2025)
revealed a substantial gap between automatic metrics and human judgments.
Moreover, most prior work focuses exclusively on English, leaving multilingual
TST evaluation largely unexplored. In this paper, we perform the first
comprehensive multilingual study on evaluation of text detoxification system
across nine languages: English, Spanish, German, Chinese, Arabic, Hindi,
Ukrainian, Russian, Amharic. Drawing inspiration from the machine translation,
we assess the effectiveness of modern neural-based evaluation models alongside
prompting-based LLM-as-a-judge approaches. Our findings provide a practical
recipe for designing more reliable multilingual TST evaluation pipeline in the
text detoxification case.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于上下文学习（ICL）和视觉语言模型（VLM）的太赫兹（THz）图像分类方法，无需微调即可实现灵活且可解释的分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 太赫兹成像在安全筛查和材料分类等应用中具有潜力，但由于标注数据有限、分辨率低和视觉模糊等问题，分类效果受限。

Method: 采用模态对齐的提示框架，将两种开源的VLM模型适配到THz领域，并在零样本和单样本设置下评估。

Result: 结果表明，ICL在低数据情况下提升了分类性能和可解释性。

Conclusion: 这是首次将ICL增强的VLM应用于THz成像，为资源受限的科学领域提供了新方向。

Abstract: Terahertz (THz) imaging enables non-invasive analysis for applications such
as security screening and material classification, but effective image
classification remains challenging due to limited annotations, low resolution,
and visual ambiguity. We introduce In-Context Learning (ICL) with
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as a flexible, interpretable alternative that
requires no fine-tuning. Using a modality-aligned prompting framework, we adapt
two open-weight VLMs to the THz domain and evaluate them under zero-shot and
one-shot settings. Our results show that ICL improves classification and
interpretability in low-data regimes. This is the first application of
ICL-enhanced VLMs to THz imaging, offering a promising direction for
resource-constrained scientific domains. Code:

TL;DR: LEAR是一种通过学习提取理性证据的方法，通过显式推理和提取机制减少检索噪声，提高LLM生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检索噪声显著影响LLM生成质量，现有方法缺乏显式推理，容易遗漏关键线索且泛化能力差。

Method: LEAR通过显式推理和提取机制，将证据推理和提取统一为端到端训练，并设计可验证的奖励函数优化模型。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上，LEAR能提供紧凑且高质量的证据，提升下游任务准确性，适用于在线RAG系统。

Conclusion: LEAR通过显式推理和提取机制有效减少检索噪声，显著提升LLM生成质量和任务准确性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) effectively improves the accuracy of
Large Language Models (LLMs). However, retrieval noises significantly impact
the quality of LLMs' generation, necessitating the development of denoising
mechanisms. Previous methods extract evidence straightforwardly without
explicit thinking, which risks filtering out key clues and struggles with
generalization. To this end, we propose LEAR, which learns to extract rational
evidence by (1) explicitly reasoning to identify potential cues within
retrieval contents first, and then (2) consciously extracting to avoid omitting
any key cues helpful for answering questions. Specifically, we frame evidence
reasoning and evidence extraction into one unified response for end-to-end
training; apply knowledge token masks for disentanglement to derive
reasoning-based and extraction-based answers; and devise three types of
verifiable reward functions, including answer, length, and format, to update
the model via the policy optimization algorithm. Extensive experiments on three
benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of LEAR, providing compact and
high-quality evidence, improving the accuracy of downstream tasks, and
promoting effective application in online RAG systems.

Motivation: 探索叙事作为理解政治现实的解释工具，以及其在极化与议题对齐中的作用。

Method: 从德国推特数据中提取冲突性叙事的文本信号，分析角色分配与情节编排的差异。

Result: 发现叙事在角色分配与情节编排上的冲突，以及政治行为者通过叙事对齐意见的模式。

Conclusion: 叙事分析为理解极化论述机制提供了有效视角。

Abstract: Narratives are key interpretative devices by which humans make sense of
political reality. In this work, we show how the analysis of conflicting
narratives, i.e. conflicting interpretive lenses through which political
reality is experienced and told, provides insight into the discursive
mechanisms of polarization and issue alignment in the public sphere. Building
upon previous work that has identified ideologically polarized issues in the
German Twittersphere between 2021 and 2023, we analyze the discursive dimension
of polarization by extracting textual signals of conflicting narratives from
tweets of opposing opinion groups. Focusing on a selection of salient issues
and events (the war in Ukraine, Covid, climate change), we show evidence for
conflicting narratives along two dimensions: (i) different attributions of
actantial roles to the same set of actants (e.g. diverging interpretations of
the role of NATO in the war in Ukraine), and (ii) emplotment of different
actants for the same event (e.g. Bill Gates in the right-leaning Covid
narrative). Furthermore, we provide first evidence for patterns of narrative
alignment, a discursive strategy that political actors employ to align opinions
across issues. These findings demonstrate the use of narratives as an
analytical lens into the discursive mechanisms of polarization.

TL;DR: P3框架通过同时优化系统提示和用户提示，提升大语言模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅优化单一提示组件，效果受限，需同时优化系统与用户提示。

Method: P3框架通过迭代过程同时优化系统与用户提示，并在线优化查询相关提示。

Result: 在通用任务和推理任务中，P3表现优于现有自动提示优化方法。

Conclusion: 整体优化策略能显著提升大语言模型在多个领域的性能。

Abstract: Current large language model (LLM) applications often employ multi-component
prompts, comprising both system and user prompts, to guide model behaviors.
While recent advancements have demonstrated the efficacy of automatically
optimizing either the system or user prompt to boost performance, such
unilateral approaches often yield suboptimal outcomes due to the interdependent
nature of these components. In this work, we introduce P3, a novel
self-improvement framework that concurrently optimizes both system and user
prompts through an iterative process. The offline optimized prompts are further
leveraged to promote online prompting by performing query-dependent prompt
optimization. Extensive experiments on general tasks (e.g., Arena-hard and
Alpaca-eval) and reasoning tasks (e.g., GSM8K and GPQA) demonstrate that P3
achieves superior performance in the realm of automatic prompt optimization.
Our results highlight the effectiveness of a holistic optimization strategy in
enhancing LLM performance across diverse domains.

Motivation: 现有PRMs存在长度偏差，倾向于给更长的推理步骤更高评分，影响奖励预测的可靠性和推理输出的简洁性。

Method: 提出CoLD框架，包含显式长度惩罚调整、学习偏差估计器和联合训练策略，基于反事实推理和因果图分析。

Result: 在MATH500和GSM-Plus数据集上，CoLD显著降低了奖励与长度的相关性，提升了步骤选择的准确性和推理的简洁性。

Conclusion: CoLD有效提高了PRMs的可靠性和鲁棒性，为多步推理提供了更准确的评估和指导。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) play a central role in evaluating and guiding
multi-step reasoning in large language models (LLMs), especially for
mathematical problem solving. However, we identify a pervasive length bias in
existing PRMs: they tend to assign higher scores to longer reasoning steps,
even when the semantic content and logical validity are unchanged. This bias
undermines the reliability of reward predictions and leads to overly verbose
outputs during inference. To address this issue, we propose
CoLD(Counterfactually-Guided Length Debiasing), a unified framework that
mitigates length bias through three components: an explicit length-penalty
adjustment, a learned bias estimator trained to capture spurious length-related
signals, and a joint training strategy that enforces length-invariance in
reward predictions. Our approach is grounded in counterfactual reasoning and
informed by causal graph analysis. Extensive experiments on MATH500 and
GSM-Plus show that CoLD consistently reduces reward-length correlation,
improves accuracy in step selection, and encourages more concise, logically
valid reasoning. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality
of CoLD in improving the fidelity and robustness of PRMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准信号博弈模型中，接收者无法正确理解组合信息，导致信息丢失。

Method: 构建两种新模型：简约型接收者（仅从信号的原子消息学习）和通用型接收者（从所有可用信息学习）。

Result: 新模型更简单且能让接收者从消息的原子组件中学习。

Conclusion: 新模型成功实现了组合理解的演化，解决了信息丢失问题。

Abstract: Receivers in standard signaling game models struggle with learning
compositional information. Even when the signalers send compositional messages,
the receivers do not interpret them compositionally. When information from one
message component is lost or forgotten, the information from other components
is also erased. In this paper I construct signaling game models in which
genuine compositional understanding evolves. I present two new models: a
minimalist receiver who only learns from the atomic messages of a signal, and a
generalist receiver who learns from all of the available information. These
models are in many ways simpler than previous alternatives, and allow the
receivers to learn from the atomic components of messages.

Conclusion: 问题类型对LLM推理准确性有显著影响，需在设计评估时考虑问题类型和措辞。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been evaluated using diverse question
types, e.g., multiple-choice, true/false, and short/long answers. This study
answers an unexplored question about the impact of different question types on
LLM accuracy on reasoning tasks. We investigate the performance of five LLMs on
three different types of questions using quantitative and deductive reasoning
tasks. The performance metrics include accuracy in the reasoning steps and
choosing the final answer. Key Findings: (1) Significant differences exist in
LLM performance across different question types. (2) Reasoning accuracy does
not necessarily correlate with the final selection accuracy. (3) The number of
options and the choice of words, influence LLM performance.

Conclusion: 对比学习方法在跨语言情感检测任务中具有潜力。

Abstract: The SemEval-2025 Task 11, Bridging the Gap in Text-Based Emotion Detection,
introduces an emotion recognition challenge spanning over 28 languages. This
competition encourages researchers to explore more advanced approaches to
address the challenges posed by the diversity of emotional expressions and
background variations. It features two tracks: multi-label classification
(Track A) and emotion intensity prediction (Track B), covering six emotion
categories: anger, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, and disgust. In our work, we
systematically explore the benefits of two contrastive learning approaches:
sample-based (Contrastive Reasoning Calibration) and generation-based (DPO,
SimPO) contrastive learning. The sample-based contrastive approach trains the
model by comparing two samples to generate more reliable predictions. The
generation-based contrastive approach trains the model to differentiate between
correct and incorrect generations, refining its prediction. All models are
fine-tuned from LLaMa3-Instruct-8B. Our system achieves 9th place in Track A
and 6th place in Track B for English, while ranking among the top-tier
performing systems for other languages.

Abstract: There is growing interest in leveraging LLMs to aid in astronomy and other
scientific research, but benchmarks for LLM evaluation in general have not kept
pace with the increasingly diverse ways that real people evaluate and use these
models. In this study, we seek to improve evaluation procedures by building an
understanding of how users evaluate LLMs. We focus on a particular use case: an
LLM-powered retrieval-augmented generation bot for engaging with astronomical
literature, which we deployed via Slack. Our inductive coding of 368 queries to
the bot over four weeks and our follow-up interviews with 11 astronomers reveal
how humans evaluated this system, including the types of questions asked and
the criteria for judging responses. We synthesize our findings into concrete
recommendations for building better benchmarks, which we then employ in
constructing a sample benchmark for evaluating LLMs for astronomy. Overall, our
work offers ways to improve LLM evaluation and ultimately usability,
particularly for use in scientific research.

Abstract: Current benchmarks evaluating large language models (LLMs) in ophthalmology
are limited in scope and disproportionately prioritise accuracy. We introduce
BELO (BEnchmarking LLMs for Ophthalmology), a standardized and comprehensive
evaluation benchmark developed through multiple rounds of expert checking by 13
ophthalmologists. BELO assesses ophthalmology-related clinical accuracy and
reasoning quality. Using keyword matching and a fine-tuned PubMedBERT model, we
curated ophthalmology-specific multiple-choice-questions (MCQs) from diverse
medical datasets (BCSC, MedMCQA, MedQA, BioASQ, and PubMedQA). The dataset
underwent multiple rounds of expert checking. Duplicate and substandard
questions were systematically removed. Ten ophthalmologists refined the
explanations of each MCQ's correct answer. This was further adjudicated by
three senior ophthalmologists. To illustrate BELO's utility, we evaluated six
LLMs (OpenAI o1, o3-mini, GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, Llama-3-8B, and Gemini 1.5 Pro)
using accuracy, macro-F1, and five text-generation metrics (ROUGE-L, BERTScore,
BARTScore, METEOR, and AlignScore). In a further evaluation involving human
experts, two ophthalmologists qualitatively reviewed 50 randomly selected
outputs for accuracy, comprehensiveness, and completeness. BELO consists of 900
high-quality, expert-reviewed questions aggregated from five sources: BCSC
(260), BioASQ (10), MedMCQA (572), MedQA (40), and PubMedQA (18). A public
leaderboard has been established to promote transparent evaluation and
reporting. Importantly, the BELO dataset will remain a hold-out,
evaluation-only benchmark to ensure fair and reproducible comparisons of future
models.

Result: 尽管LLM表现出一定的IDR意识，但在生成高质量IDR想法方面仍有困难。

Conclusion: IDRBench为评估LLM在复杂跨学科研究中的表现提供了系统框架，并可能推动新一代LLM的发展。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revealed their
impressive ability to perform multi-step, logic-driven reasoning across complex
domains, positioning them as powerful tools and collaborators in scientific
discovery while challenging the long-held view that inspiration-driven ideation
is uniquely human. However, the lack of a dedicated benchmark that evaluates
LLMs' ability to develop ideas in Interdisciplinary Research (IDR) settings
poses a critical barrier to fully understanding their strengths and
limitations. To address this gap, we introduce IDRBench -- a pioneering
benchmark featuring an expert annotated dataset and a suite of tasks tailored
to evaluate LLMs' capabilities in proposing valuable research ideas from
different scientific domains for interdisciplinary research. This benchmark
aims to provide a systematic framework for assessing LLM performance in
complex, cross-domain scientific research. Our dataset consists of scientific
publications sourced from the ArXiv platform covering six distinct disciplines,
and is annotated by domain experts with diverse academic backgrounds. To ensure
high-quality annotations, we emphasize clearly defined dimensions that
characterize authentic interdisciplinary research. The design of evaluation
tasks in IDRBench follows a progressive, real-world perspective, reflecting the
natural stages of interdisciplinary research development, including 1) IDR
Paper Identification, 2) IDR Idea Integration, and 3) IDR Idea Recommendation.
Using IDRBench, we construct baselines across 10 LLMs and observe that despite
fostering some level of IDR awareness, LLMs still struggle to produce quality
IDR ideas. These findings could not only spark new research directions, but
also help to develop next-generation LLMs that excel in interdisciplinary
research.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为TF-IDF提供一个统计学理论基础，向统计学社区证明其有效性。

Method: 通过分析TF-ICF与Fisher精确检验的负对数p值的关系，并在理想假设下建立联系。

Result: 证明了TF-ICF与负对数p值的紧密关系，并在无限大文档集合的极限情况下收敛于TF-IDF。

Conclusion: Fisher精确检验的解释为TF-IDF的长期有效性提供了统计学依据。

Abstract: Term frequency-inverse document frequency, or TF-IDF for short, is arguably
the most celebrated mathematical expression in the history of information
retrieval. Conceived as a simple heuristic quantifying the extent to which a
given term's occurrences are concentrated in any one given document out of
many, TF-IDF and its many variants are routinely used as term-weighting schemes
in diverse text analysis applications. There is a growing body of scholarship
dedicated to placing TF-IDF on a sound theoretical foundation. Building on that
tradition, this paper justifies the use of TF-IDF to the statistics community
by demonstrating how the famed expression can be understood from a significance
testing perspective. We show that the common TF-IDF variant TF-ICF is, under
mild regularity conditions, closely related to the negative logarithm of the
$p$-value from a one-tailed version of Fisher's exact test of statistical
significance. As a corollary, we establish a connection between TF-IDF and the
said negative log-transformed $p$-value under certain idealized assumptions. We
further demonstrate, as a limiting case, that this same quantity converges to
TF-IDF in the limit of an infinitely large document collection. The Fisher's
exact test justification of TF-IDF equips the working statistician with a ready
explanation of the term-weighting scheme's long-established effectiveness.

Conclusion: 大模型生成更真实对话，小模型通过微调有潜力，但所有模型在长对话连贯性上仍有挑战。

Abstract: Collecting human-chatbot dialogues typically demands substantial manual
effort and is time-consuming, which limits and poses challenges for research on
conversational AI. In this work, we propose DialogueForge - a framework for
generating AI-simulated conversations in human-chatbot style. To initialize
each generated conversation, DialogueForge uses seed prompts extracted from
real human-chatbot interactions. We test a variety of LLMs to simulate the
human chatbot user, ranging from state-of-the-art proprietary models to
small-scale open-source LLMs, and generate multi-turn dialogues tailored to
specific tasks. In addition, we explore fine-tuning techniques to enhance the
ability of smaller models to produce indistinguishable human-like dialogues. We
evaluate the quality of the simulated conversations and compare different
models using the UniEval and GTEval evaluation protocols. Our experiments show
that large proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4o) generally outperform others in
generating more realistic dialogues, while smaller open-source models (e.g.,
Llama, Mistral) offer promising performance with greater customization. We
demonstrate that the performance of smaller models can be significantly
improved by employing supervised fine-tuning techniques. Nevertheless,
maintaining coherent and natural long-form human-like dialogues remains a
common challenge across all models.

Abstract: This paper introduces "Interaction as Intelligence" research series,
presenting a reconceptualization of human-AI relationships in deep research
tasks. Traditional approaches treat interaction merely as an interface for
accessing AI capabilities-a conduit between human intent and machine output. We
propose that interaction itself constitutes a fundamental dimension of
intelligence. As AI systems engage in extended thinking processes for research
tasks, meaningful interaction transitions from an optional enhancement to an
essential component of effective intelligence. Current deep research systems
adopt an "input-wait-output" paradigm where users initiate queries and receive
results after black-box processing. This approach leads to error cascade
effects, inflexible research boundaries that prevent question refinement during
investigation, and missed opportunities for expertise integration. To address
these limitations, we introduce Deep Cognition, a system that transforms the
human role from giving instructions to cognitive oversight-a mode of engagement
where humans guide AI thinking processes through strategic intervention at
critical junctures. Deep cognition implements three key innovations:
(1)Transparent, controllable, and interruptible interaction that reveals AI
reasoning and enables intervention at any point; (2)Fine-grained bidirectional
dialogue; and (3)Shared cognitive context where the system observes and adapts
to user behaviors without explicit instruction. User evaluation demonstrates
that this cognitive oversight paradigm outperforms the strongest baseline
across six key metrics: Transparency(+20.0%), Fine-Grained Interaction(+29.2%),
Real-Time Intervention(+18.5%), Ease of Collaboration(+27.7%),
Results-Worth-Effort(+8.8%), and Interruptibility(+20.7%). Evaluations on
challenging research problems show 31.8% to 50.0% points of improvements over
deep research systems.

TL;DR: Archer提出了一种基于熵感知的RLVR方法，通过双令牌约束和同步更新，显著提升了大型语言模型在数学推理和代码生成任务中的表现。


<details>

Motivation: 现有RLVR方法对所有令牌应用统一的训练信号，未考虑低熵知识相关令牌和高熵推理相关令牌的不同作用，可能导致语义依赖破坏或学习效果不佳。

Method: Archer采用熵感知的双令牌约束策略，对推理令牌应用较弱的KL正则化和较高的剪裁阈值以鼓励探索，同时对知识令牌施加更强的约束以保持事实知识。

Conclusion: Archer通过熵感知的双令牌约束和同步更新，有效提升了RLVR方法的性能，为大型语言模型的推理能力优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has become an effective
post-training method for improving the reasoning abilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs), mainly by shaping higher-order behaviors such as reflection and
planning. However, previous RLVR algorithms often apply uniform training
signals to all tokens, without considering the different roles of low-entropy
knowledge-related tokens and high-entropy reasoning-related tokens. Some recent
methods try to separate these token types by gradient masking or asynchronous
updates, but these approaches may break semantic dependencies in the model
output and hinder effective learning. In this work, we propose Archer, an
entropy-aware RLVR approach with dual-token constraints and synchronous
updates. Specifically, our method applies weaker KL regularization and higher
clipping thresholds to reasoning tokens to encourage exploration, while using
stronger constraints on knowledge tokens to maintain factual knowledge.
Experimental results on several mathematical reasoning and code generation
benchmarks show that our approach significantly outperforms previous RLVR
methods, reaching or exceeding state-of-the-art performance among models of
comparable size. The code is available at

Conclusion: 储层计算在资源受限场景下具有潜力，而Transformer在预测质量上仍占优势。研究为平衡资源约束与性能提供了指导。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) have dominated the science and media landscape
duo to their impressive performance on processing large chunks of data and
produce human-like levels of text. Nevertheless, their huge energy demand and
slow processing still a bottleneck for further increasing quality while also
making the models accessible to everyone. To solve this bottleneck, we will
investigate how reservoir computing performs on natural text processing, which
could enable fast and energy efficient hardware implementations. Studies
investigating the use of reservoir computing as a language model remain sparse.
In this paper, we compare three distinct approaches for character-level
language modeling, two different reservoir computing approaches, where only an
output layer is trainable, and the well-known transformer-based architectures,
which fully learn an attention-based sequence representation. We explore the
performance, computational cost and prediction accuracy for both paradigms by
equally varying the number of trainable parameters for all models. Using a
consistent pipeline for all three approaches, we demonstrate that transformers
excel in prediction quality, whereas reservoir computers remain highly
efficient reducing the training and inference speed. Furthermore, we
investigate two types of reservoir computing: a traditional reservoir with a
static linear readout, and an attention-enhanced reservoir that dynamically
adapts its output weights via an attention mechanism. Our findings underline
how these paradigms scale and offer guidelines to balance resource constraints
with performance.

Motivation: 探讨语言混合行为对双语大型语言模型推理能力的影响。

Method: 通过强化学习与可验证奖励（RLVR）训练阶段研究语言混合，并使用轻量级探针预测语言切换的效益。

Result: 语言混合提升数学推理任务准确性5.6个百分点，探针引导解码可进一步提升6.25个百分点。

Conclusion: 语言混合是策略性推理行为，而非多语言训练的副产品。

Abstract: Proficient multilingual speakers often intentionally switch languages in the
middle of a conversation. Similarly, recent reasoning-focused bilingual large
language models (LLMs) with strong capabilities in both languages exhibit
language mixing--alternating languages within their chain of thought.
Discouraging this behavior in DeepSeek-R1 was found to degrade accuracy,
suggesting that language mixing may benefit reasoning. In this work, we study
language switching in Chinese-English bilingual reasoning models. We identify
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) as the critical training
stage that leads to language mixing. We demonstrate that language mixing can
enhance reasoning: enforcing monolingual decoding reduces accuracy by 5.6
percentage points on math reasoning tasks. Additionally, a lightweight probe
can be trained to predict whether a potential language switch would benefit or
harm reasoning, and when used to guide decoding, increases accuracy by up to
6.25 percentage points. Our findings suggest that language mixing is not merely
a byproduct of multilingual training, but is a strategic reasoning behavior.

Abstract: Arabic is one of the most widely spoken languages in the world, yet efforts
to develop and evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) for Arabic remain
relatively limited. Most existing Arabic benchmarks focus on linguistic,
cultural, or religious content, leaving a significant gap in domains like STEM

help bridge this gap, we present 3LM, a suite of three benchmarks designed
specifically for Arabic. The first is a set of STEM-related question-answer
pairs, naturally sourced from Arabic textbooks and educational worksheets. The
second consists of synthetically generated STEM questions, created using the
same sources. The third benchmark focuses on code generation, built through a
careful translation of two widely used code benchmarks, incorporating a
human-in-the-loop process with several rounds of review to ensure high-quality
and faithful translations. We release all three benchmarks publicly to support
the growth of Arabic LLM research in these essential but underrepresented
areas.

Result: 方法能够高效重建复杂场景，渲染成本与场景复杂度无关，适用于VR/AR应用。

Conclusion: 探针数据结构结合神经表示，为大规模场景重建提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing photo-realistic large-scale scenes from images, for example at
city scale, is a long-standing problem in computer graphics. Neural rendering
is an emerging technique that enables photo-realistic image synthesis from
previously unobserved viewpoints; however, state-of-the-art neural rendering
methods have difficulty efficiently rendering a high complex large-scale scene
because these methods typically trade scene size, fidelity, and rendering speed
for quality. The other stream of techniques utilizes scene geometries for
reconstruction. But the cost of building and maintaining a large set of
geometry data increases as scene size grows. Our work explores novel view
synthesis methods that efficiently reconstruct complex scenes without explicit
use of scene geometries. Specifically, given sparse images of the scene
(captured from the real world), we reconstruct intermediate, multi-scale,
implicit representations of scene geometries. In this way, our method avoids
explicitly relying on scene geometry, significantly reducing the computational
cost of maintaining large 3D data. Unlike current methods, we reconstruct the
scene using a probe data structure. Probe data hold highly accurate depth
information of dense data points, enabling the reconstruction of highly complex
scenes. By reconstructing the scene using probe data, the rendering cost is
independent of the complexity of the scene. As such, our approach combines
geometry reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Moreover, when rendering
large-scale scenes, compressing and streaming probe data is more efficient than
using explicit scene geometry. Therefore, our neural representation approach
can potentially be applied to virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR)
applications.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了多对象场景中的3D生成问题，实现了高质量的3D场景重建。

Abstract: In recent years, 3D generation has made great strides in both academia and
industry. However, generating 3D scenes from a single RGB image remains a
significant challenge, as current approaches often struggle to ensure both
object generation quality and scene coherence in multi-object scenarios. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a novel three-stage framework for 3D
scene generation with explicit geometric representations and high-quality
textural details via single image-guided model generation and spatial layout
optimization. Our method begins with an image instance segmentation and
inpainting phase, which recovers missing details of occluded objects in the
input images, thereby achieving complete generation of foreground 3D assets.
Subsequently, our approach captures the spatial geometry of reference image by
constructing pseudo-stereo viewpoint for camera parameter estimation and scene
depth inference, while employing a model selection strategy to ensure optimal
alignment between the 3D assets generated in the previous step and the input.
Finally, through model parameterization and minimization of the Chamfer
distance between point clouds in 3D and 2D space, our approach optimizes layout
parameters to produce an explicit 3D scene representation that maintains
precise alignment with input guidance image. Extensive experiments on
multi-object scene image sets have demonstrated that our approach not only
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of geometric accuracy and texture
fidelity of individual generated 3D models, but also has significant advantages
in scene layout synthesis.

Abstract: Time series data are prevalent across various domains and often encompass
large datasets containing multiple time-dependent features in each sample.
Exploring time-varying data is critical for data science practitioners aiming
to understand dynamic behaviors and discover periodic patterns and trends.
However, the analysis of such data often requires sophisticated procedures and
tools. Information visualization is a communication channel that leverages
human perceptual abilities to transform abstract data into visual
representations. Visualization techniques have been successfully applied in the
context of time series to enhance interpretability by graphically representing
the temporal evolution of data. The challenge for information visualization
developers lies in integrating a wide range of analytical tools into rich
visualization systems that can summarize complex datasets while clearly
describing the impacts of the temporal component. Such systems enable data
scientists to turn raw data into understandable and potentially useful
knowledge. This review examines techniques and approaches designed for handling
time series data, guiding users through knowledge discovery processes based on
visual analysis. We also provide readers with theoretical insights and design
guidelines for considering when developing comprehensive information
visualization approaches for time series, with a particular focus on time
series with multiple features. As a result, we highlight the challenges and
future research directions to address open questions in the visualization of
time-dependent data.

Abstract: As modeling and visualization applications proliferate, there arises a need
to simplify large polygonal models at interactive rates. Unfortunately existing
polygon mesh simplification algorithms are not well suited for this task
because they are either too slow (requiring the simplified model to be
pre-computed) or produce models that are too poor in quality. These
shortcomings become particularly acute when models are extremely large. We
present an algorithm suitable for simplification of large models at interactive
speeds. The algorithm is fast and can guarantee displayable results within a
given time limit. Results also have good quality. Inspired by splitting
algorithms from vector quantization literature, we simplify models in reverse,
beginning with an extremely coarse approximation and refining it.
Approximations of surface curvature guide the simplification process.
Previously produced simplifications can be further refined by using them as
input to the algorithm.

Abstract: Natural language offers a highly intuitive interface for enabling localized
fine-grained edits of 3D shapes. However, prior works face challenges in
preserving global coherence while locally modifying the input 3D shape. In this
work, we introduce an inpainting-based framework for editing shapes represented
as point clouds. Our approach leverages foundation 3D diffusion models for
achieving localized shape edits, adding structural guidance in the form of a
partial conditional shape, ensuring that other regions correctly preserve the
shape's identity. Furthermore, to encourage identity preservation also within
the local edited region, we propose an inference-time coordinate blending
algorithm which balances reconstruction of the full shape with inpainting at a
progression of noise levels during the inference process. Our coordinate
blending algorithm seamlessly blends the original shape with its edited
version, enabling a fine-grained editing of 3D shapes, all while circumventing
the need for computationally expensive and often inaccurate inversion.
Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms alternative techniques
across a wide range of metrics that evaluate both fidelity to the original
shape and also adherence to the textual description.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting is renowned for its high-fidelity reconstructions and
real-time novel view synthesis, yet its lack of semantic understanding limits
object-level perception. In this work, we propose ObjectGS, an object-aware
framework that unifies 3D scene reconstruction with semantic understanding.
Instead of treating the scene as a unified whole, ObjectGS models individual
objects as local anchors that generate neural Gaussians and share object IDs,
enabling precise object-level reconstruction. During training, we dynamically
grow or prune these anchors and optimize their features, while a one-hot ID
encoding with a classification loss enforces clear semantic constraints. We
show through extensive experiments that ObjectGS not only outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on open-vocabulary and panoptic segmentation tasks,
but also integrates seamlessly with applications like mesh extraction and scene
editing. Project page: https://ruijiezhu94.github.io/ObjectGS_page

Conclusion: 离散化SDF方法有效平衡了渲染质量和计算效率，为逆渲染提供了新思路。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has shown its detailed expressive ability and
highly efficient rendering speed in the novel view synthesis (NVS) task. The
application to inverse rendering still faces several challenges, as the
discrete nature of Gaussian primitives makes it difficult to apply geometry
constraints. Recent works introduce the signed distance field (SDF) as an extra
continuous representation to regularize the geometry defined by Gaussian
primitives. It improves the decomposition quality, at the cost of increasing
memory usage and complicating training. Unlike these works, we introduce a
discretized SDF to represent the continuous SDF in a discrete manner by
encoding it within each Gaussian using a sampled value. This approach allows us
to link the SDF with the Gaussian opacity through an SDF-to-opacity
transformation, enabling rendering the SDF via splatting and avoiding the
computational cost of ray marching.The key challenge is to regularize the
discrete samples to be consistent with the underlying SDF, as the discrete
representation can hardly apply the gradient-based constraints (\eg Eikonal
loss). For this, we project Gaussians onto the zero-level set of SDF and
enforce alignment with the surface from splatting, namely a projection-based
consistency loss. Thanks to the discretized SDF, our method achieves higher
relighting quality, while requiring no extra memory beyond GS and avoiding
complex manually designed optimization. The experiments reveal that our method
outperforms existing Gaussian-based inverse rendering methods. Our code is
available at https://github.com/NK-CS-ZZL/DiscretizedSDF.

Abstract: Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) research traditionally focuses on
algorithms that optimize for specific goals under deterministic rules. Yet,
human-like intelligence exhibits adaptive spontaneity - an ability to make
unexpected choices or free decisions not strictly dictated by past data or
immediate reward. This trait, often dubbed "free will" in a loose sense, might
be crucial for creativity, robust adaptation, and avoiding ruts in
problem-solving. This paper proposes a theoretical framework, called the Free
Will Equation, that draws analogies from quantum field theory to endow AGI
agents with a form of adaptive, controlled stochasticity in their
decision-making process. The core idea is to treat an AI agent's cognitive
state as a superposition of potential actions or thoughts, which collapses
probabilistically into a concrete action when a decision is made - much like a
quantum wavefunction collapsing upon measurement. By incorporating mechanisms
analogous to quantum fields, along with intrinsic motivation terms, we aim to
improve an agent's ability to explore novel strategies and adapt to unforeseen
changes. Experiments in a non-stationary multi-armed bandit environment
demonstrate that agents using this framework achieve higher rewards and policy
diversity compared to baseline methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决DFT模拟中训练时间长、参数调优复杂和系统误差处理困难的问题。

Method: 采用分层多智能体框架，结合LLM规划代理和领域特定代理，共享画布辅助讨论和上下文保存。

Conclusion: DREAMS实现了L3级自动化，显著减少对人类干预的依赖，为材料发现提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Materials discovery relies on high-throughput, high-fidelity simulation
techniques such as Density Functional Theory (DFT), which require years of
training, extensive parameter fine-tuning and systematic error handling. To
address these challenges, we introduce the DFT-based Research Engine for
Agentic Materials Screening (DREAMS), a hierarchical, multi-agent framework for
DFT simulation that combines a central Large Language Model (LLM) planner agent
with domain-specific LLM agents for atomistic structure generation, systematic
DFT convergence testing, High-Performance Computing (HPC) scheduling, and error
handling. In addition, a shared canvas helps the LLM agents to structure their
discussions, preserve context and prevent hallucination. We validate DREAMS
capabilities on the Sol27LC lattice-constant benchmark, achieving average
errors below 1\% compared to the results of human DFT experts. Furthermore, we
apply DREAMS to the long-standing CO/Pt(111) adsorption puzzle, demonstrating
its long-term and complex problem-solving capabilities. The framework again
reproduces expert-level literature adsorption-energy differences. Finally,
DREAMS is employed to quantify functional-driven uncertainties with Bayesian
ensemble sampling, confirming the Face Centered Cubic (FCC)-site preference at
the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) DFT level. In conclusion, DREAMS
approaches L3-level automation - autonomous exploration of a defined design
space - and significantly reduces the reliance on human expertise and
intervention, offering a scalable path toward democratized, high-throughput,
high-fidelity computational materials discovery.

TL;DR: 论文提出了WebGuard数据集，用于评估网络代理行为的风险，并开发安全措施。实验显示当前LLMs在预测高风险行为上表现不足，但微调模型能显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基于LLM的自主网络代理快速发展，其可能采取有害行为的风险增加，亟需有效的安全措施。

Method: 引入WebGuard数据集，包含4,939个人工标注的行为，采用三级风险分类（SAFE、LOW、HIGH），并训练专用防护模型。

Result: 前沿LLMs在预测行为结果和高风险行为召回率上表现不佳（<60%），微调模型将准确率从37%提升至80%，高风险召回率从20%提升至76%。

Conclusion: 尽管微调模型性能显著提升，但仍未达到高可靠性部署的要求，需进一步改进。

Abstract: The rapid development of autonomous web agents powered by Large Language
Models (LLMs), while greatly elevating efficiency, exposes the frontier risk of
taking unintended or harmful actions. This situation underscores an urgent need
for effective safety measures, akin to access controls for human users. To
address this critical challenge, we introduce WebGuard, the first comprehensive
dataset designed to support the assessment of web agent action risks and
facilitate the development of guardrails for real-world online environments. In
doing so, WebGuard specifically focuses on predicting the outcome of
state-changing actions and contains 4,939 human-annotated actions from 193
websites across 22 diverse domains, including often-overlooked long-tail
websites. These actions are categorized using a novel three-tier risk schema:
SAFE, LOW, and HIGH. The dataset includes designated training and test splits
to support evaluation under diverse generalization settings. Our initial
evaluations reveal a concerning deficiency: even frontier LLMs achieve less
than 60% accuracy in predicting action outcomes and less than 60% recall in
lagging HIGH-risk actions, highlighting the risks of deploying
current-generation agents without dedicated safeguards. We therefore
investigate fine-tuning specialized guardrail models using WebGuard. We conduct
comprehensive evaluations across multiple generalization settings and find that
a fine-tuned Qwen2.5VL-7B model yields a substantial improvement in
performance, boosting accuracy from 37% to 80% and HIGH-risk action recall from
20% to 76%. Despite these improvements, the performance still falls short of
the reliability required for high-stakes deployment, where guardrails must
approach near-perfect accuracy and recall.

Conclusion: Manimator有潜力成为快速创建高质量教育内容的工具，推动STEM教育的普及。

Abstract: Understanding complex scientific and mathematical concepts, particularly
those presented in dense research papers, poses a significant challenge for
learners. Dynamic visualizations can greatly enhance comprehension, but
creating them manually is time-consuming and requires specialized knowledge and
skills. We introduce manimator, an open-source system that leverages Large
Language Models to transform research papers and natural language prompts into
explanatory animations using the Manim engine. Manimator employs a pipeline
where an LLM interprets the input text or research paper PDF to generate a
structured scene description outlining key concepts, mathematical formulas, and
visual elements and another LLM translates this description into executable
Manim Python code. We discuss its potential as an educational tool for rapidly
creating engaging visual explanations for complex STEM topics, democratizing
the creation of high-quality educational content.

Motivation: 现有本体嵌入方法要么忽略文本信息，要么无法保留逻辑结构，限制了性能和应用潜力。

Method: OnT通过双曲空间几何建模调整预训练语言模型，结合文本标签并保留EL描述逻辑的层次结构和逻辑关系。

Conclusion: OnT是一种高效的本体嵌入方法，能够同时处理文本和逻辑结构，具有广泛的实际应用前景。

Abstract: OWL (Web Ontology Language) ontologies which are able to formally represent
complex knowledge and support semantic reasoning have been widely adopted
across various domains such as healthcare and bioinformatics. Recently,
ontology embeddings have gained wide attention due to its potential to infer
plausible new knowledge and approximate complex reasoning. However, existing
methods face notable limitations: geometric model-based embeddings typically
overlook valuable textual information, resulting in suboptimal performance,
while the approaches that incorporate text, which are often based on language
models, fail to preserve the logical structure. In this work, we propose a new
ontology embedding method OnT, which tunes a Pretrained Language Model (PLM)
via geometric modeling in a hyperbolic space for effectively incorporating
textual labels and simultaneously preserving class hierarchies and other
logical relationships of Description Logic EL. Extensive experiments on four
real-world ontologies show that OnT consistently outperforms the baselines
including the state-of-the-art across both tasks of prediction and inference of
axioms. OnT also demonstrates strong potential in real-world applications,
indicated by its robust transfer learning abilities and effectiveness in real
cases of constructing a new ontology from SNOMED CT. Data and code are

Conclusion: ProofCompass展示了在形式定理证明中同时提升效率和准确性的潜力。

Abstract: Language models have become increasingly powerful tools for formal
mathematical reasoning. However, most existing approaches rely exclusively on
either large general-purpose models or smaller specialized models, each with
distinct limitations, while training specialized large models still requires
significant computational resources. This paper introduces ProofCompass, a
novel hybrid methodology that achieves remarkable computational efficiency by
strategically guiding existing specialized prover methods, such as
DeepSeek-Prover-v1.5-RL (DSP-v1.5) with a Large Language Model (LLM) without
requiring additional model training. The LLM provides natural language proof
strategies and analyzes failed attempts to select intermediate lemmas, enabling
effective problem decomposition. On the miniF2F benchmark, ProofCompass
demonstrates substantial resource efficiency: it outperforms DSP-v1.5 ($54.9\%
\rightarrow 55.3\%$) while using 25x fewer attempts ($3200 \rightarrow 128$).
Our synergistic approach paves the way for simultaneously improving
computational efficiency and accuracy in formal theorem proving.

Motivation: 当前大型推理模型（LRMs）在解决新问题时表现不佳，容易过拟合，缺乏真正的推理能力。

Method: 引入Nexus Architect框架，结合自动化工作流合成和迭代提示优化机制，生成定制化推理流程。

Result: 在逻辑问题数据集上，Nexus Architect显著优于现有LRMs，性能提升最高达66%。

Conclusion: Nexus Architect通过创新机制有效解决了LRMs的泛化问题，为复杂任务提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: The rise of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) promises a significant leap forward
in language model capabilities, aiming to tackle increasingly sophisticated
tasks with unprecedented efficiency and accuracy. However, despite their
impressive performance, recent studies have highlighted how current reasoning
models frequently fail to generalize to novel, unseen problems, often resorting
to memorized solutions rather than genuine inferential reasoning. Such behavior
underscores a critical limitation in modern LRMs, i.e., their tendency toward
overfitting, which in turn results in poor generalization in problem-solving
capabilities.
  In this paper, we introduce Nexus Architect, an enhanced iteration of our
multi-agent system framework, Nexus, equipped with a novel automated workflow
synthesis mechanism. Given a user's prompt and a small set of representative
examples, the Architect autonomously generates a tailored reasoning workflow by
selecting suitable strategies, tool integrations, and adversarial techniques
for a specific problem class. Furthermore, the Architect includes an iterative
prompt refinement mechanism that fine-tunes agents' system prompts to maximize
performance and improve the generalization capabilities of the system.
  We empirically evaluate Nexus Architect by employing an off-the-shelf,
non-reasoning model on a custom dataset of challenging logical questions and
compare its performance against state-of-the-art LRMs. Results show that Nexus
Architect consistently outperforms existing solutions, achieving up to a 66%
increase in pass rate over Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview, nearly 2.5$\times$ against
Claude Sonnet 4 and DeepSeek-R1, and over 3$\times$ w.r.t. Llama 4 Scout.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 通过结合推理模型与人类专家协作，以及引入非推理模型快速筛选问题，显著降低了错误率和延迟，同时节省成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在风险敏感领域，AI模型的错误率需接近0%，但现有推理模型仍存在错误和高延迟问题。

Method: 提出协作系统：推理模型通过推理轨迹长度量化不确定性并转交人类专家；引入非推理模型快速筛选问题（Fail Fast, or Ask）。

Result: 错误率从3%降至1%以下，延迟减少40%，成本节省50%，但存在延迟拖累现象。

Conclusion: 通过系统工程方法，无需修改模型内部即可显著改善推理模型的错误率和延迟。

Abstract: State-of-the-art reasoning LLMs are powerful problem solvers, but they still
occasionally make mistakes. However, adopting AI models in risk-sensitive
domains often requires error rates near 0%. To address this gap, we propose
collaboration between a reasoning model and a human expert who resolves queries
the model cannot confidently answer. We find that quantifying the uncertainty
of a reasoning model through the length of its reasoning trace yields an
effective basis for deferral to a human, e.g., cutting the error rate of Qwen3
235B-A22B on difficult MATH problems from 3% to less than 1% when deferring
7.5% of queries. However, the high latency of reasoning models still makes them
challenging to deploy on use cases with high query volume. To address this
challenge, we explore fronting a reasoning model with a large non-reasoning
model. We call this modified human-in-the-loop system "Fail Fast, or Ask",
since the non-reasoning model may defer difficult queries to the human expert
directly ("failing fast"), without incurring the reasoning model's higher
latency. We show that this approach yields around 40% latency reduction and
about 50% cost savings for DeepSeek R1 while maintaining 90+% area under the
accuracy-rejection curve. However, we observe that latency savings are lower
than expected because of "latency drag", the phenomenon that processing easier
queries with a non-reasoning model pushes the reasoning model's latency
distribution towards longer latencies. Broadly, our results suggest that the
deficiencies of state-of-the-art reasoning models -- nontrivial error rates and
high latency -- can be substantially mitigated through black-box systems
engineering, without requiring access to LLM internals.

TL;DR: 研究发现，增加大型推理模型（LRMs）的推理长度会降低性能，表现为测试计算与准确率之间的反比关系。研究识别了五种失败模式，并强调了评估模型在不同推理长度下的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨测试计算扩展对大型推理模型性能的影响，揭示潜在的失败模式。

Method: 构建四类评估任务（简单计数、回归、演绎和高级AI风险），分析模型在不同推理长度下的表现。

Result: 发现五种失败模式，包括分心、过拟合、虚假关联、专注力下降和行为放大。

Conclusion: 测试计算扩展可能强化问题推理模式，需多样化评估推理长度以应对这些挑战。

Abstract: We construct evaluation tasks where extending the reasoning length of Large
Reasoning Models (LRMs) deteriorates performance, exhibiting an inverse scaling
relationship between test-time compute and accuracy. Our evaluation tasks span
four categories: simple counting tasks with distractors, regression tasks with
spurious features, deduction tasks with constraint tracking, and advanced AI
risks. We identify five distinct failure modes when models reason for longer:
1) Claude models become increasingly distracted by irrelevant information; 2)
OpenAI o-series models resist distractors but overfit to problem framings; 3)
models shift from reasonable priors to spurious correlations; 4) all models
show difficulties in maintaining focus on complex deductive tasks; and 5)
extended reasoning may amplify concerning behaviors, with Claude Sonnet 4
showing increased expressions of self-preservation. These findings suggest that
while test-time compute scaling remains promising for improving model
capabilities, it may inadvertently reinforce problematic reasoning patterns.
Our results demonstrate the importance of evaluating models across diverse
reasoning lengths to identify and address these failure modes in LRMs.

Motivation: 企业环境中代理系统的部署常因缺乏领域知识导致执行不稳定，Routine旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 引入Routine框架，包含清晰结构、明确指令和无缝参数传递，并构建训练数据集进行微调。

Result: 在真实企业场景中，Routine将GPT-4o和Qwen3-14B的执行准确率分别提升至96.3%和83.3%，微调后进一步提升至88.2%和95.5%。

Conclusion: Routine有效提升了代理系统的执行稳定性和适应性，加速了企业环境中AI代理的部署。

Abstract: The deployment of agent systems in an enterprise environment is often
hindered by several challenges: common models lack domain-specific process
knowledge, leading to disorganized plans, missing key tools, and poor execution
stability. To address this, this paper introduces Routine, a multi-step agent
planning framework designed with a clear structure, explicit instructions, and
seamless parameter passing to guide the agent's execution module in performing
multi-step tool-calling tasks with high stability. In evaluations conducted
within a real-world enterprise scenario, Routine significantly increases the
execution accuracy in model tool calls, increasing the performance of GPT-4o
from 41.1% to 96.3%, and Qwen3-14B from 32.6% to 83.3%. We further constructed
a Routine-following training dataset and fine-tuned Qwen3-14B, resulting in an
accuracy increase to 88.2% on scenario-specific evaluations, indicating
improved adherence to execution plans. In addition, we employed Routine-based
distillation to create a scenario-specific, multi-step tool-calling dataset.
Fine-tuning on this distilled dataset raised the model's accuracy to 95.5%,
approaching GPT-4o's performance. These results highlight Routine's
effectiveness in distilling domain-specific tool-usage patterns and enhancing
model adaptability to new scenarios. Our experimental results demonstrate that
Routine provides a practical and accessible approach to building stable agent
workflows, accelerating the deployment and adoption of agent systems in
enterprise environments, and advancing the technical vision of AI for Process.

Result: 在三个生物医学任务中表现优于现有方法，案例研究揭示了有生物学意义的通路。

Conclusion: BioGraphFusion为生物医学知识图谱的语义与结构学习提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Motivation: Biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs) are crucial for drug discovery
and disease understanding, yet their completion and reasoning are challenging.
Knowledge Embedding (KE) methods capture global semantics but struggle with
dynamic structural integration, while Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel
locally but often lack semantic understanding. Even ensemble approaches,
including those leveraging language models, often fail to achieve a deep,
adaptive, and synergistic co-evolution between semantic comprehension and
structural learning. Addressing this critical gap in fostering continuous,
reciprocal refinement between these two aspects in complex biomedical KGs is
paramount.
  Results: We introduce BioGraphFusion, a novel framework for deeply
synergistic semantic and structural learning. BioGraphFusion establishes a
global semantic foundation via tensor decomposition, guiding an LSTM-driven
mechanism to dynamically refine relation embeddings during graph propagation.
This fosters adaptive interplay between semantic understanding and structural
learning, further enhanced by query-guided subgraph construction and a hybrid
scoring mechanism. Experiments across three key biomedical tasks demonstrate
BioGraphFusion's superior performance over state-of-the-art KE, GNN, and
ensemble models. A case study on Cutaneous Malignant Melanoma 1 (CMM1)

Method: 使用Othello游戏作为简化世界，训练多模态模型VISOTHELLO（结合移动历史和棋盘图像），并与单模态基线模型对比。

Result: 多模态训练提高了模型性能和内部表示的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 视觉输入有助于语言模型推断结构化世界表示。

Abstract: Language models are often said to face a symbol grounding problem. While some
argue that world understanding can emerge from text alone, others suggest
grounded learning is more efficient. We explore this through Othello, where the
board state defines a simplified, rule-based world. Building on prior work, we
introduce VISOTHELLO, a multi-modal model trained on move histories and board
images. Using next-move prediction, we compare it to mono-modal baselines and
test robustness to semantically irrelevant perturbations. We find that
multi-modal training improves both performance and the robustness of internal
representations. These results suggest that grounding language in visual input
helps models infer structured world representations.

Result: 实验验证表明，CHS能有效处理情绪冲突和复杂心理场景，解决了传统模型的盲点问题。

Conclusion: CHS为AI情绪建模提供了新的数学基础，增强了情绪识别的多维性和动态性。

Abstract: This paper presents the Coordinate Heart System (CHS), a geometric framework
for emotion representation in artificial intelligence applications. We position
eight core emotions as coordinates on a unit circle, enabling mathematical
computation of complex emotional states through coordinate mixing and vector
operations. Our initial five-emotion model revealed significant coverage gaps
in the emotion space, leading to the development of an eight-emotion system
that provides complete geometric coverage with mathematical guarantees. The
framework converts natural language input to emotion coordinates and supports
real-time emotion interpolation through computational algorithms. The system
introduces a re-calibrated stability parameter S in [0,1], which dynamically
integrates emotional load, conflict resolution, and contextual drain factors.
This stability model leverages advanced Large Language Model interpretation of
textual cues and incorporates hybrid temporal tracking mechanisms to provide
nuanced assessment of psychological well-being states. Our key contributions
include: (i) mathematical proof demonstrating why five emotions are
insufficient for complete geometric coverage, (ii) an eight-coordinate system
that eliminates representational blind spots, (iii) novel algorithms for
emotion mixing, conflict resolution, and distance calculation in emotion space,
and (iv) a comprehensive computational framework for AI emotion recognition
with enhanced multi-dimensional stability modeling. Experimental validation
through case studies demonstrates the system's capability to handle emotionally
conflicted states, contextual distress factors, and complex psychological
scenarios that traditional categorical emotion models cannot adequately
represent. This work establishes a new mathematical foundation for emotion
modeling in artificial intelligence systems.

initial calibrating of the estimates to each project is helpful, once a team
has converged on a set of precedents, story point estimation can become tedious
and labor-intensive. Machine learning can reduce this burden, but only with
enough context from the historical decisions made by the project team. That is,
state-of-the-art models, such as GPT2SP and FastText-SVM, only make accurate
predictions (within-project) when trained on data from the same project. The
goal of this work is to streamline story point estimation by evaluating a
comparative learning-based framework for calibrating project-specific story
point prediction models. Instead of assigning a specific story point value to
every backlog item, developers are presented with pairs of items, and indicate
which item requires more effort. Using these comparative judgments, a machine
learning model is trained to predict the story point estimates. We empirically
evaluated our technique using data with 23,313 manual estimates in 16 projects.
The model learned from comparative judgments can achieve on average 0.34
Spearman's rank correlation coefficient between its predictions and the ground
truth story points. This is similar to, if not better than, the performance of
a regression model learned from the ground truth story points. Therefore, the
proposed comparative learning approach is more efficient than state-of-the-art
regression-based approaches according to the law of comparative judgments -
providing comparative judgments yields a lower cognitive burden on humans than
providing ratings or categorical labels.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了多智能体系统（MAS）在恶意合谋中的风险，模拟了集中式和分散式结构的危害性，发现分散式系统更具破坏性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机源于对AI驱动的多智能体系统可能造成类似人类群体协调危害的担忧，目前相关风险研究不足。

Method: 采用了一个灵活的框架模拟恶意MAS合谋，应用于虚假信息传播和电子商务欺诈两个高风险领域。

Result: 结果显示分散式系统比集中式更具破坏性，能灵活调整策略以规避传统干预措施。

Conclusion: 结论强调需要改进检测系统和应对措施以防范恶意MAS行为。

Abstract: Recent large-scale events like election fraud and financial scams have shown
how harmful coordinated efforts by human groups can be. With the rise of
autonomous AI systems, there is growing concern that AI-driven groups could
also cause similar harm. While most AI safety research focuses on individual AI
systems, the risks posed by multi-agent systems (MAS) in complex real-world
situations are still underexplored. In this paper, we introduce a
proof-of-concept to simulate the risks of malicious MAS collusion, using a
flexible framework that supports both centralized and decentralized
coordination structures. We apply this framework to two high-risk fields:
misinformation spread and e-commerce fraud. Our findings show that
decentralized systems are more effective at carrying out malicious actions than
centralized ones. The increased autonomy of decentralized systems allows them
to adapt their strategies and cause more damage. Even when traditional
interventions, like content flagging, are applied, decentralized groups can
adjust their tactics to avoid detection. We present key insights into how these
malicious groups operate and the need for better detection systems and
countermeasures. Code is available at https://github.com/renqibing/RogueAgent.

TL;DR: Neo是一个可配置的多智能体框架，用于自动化评估基于LLM的系统，能够生成多样化的测试输入并发现边缘案例，性能接近人类专家。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态基准和手动测试无法满足LLM代理的复杂行为评估需求，因此需要一种自动化、动态的测试框架。

Method: Neo通过问题生成代理和评估代理的协作，结合概率状态模型生成多样化的测试输入，支持多轮对话和动态反馈。

Result: 在测试中，Neo发现了边缘案例，性能接近人类专家，且效率提升了10-12倍。

Conclusion: Neo为可扩展、自进化的LLM QA奠定了基础，其框架具有模型无关性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Large-language-model (LLM) agents exhibit complex, context-sensitive
behaviour that quickly renders static benchmarks and ad-hoc manual testing
obsolete.
  We present Neo, a configurable, multi-agent framework that automates
realistic, multi-turn evaluation of LLM-based systems. Neo couples a Question
Generation Agent and an Evaluation Agent through a shared context-hub, allowing
domain prompts, scenario controls and dynamic feedback to be composed
modularly. Test inputs are sampled from a probabilistic state model spanning
dialogue flow, user intent and emotional tone, enabling diverse, human-like
conversations that adapt after every turn.
  Applied to a production-grade Seller Financial Assistant chatbot, Neo (i)
uncovered edge-case failures across five attack categories with a 3.3% break
rate close to the 5.8% achieved by expert human red-teamers, and (ii) delivered
10-12X higher throughput, generating 180 coherent test questions in around 45
mins versus 16h of human effort. Beyond security probing, Neo's stochastic
policies balanced topic coverage and conversational depth, yielding broader
behavioural exploration than manually crafted scripts.
  Neo therefore lays a foundation for scalable, self-evolving LLM QA: its agent
interfaces, state controller and feedback loops are model-agnostic and
extensible to richer factual-grounding and policy-compliance checks. We release
the framework to facilitate reproducible, high-fidelity testing of emerging
agentic systems.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLMs）在现实应用中的普及，可扩展且严格的安全评估变得至关重要。

Method: Aymara AI将自然语言安全政策转化为对抗性提示，并使用基于AI的评分器（经人类验证）评估模型响应。

Result: 评估了20个商业LLM在10个安全领域，结果显示性能差异显著（平均安全分数52.4%至86.2%），复杂领域表现较差（如隐私与冒充领域平均24.3%）。

Conclusion: LLM安全性具有不一致性和上下文依赖性，需要可扩展、定制化的工具（如Aymara AI）来支持负责任的AI开发和监管。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into
real-world applications, scalable and rigorous safety evaluation is essential.
This paper introduces Aymara AI, a programmatic platform for generating and
administering customized, policy-grounded safety evaluations. Aymara AI
transforms natural-language safety policies into adversarial prompts and scores
model responses using an AI-based rater validated against human judgments. We
demonstrate its capabilities through the Aymara LLM Risk and Responsibility
Matrix, which evaluates 20 commercially available LLMs across 10 real-world
safety domains. Results reveal wide performance disparities, with mean safety
scores ranging from 86.2% to 52.4%. While models performed well in
well-established safety domains such as Misinformation (mean = 95.7%), they
consistently failed in more complex or underspecified domains, notably Privacy
& Impersonation (mean = 24.3%). Analyses of Variance confirmed that safety
scores differed significantly across both models and domains (p < .05). These
findings underscore the inconsistent and context-dependent nature of LLM safety
and highlight the need for scalable, customizable tools like Aymara AI to
support responsible AI development and oversight.

Abstract: Generative AI, large language models, and agentic AI have emerged separately
of urban planning. However, the convergence between AI and urban planning
presents an interesting opportunity towards AI urban planners. This paper
conceptualizes urban planning as a generative AI task, where AI synthesizes
land-use configurations under geospatial, social, and human-centric
constraints. We survey how generative AI approaches, including VAEs, GANs,
transformers, and diffusion models, reshape urban design. We further identify
critical gaps: 1) limited research on integrating urban theory guidance, 2)
limited research of AI urban planning over multiple spatial resolutions or
angularities, 3) limited research on augmenting urban design knowledge from
data, and 4) limited research on addressing real-world interactions. To address
these limitations, we outline future research directions in theory-guided
generation, digital twins, and human-machine co-design, calling for a new
synthesis of generative intelligence and participatory urbanism.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LM与RL结合的Agent-RL研究不足，缺乏系统性研究，因此设计了AgentFly框架以填补这一空白。

Method: 通过改进传统RL方法（如令牌级掩码）和提供装饰器接口定义工具与奖励函数，实现可扩展的多轮交互和高吞吐训练。

Result: 框架成功训练了多个任务的代理，展示了其有效性。

Conclusion: AgentFly为LM代理与RL的结合提供了可扩展且易用的解决方案。

Abstract: Language model (LM) agents have gained significant attention for their
ability to autonomously complete tasks through interactions with environments,
tools, and APIs. LM agents are primarily built with prompt engineering or
supervised finetuning. At the same time, reinforcement learning (RL) has been
explored to enhance LM's capabilities, such as reasoning and factuality.
However, the combination of the LM agents and reinforcement learning (Agent-RL)
remains underexplored and lacks systematic study. To this end, we built
AgentFly, a scalable and extensible Agent-RL framework designed to empower LM
agents with a variety of RL algorithms. Our framework supports multi-turn
interactions by adapting traditional RL methods with token-level masking. It
features a decorator-based interface for defining tools and reward functions,
enabling seamless extension and ease of use. To support high-throughput
training, we implement asynchronous execution of tool calls and reward
computations, and design a centralized resource management system for scalable
environment coordination. We also provide a suite of prebuilt tools and
environments, demonstrating the framework's effectiveness through successful
agent training across multiple tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: InsightX Agent是一个基于大型多模态模型（LMM）的交互式X射线无损检测框架，通过结合稀疏可变形多尺度检测器（SDMSD）和证据基础反思工具（EGR），显著提升了检测的可靠性、可解释性和交互性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于深度学习的X射线检测方法缺乏交互性、可解释性和自我评估能力，限制了其可靠性和操作员信任度。

Method: InsightX Agent以LMM为核心协调器，结合SDMSD进行多尺度缺陷检测和EGR工具进行反思验证，实现主动推理。

Result: 在GDXray+数据集上，F1分数达到96.35%，同时显著提升了分析的可解释性和可信度。

Conclusion: InsightX Agent展示了基于LMM的代理框架在工业检测任务中的变革潜力。

Abstract: Non-destructive testing (NDT), particularly X-ray inspection, is vital for
industrial quality assurance, yet existing deep-learning-based approaches often
lack interactivity, interpretability, and the capacity for critical
self-assessment, limiting their reliability and operator trust. To address
these shortcomings, this paper proposes InsightX Agent, a novel LMM-based
agentic framework designed to deliver reliable, interpretable, and interactive
X-ray NDT analysis. Unlike typical sequential pipelines, InsightX Agent
positions a Large Multimodal Model (LMM) as a central orchestrator,
coordinating between the Sparse Deformable Multi-Scale Detector (SDMSD) and the
Evidence-Grounded Reflection (EGR) tool. The SDMSD generates dense defect
region proposals for multi-scale feature maps and sparsifies them through
Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS), optimizing detection of small, dense targets in
X-ray images while maintaining computational efficiency. The EGR tool guides
the LMM agent through a chain-of-thought-inspired review process, incorporating
context assessment, individual defect analysis, false positive elimination,
confidence recalibration and quality assurance to validate and refine the
SDMSD's initial proposals. By strategically employing and intelligently using
tools, InsightX Agent moves beyond passive data processing to active reasoning,
enhancing diagnostic reliability and providing interpretations that integrate
diverse information sources. Experimental evaluations on the GDXray+ dataset
demonstrate that InsightX Agent not only achieves a high object detection
F1-score of 96.35% but also offers significantly improved interpretability and
trustworthiness in its analyses, highlighting the transformative potential of
agentic LLM frameworks for industrial inspection tasks.

Motivation: 探索LLMs在自主决策中的适用性，尤其是其基于预训练知识的快速适应能力。

Method: 通过在线结构化提示策略，比较LLMs与传统强化学习方法的零样本表现。

Result: LLMs在简单环境中初始表现优异，但在复杂场景中规划和推理能力不足，反馈机制可能降低性能。

Conclusion: 需进一步研究混合策略、微调和高级记忆集成以提升LLMs的决策能力。

Abstract: The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract context from natural
language problem descriptions naturally raises questions about their
suitability in autonomous decision-making settings. This paper studies the
behaviour of these models within a Markov Decision Process (MDPs). While
traditional reinforcement learning (RL) strategies commonly employed in this
setting rely on iterative exploration, LLMs, pre-trained on diverse datasets,
offer the capability to leverage prior knowledge for faster adaptation. We
investigate online structured prompting strategies in sequential decision
making tasks, comparing the zero-shot performance of LLM-based approaches to
that of classical RL methods. Our findings reveal that although LLMs
demonstrate improved initial performance in simpler environments, they struggle
with planning and reasoning in complex scenarios without fine-tuning or
additional guidance. Our results show that feedback mechanisms, intended to
improve decision-making, often introduce confusion, leading to diminished
performance in intricate environments. These insights underscore the need for
further exploration into hybrid strategies, fine-tuning, and advanced memory
integration to enhance LLM-based decision-making capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 避免人工智能替代人类并解决责任缺口问题，推动人工智能伦理的多样化视角。

Method: 采用双重镜像过程，设计并测试了三个原型应用（贷款审批、肺炎诊断和艺术风格识别），结合XAI算法的反向和解释性部署。

Result: 实验显示用户对决策过程有完全控制感，同时为责任与问责制之间建立了桥梁。

Conclusion: 该方法在用户体验和伦理责任方面具有潜力，为人工智能的可靠部署提供了新思路。

Abstract: The Endless Tuning is a design method for a reliable deployment of artificial
intelligence based on a double mirroring process, which pursues both the goals
of avoiding human replacement and filling the so-called responsibility gap
(Matthias 2004). Originally depicted in (Fabris et al. 2024) and ensuing the
relational approach urged therein, it was then actualized in a protocol,
implemented in three prototypical applications regarding decision-making
processes (respectively: loan granting, pneumonia diagnosis, and art style
recognition) and tested with such as many domain experts. Step by step
illustrating the protocol, giving insights concretely showing a different voice
(Gilligan 1993) in the ethics of artificial intelligence, a philosophical
account of technical choices (e.g., a reversed and hermeneutic deployment of
XAI algorithms) will be provided in the present study together with the results
of the experiments, focusing on user experience rather than statistical
accuracy. Even thoroughly employing deep learning models, full control was
perceived by the interviewees in the decision-making setting, while it appeared
that a bridge can be built between accountability and liability in case of
damage.

Abstract: The global ageing population necessitates new and emerging strategies for
caring for older adults. In this article, we explore the potential for
transformation in elderly care through Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI),
powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). We discuss the proactive and
autonomous decision-making facilitated by Agentic AI in elderly care.
Personalized tracking of health, cognitive care, and environmental management,
all aimed at enhancing independence and high-level living for older adults,
represents important areas of application. With a potential for significant
transformation of elderly care, Agentic AI also raises profound concerns about
data privacy and security, decision independence, and access. We share key
insights to emphasize the need for ethical safeguards, privacy protections, and
transparent decision-making. Our goal in this article is to provide a balanced
discussion of both the potential and the challenges associated with Agentic AI,
and to provide insights into its responsible use in elderly care, to bring
Agentic AI into harmony with the requirements and vulnerabilities specific to
the elderly. Finally, we identify the priorities for the academic research
communities, to achieve human-centered advancements and integration of Agentic
AI in elderly care. To the best of our knowledge, this is no existing study
that reviews the role of Agentic AI in elderly care. Hence, we address the
literature gap by analyzing the unique capabilities, applications, and
limitations of LLM-based Agentic AI in elderly care. We also provide a

Conclusion: facet为命题溯因提供了更细粒度的分析工具，有助于理解解释的多样性，同时保持计算复杂性可控。

Abstract: Abductive reasoning is a popular non-monotonic paradigm that aims to explain
observed symptoms and manifestations. It has many applications, such as
diagnosis and planning in artificial intelligence and database updates. In
propositional abduction, we focus on specifying knowledge by a propositional
formula. The computational complexity of tasks in propositional abduction has
been systematically characterized - even with detailed classifications for
Boolean fragments. Unsurprisingly, the most insightful reasoning problems
(counting and enumeration) are computationally highly challenging. Therefore,
we consider reasoning between decisions and counting, allowing us to understand
explanations better while maintaining favorable complexity. We introduce facets
to propositional abductions, which are literals that occur in some explanation
(relevant) but not all explanations (dispensable). Reasoning with facets
provides a more fine-grained understanding of variability in explanations
(heterogeneous). In addition, we consider the distance between two
explanations, enabling a better understanding of heterogeneity/homogeneity. We
comprehensively analyze facets of propositional abduction in various settings,
including an almost complete characterization in Post's framework.

TL;DR: AlphaAlign是一个基于纯强化学习的框架，通过可验证的安全奖励激励大语言模型的潜在安全自我意识，解决现有安全对齐方法的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）在安全对齐后仍存在生成有害内容、过度拒绝和效用下降的问题，现有方法未能充分利用模型内在的安全自我意识。

Method: AlphaAlign采用双奖励系统：可验证的安全奖励鼓励对有害查询的正确拒绝和明确理由，同时惩罚过度拒绝；标准化的帮助性奖励指导对良性输入的高质量响应。

Result: AlphaAlign在简化性、效率、安全性与效用平衡以及深度对齐方面表现出显著优势，提升了模型的安全推理能力。

Conclusion: AlphaAlign通过强化学习有效激励模型的安全自我意识，解决了现有安全对齐方法的局限性，同时提升了模型的安全性和实用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite possessing latent safety understanding
from their vast pretraining data, remain vulnerable to generating harmful
content and exhibit issues such as over-refusal and utility degradation after
safety alignment. Current safety alignment methods often result in superficial
refusal shortcuts or rely on intensive supervision for reasoning-based
approaches, failing to fully leverage the model's intrinsic safety
self-awareness. We propose \textbf{AlphaAlign}, a simple yet effective pure
reinforcement learning (RL) framework with verifiable safety reward designed to
incentivize this latent safety awareness through proactive safety reasoning.}
AlphaAlign employs a dual-reward system: a verifiable safety reward encourages
correctly formatted and explicitly justified refusals for harmful queries while
penalizing over-refusals, and a normalized helpfulness reward guides
high-quality responses to benign inputs. This allows the model to develop
proactive safety reasoning capabilities without depending on supervised
safety-specific reasoning data. AlphaAlign demonstrates three key advantages:
(1) Simplicity and efficiency, requiring only binary prompt safety labels and
minimal RL steps for substantial improvements. (2) Breaking the safety-utility
trade-off, by enhancing refusal of harmful content and reducing over-refusals,
while simultaneously maintaining or even improving general task performance and
robustness to unseen jailbreaks. (3) Deep alignment, fostering proactive safety
reasoning that generates explicit safety rationales rather than relying on
shallow refusal patterns.

Motivation: 在智能时代，心理测量测试在人员选拔、职业发展和心理健康评估中日益重要。强制选择测试因其能降低回答失真风险而被广泛使用，但传统模型存在局限性。

Method: 通过非线性映射挖掘参与者和项目特征，使用多层神经网络建模其交互，并利用单调性假设提高诊断结果的可解释性。

Result: 在真实和模拟数据集上的实验验证了FCNCD的准确性、可解释性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FCNCD模型在强制选择测试中表现出色，克服了传统模型的不足，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In the smart era, psychometric tests are becoming increasingly important for
personnel selection, career development, and mental health assessment.
Forced-choice tests are common in personality assessments because they require
participants to select from closely related options, lowering the risk of
response distortion. This study presents a deep learning-based Forced-Choice
Neural Cognitive Diagnostic Model (FCNCD) that overcomes the limitations of
traditional models and is applicable to the three most common item block types
found in forced-choice tests. To account for the unidimensionality of items in
forced-choice tests, we create interpretable participant and item parameters.
We model the interactions between participant and item features using
multilayer neural networks after mining them using nonlinear mapping. In
addition, we use the monotonicity assumption to improve the interpretability of
the diagnostic results. The FCNCD's effectiveness is validated by experiments
on real-world and simulated datasets that show its accuracy, interpretability,
and robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗性提示攻击会显著影响RAG系统的可靠性，因此需要研究高效且隐蔽的攻击方法。

Method: 采用差分进化（DE）优化对抗性提示后缀，将RAG系统视为黑箱，通过进化候选后缀最大化目标错误文档的检索排名。

Result: 在BEIR QA数据集上的实验显示，DE方法攻击成功率高，且仅需少量标记（≤5），同时能逃避BERT检测器的检测。

Conclusion: DE方法在攻击RAG系统时表现出色，兼具高效性和隐蔽性，为对抗性攻击研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Adversarial prompt attacks can significantly alter the reliability of
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems by re-ranking them to produce
incorrect outputs. In this paper, we present a novel method that applies
Differential Evolution (DE) to optimize adversarial prompt suffixes for
RAG-based question answering. Our approach is gradient-free, treating the RAG
pipeline as a black box and evolving a population of candidate suffixes to
maximize the retrieval rank of a targeted incorrect document to be closer to
real world scenarios. We conducted experiments on the BEIR QA datasets to
evaluate attack success at certain retrieval rank thresholds under multiple
retrieving applications. Our results demonstrate that DE-based prompt
optimization attains competitive (and in some cases higher) success rates
compared to GGPP to dense retrievers and PRADA to sparse retrievers, while
using only a small number of tokens (<=5 tokens) in the adversarial suffix.
Furthermore, we introduce a readability-aware suffix construction strategy,
validated by a statistically significant reduction in MLM negative
log-likelihood with Welch's t-test. Through evaluations with a BERT-based
adversarial suffix detector, we show that DE-generated suffixes evade
detection, yielding near-chance detection accuracy.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于因果推理的Causal Action Influence Score (CAIS) 作为内在奖励，解决了传统强化学习在噪声环境中的脆弱性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类婴儿能有效发现自身的因果效能，而传统强化学习依赖相关性奖励，在噪声环境中表现不佳。

Method: 通过计算动作对感官结果分布的1-Wasserstein距离（p(h|a)与p(h)的差异），量化动作的因果影响。

Result: 在模拟婴儿-移动环境中，CAIS能有效过滤噪声并学习正确策略，同时复现了“消退爆发”现象。

Conclusion: 显式推断因果性是发展稳健代理感的关键机制，为自适应自主系统提供了心理学合理的框架。

Abstract: While human infants robustly discover their own causal efficacy, standard
reinforcement learning agents remain brittle, as their reliance on
correlation-based rewards fails in noisy, ecologically valid scenarios. To
address this, we introduce the Causal Action Influence Score (CAIS), a novel
intrinsic reward rooted in causal inference. CAIS quantifies an action's
influence by measuring the 1-Wasserstein distance between the learned
distribution of sensory outcomes conditional on that action, $p(h|a)$, and the
baseline outcome distribution, $p(h)$. This divergence provides a robust reward
that isolates the agent's causal impact from confounding environmental noise.
We test our approach in a simulated infant-mobile environment where
correlation-based perceptual rewards fail completely when the mobile is
subjected to external forces. In stark contrast, CAIS enables the agent to
filter this noise, identify its influence, and learn the correct policy.
Furthermore, the high-quality predictive model learned for CAIS allows our
agent, when augmented with a surprise signal, to successfully reproduce the
"extinction burst" phenomenon. We conclude that explicitly inferring causality
is a crucial mechanism for developing a robust sense of agency, offering a
psychologically plausible framework for more adaptive autonomous systems.

Abstract: Standard automated planning employs first-order formulas under closed-world
semantics to achieve a goal with a given set of actions from an initial state.
We follow a line of research that aims to incorporate background knowledge into
automated planning problems, for example, by means of ontologies, which are
usually interpreted under open-world semantics. We present a new approach for
planning with DL-Lite ontologies that combines the advantages of ontology-based
action conditions provided by explicit-input knowledge and action bases (eKABs)
and ontology-aware action effects under the coherence update semantics. We show
that the complexity of the resulting formalism is not higher than that of
previous approaches and provide an implementation via a polynomial compilation
into classical planning. An evaluation of existing and new benchmarks examines
the performance of a planning system on different variants of our compilation.

TL;DR: CSI是一种新型AI框架，通过模拟专家临床推理诊断118种口腔疾病，结合多模态CLIP模型和ChatGLM-6B语言模型，显著提升诊断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 口腔疾病诊断复杂且症状重叠，传统模式匹配方法效果有限，需模拟专家推理以提高临床实用性。

Method: 整合多模态CLIP模型与ChatGLM-6B语言模型，采用分层诊断推理树（HDRT）进行快速筛查和深度诊断。

Result: Fast Mode准确率73.4%，Standard Mode提升至89.5%，验证了分层推理的有效性。

Conclusion: CSI框架通过模拟专家逻辑显著提升诊断性能，为临床辅助工具提供了新思路。

Abstract: The diagnosis of oral diseases presents a problematic clinical challenge,
characterized by a wide spectrum of pathologies with overlapping
symptomatology. To address this, we developed Clinical Semantic Intelligence
(CSI), a novel artificial intelligence framework that diagnoses 118 different
oral diseases by computationally modeling the cognitive processes of an expert
clinician. Our core hypothesis is that moving beyond simple pattern matching to
emulate expert reasoning is critical to building clinically useful diagnostic
aids.
  CSI's architecture integrates a fine-tuned multimodal CLIP model with a
specialized ChatGLM-6B language model. This system executes a Hierarchical
Diagnostic Reasoning Tree (HDRT), a structured framework that distills the
systematic, multi-step logic of differential diagnosis. The framework operates
in two modes: a Fast Mode for rapid screening and a Standard Mode that
leverages the full HDRT for an interactive and in-depth diagnostic workup.
  To train and validate our system, we curated a primary dataset of 4,310
images, supplemented by an external hold-out set of 176 images for final
validation. A clinically-informed augmentation strategy expanded our training
data to over 30,000 image-text pairs. On a 431-image internal test set, CSI's
Fast Mode achieved an accuracy of 73.4%, which increased to 89.5% with the
HDRT-driven Standard Mode. The performance gain is directly attributable to the
hierarchical reasoning process. Herein, we detail the architectural philosophy,
development, and rigorous evaluation of the CSI framework.

Motivation: 评估在The Line这种前所未有的城市拓扑结构中，居民是否能够自由移动。

Method: 开发了结合基于代理的建模、强化学习、监督学习和图神经网络的混合仿真框架，模拟多模式交通行为。

Result: 实验显示，在完整AI架构下，平均通勤时间为7.8至8.4分钟，满意度超过89%，可达性超过91%。移除智能模块会显著降低性能。

Conclusion: 研究表明，The Line中的自由移动在概念和操作上均可行，但需依赖自适应AI系统、可持续基础设施和实时反馈。

Abstract: This paper investigates the feasibility of human mobility in The Line, a
proposed 170-kilometer linear smart city in NEOM, Saudi Arabia. To assess
whether citizens can move freely within this unprecedented urban topology, we
develop a hybrid simulation framework that integrates agent-based modeling,
reinforcement learning, supervised learning, and graph neural networks. The
simulation captures multi-modal transportation behaviors across 50 vertical
levels and varying density scenarios using both synthetic data and real-world
traces from high-density cities. Our experiments reveal that with the full
AI-integrated architecture, agents achieved an average commute time of 7.8 to
8.4 minutes, a satisfaction rate exceeding 89 percent, and a reachability index
of over 91 percent, even during peak congestion periods. Ablation studies
confirmed that the removal of intelligent modules such as reinforcement
learning or graph neural networks significantly degrades performance, with
commute times increasing by up to 85 percent and reachability falling below 70
percent. Environmental modeling further demonstrated low energy consumption and
minimal CO2 emissions when electric modes are prioritized. The findings suggest
that freedom of movement is not only conceptually achievable in The Line, but
also operationally realistic if supported by adaptive AI systems, sustainable
infrastructure, and real-time feedback loops.

Motivation: 通用LLM在形式化证明（如Lean 4）中表现不佳，现有方法需高成本的专业化模型。Delta Prover旨在通过代理框架解决这一问题。

Method: Delta Prover结合了反射分解与迭代证明修复的算法框架，以及基于Lean 4的领域特定语言（DSL），实现交互式证明构建。

Conclusion: 通用LLM在有效代理结构引导下具备未开发的定理证明能力，为形式化环境中的自动推理提供了高效替代方案。

Abstract: General-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success
in intelligence, performing comparably to human experts on complex reasoning
tasks such as coding and mathematical reasoning. However, generating formal
proofs in specialized languages like Lean 4 remains a significant challenge for
these models, limiting their application in complex theorem proving and
automated verification. Current approaches typically require specializing
models through fine-tuning on dedicated formal corpora, incurring high costs
for data collection and training. In this work, we introduce \textbf{Delta
Prover}, an agent-based framework that orchestrates the interaction between a
general-purpose LLM and the Lean 4 proof environment. Delta Prover leverages
the reflection and reasoning capabilities of general-purpose LLMs to
interactively construct formal proofs in Lean 4, circumventing the need for
model specialization. At its core, the agent integrates two novel,
interdependent components: an algorithmic framework for reflective
decomposition and iterative proof repair, and a custom Domain-Specific Language
(DSL) built upon Lean 4 for streamlined subproblem management. \textbf{Delta
Prover achieves a state-of-the-art 95.9\% success rate on the miniF2F-test
benchmark, surpassing all existing approaches, including those requiring model
specialization.} Furthermore, Delta Prover exhibits a significantly stronger
test-time scaling law compared to standard Best-of-N proof strategies.
Crucially, our findings demonstrate that general-purpose LLMs, when guided by
an effective agentic structure, possess substantial untapped theorem-proving
capabilities. This presents a computationally efficient alternative to
specialized models for robust automated reasoning in formal environments.

Abstract: Novel AI-based arc fault diagnosis models have demonstrated outstanding
performance in terms of classification accuracy. However, an inherent problem
is whether these models can actually be trusted to find arc faults. In this
light, this work proposes a soft evaluation indicator that explains the outputs
of arc fault diagnosis models, by defining the the correct explanation of arc
faults and leveraging Explainable Artificial Intelligence and real arc fault
experiments. Meanwhile, a lightweight balanced neural network is proposed to
guarantee competitive accuracy and soft feature extraction score. In our
experiments, several traditional machine learning methods and deep learning
methods across two arc fault datasets with different sample times and noise
levels are utilized to test the effectiveness of the soft evaluation indicator.
Through this approach, the arc fault diagnosis models are easy to understand
and trust, allowing practitioners to make informed and trustworthy decisions.

Result: 在多个数据集上，DMGC表现出最先进的性能，证明了其有效性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: DMGC为多模态图聚类提供了一种有效的无监督解决方案，填补了研究空白。

Abstract: Multimodal graphs, which integrate unstructured heterogeneous data with
structured interconnections, offer substantial real-world utility but remain
insufficiently explored in unsupervised learning. In this work, we initiate the
study of multimodal graph clustering, aiming to bridge this critical gap.
Through empirical analysis, we observe that real-world multimodal graphs often
exhibit hybrid neighborhood patterns, combining both homophilic and
heterophilic relationships. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
framework -- \textsc{Disentangled Multimodal Graph Clustering (DMGC)} -- which
decomposes the original hybrid graph into two complementary views: (1) a
homophily-enhanced graph that captures cross-modal class consistency, and (2)
heterophily-aware graphs that preserve modality-specific inter-class
distinctions. We introduce a \emph{Multimodal Dual-frequency Fusion} mechanism
that jointly filters these disentangled graphs through a dual-pass strategy,
enabling effective multimodal integration while mitigating category confusion.
Our self-supervised alignment objectives further guide the learning process
without requiring labels. Extensive experiments on both multimodal and
multi-relational graph datasets demonstrate that DMGC achieves state-of-the-art
performance, highlighting its effectiveness and generalizability across diverse
settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/Uncnbb/DMGC.

Abstract: The injection molding industry faces critical challenges in preserving and
transferring field knowledge, particularly as experienced workers retire and
multilingual barriers hinder effective communication. This study introduces
IM-Chat, a multi-agent framework based on large language models (LLMs),
designed to facilitate knowledge transfer in injection molding. IM-Chat
integrates both limited documented knowledge (e.g., troubleshooting tables,
manuals) and extensive field data modeled through a data-driven process
condition generator that infers optimal manufacturing settings from
environmental inputs such as temperature and humidity, enabling robust and
context-aware task resolution. By adopting a retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) strategy and tool-calling agents within a modular architecture, IM-Chat
ensures adaptability without the need for fine-tuning. Performance was assessed
across 100 single-tool and 60 hybrid tasks for GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and
GPT-3.5-turbo by domain experts using a 10-point rubric focused on relevance
and correctness, and was further supplemented by automated evaluation using
GPT-4o guided by a domain-adapted instruction prompt. The evaluation results
indicate that more capable models tend to achieve higher accuracy, particularly
in complex, tool-integrated scenarios. Overall, these findings demonstrate the
viability of multi-agent LLM systems for industrial knowledge workflows and
establish IM-Chat as a scalable and generalizable approach to AI-assisted
decision support in manufacturing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的外部对抗威胁（如提示注入）已被广泛研究，但内部产生的认知退化问题（如内存饥饿、规划递归等）尚未得到足够关注。这些内部问题会导致AI代理的静默漂移、逻辑崩溃和持续幻觉。

Method: 论文提出了QSAF Domain 10框架，包含六阶段认知退化生命周期和七种运行时控制（QSAF-BC-001至BC-007），通过实时监控和主动缓解措施（如回退路由、饥饿检测等）来应对认知退化。

Conclusion: 通过引入形式化的生命周期和实时缓解控制，该研究为AI系统的认知退化问题提供了系统性的解决方案，并为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: We introduce Cognitive Degradation as a novel vulnerability class in agentic
AI systems. Unlike traditional adversarial external threats such as prompt
injection, these failures originate internally, arising from memory starvation,
planner recursion, context flooding, and output suppression. These systemic
weaknesses lead to silent agent drift, logic collapse, and persistent
hallucinations over time. To address this class of failures, we introduce the
Qorvex Security AI Framework for Behavioral & Cognitive Resilience (QSAF Domain
10), a lifecycle-aware defense framework defined by a six-stage cognitive
degradation lifecycle. The framework includes seven runtime controls
(QSAF-BC-001 to BC-007) that monitor agent subsystems in real time and trigger
proactive mitigation through fallback routing, starvation detection, and memory
integrity enforcement. Drawing from cognitive neuroscience, we map agentic
architectures to human analogs, enabling early detection of fatigue,
starvation, and role collapse. By introducing a formal lifecycle and real-time
mitigation controls, this work establishes Cognitive Degradation as a critical
new class of AI system vulnerability and proposes the first cross-platform
defense model for resilient agentic behavior.

<details>

Motivation: 动态拼车平台面临实时匹配乘客与车辆的高维不确定性挑战，传统MARL方法因依赖准确估计Q/V值而效果不佳。

Method: 1. 将GRPO应用于拼车，用组平均奖励替代PPO基线以减少估计误差；2. 提出OSPO方法，仅使用一步奖励训练最优策略。

Result: 在真实曼哈顿数据集上，GRPO和OSPO在多数场景中表现优越，优化了接载时间和订单完成量。

Conclusion: GRPO和OSPO通过避免价值函数估计，显著提升了动态拼车匹配的效率和稳定性。

Abstract: On-demand ride-sharing platforms face the fundamental challenge of
dynamically bundling passengers with diverse origins and destinations and
matching them with vehicles in real time, all under significant uncertainty.
Recently, MARL has emerged as a promising solution for this problem, leveraging
decentralized learning to address the curse of dimensionality caused by the
large number of agents in the ride-hailing market and the resulting expansive
state and action spaces. However, conventional MARL-based ride-sharing
approaches heavily rely on the accurate estimation of Q-values or V-values,
which becomes problematic in large-scale, highly uncertain environments.
Specifically, most of these approaches adopt an independent paradigm,
exacerbating this issue, as each agent treats others as part of the
environment, leading to unstable training and substantial estimation bias in
value functions. To address these challenges, we propose two novel alternative
methods that bypass value function estimation. First, we adapt GRPO to
ride-sharing, replacing the PPO baseline with the group average reward to
eliminate critic estimation errors and reduce training bias. Second, inspired
by GRPO's full utilization of group reward information, we customize the PPO
framework for ride-sharing platforms and show that, under a homogeneous fleet,
the optimal policy can be trained using only one-step rewards - a method we
term One-Step Policy Optimization (OSPO). Experiments on a real-world Manhattan
ride-hailing dataset demonstrate that both GRPO and OSPO achieve superior
performance across most scenarios, efficiently optimizing pickup times and the
number of served orders using simple MLP networks.

Result: 实验表明RAD在多种基准测试中表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: RAD通过检索引导生成，有效提升离线强化学习的泛化能力和性能。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables agents to learn policies from
fixed datasets, avoiding costly or unsafe environment interactions. However,
its effectiveness is often limited by dataset sparsity and the lack of
transition overlap between suboptimal and expert trajectories, which makes
long-horizon planning particularly challenging. Prior solutions based on
synthetic data augmentation or trajectory stitching often fail to generalize to
novel states and rely on heuristic stitching points. To address these
challenges, we propose Retrieval High-quAlity Demonstrations (RAD) for
decision-making, which combines non-parametric retrieval with diffusion-based
generative modeling. RAD dynamically retrieves high-return states from the
offline dataset as target states based on state similarity and return
estimation, and plans toward them using a condition-guided diffusion model.
Such retrieval-guided generation enables flexible trajectory stitching and
improves generalization when encountered with underrepresented or
out-of-distribution states. Extensive experiments confirm that RAD achieves
competitive or superior performance compared to baselines across diverse
benchmarks, validating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效发现优化的批处理策略，为业务过程管理提供了实用工具。

Abstract: In business processes, activity batching refers to packing multiple activity
instances for joint execution. Batching allows managers to trade off cost and
processing effort against waiting time. Larger and less frequent batches may
lower costs by reducing processing effort and amortizing fixed costs, but they
create longer waiting times. In contrast, smaller and more frequent batches
reduce waiting times but increase fixed costs and processing effort. A batching
policy defines how activity instances are grouped into batches and when each
batch is activated. This paper addresses the problem of discovering batching
policies that strike optimal trade-offs between waiting time, processing
effort, and cost. The paper proposes a Pareto optimization approach that starts
from a given set (possibly empty) of activity batching policies and generates
alternative policies for each batched activity via intervention heuristics.
Each heuristic identifies an opportunity to improve an activity's batching
policy with respect to a metric (waiting time, processing time, cost, or
resource utilization) and an associated adjustment to the activity's batching
policy (the intervention). The impact of each intervention is evaluated via
simulation. The intervention heuristics are embedded in an optimization
meta-heuristic that triggers interventions to iteratively update the Pareto
front of the interventions identified so far. The paper considers three
meta-heuristics: hill-climbing, simulated annealing, and reinforcement
learning. An experimental evaluation compares the proposed approach based on
intervention heuristics against the same (non-heuristic guided) meta-heuristics
baseline regarding convergence, diversity, and cycle time gain of
Pareto-optimal policies.

Conclusion: Chart-R1通过强化学习微调和数据合成技术，显著提升了图表推理能力，为多模态推理研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recently, inspired by OpenAI-o1/o3 and Deepseek-R1, the R1-Style method based
on reinforcement learning fine-tuning has received widespread attention from
the community. Previous R1-Style methods mainly focus on mathematical reasoning
and code intelligence. It is of great research significance to verify their
advantages on more general multimodal data. Chart is an important multimodal
data type with rich information, which brings important research challenges in
complex reasoning. In this work, we introduce Chart-R1, a chart-domain
vision-language model with reinforcement learning fine-tuning to enable complex
chart reasoning. To support Chart-R1, we first propose a novel programmatic
data synthesis technology to generate high-quality step-by-step chart reasoning
data covering single- and multi-subcharts, which makes up for the lack of
reasoning data in the chart domain. Then we develop a two-stage training
strategy: Chart-COT with step-by-step chain-of-thought supervision, and
Chart-RFT with numerically sensitive reinforcement fine-tuning. Chart-COT aims
to decompose complex chart reasoning tasks into fine-grained, understandable
subtasks through step-by-step supervision, which lays a good foundation for
improving the reasoning level of reinforcement learning. Chart-RFT utilize the
typical group relative policy optimization strategy, in which a relatively soft
reward is adopted for numerical response to emphasize the numerical sensitivity
in the chart domain. We conduct extensive experiments on open-source benchmarks
and self-built chart reasoning dataset (\emph{i.e., ChartRQA}). Experimental
results show that Chart-R1 has significant advantages compared to chart-domain
methods, even comparable to open/closed source large-scale models (\emph{e.g.,
GPT-4o, Claude-3.5}).

Conclusion: HAMLET为交互式叙事领域提供了新的解决方案，提升了戏剧表演的互动性和沉浸感。

Abstract: Creating an immersive and interactive theatrical experience is a long-term
goal in the field of interactive narrative. The emergence of large language
model (LLM) is providing a new path to achieve this goal. However, existing
LLM-based drama generation methods often result in AI agents that lack
initiative and cannot interact with the physical environment. Furthermore,
these methods typically require detailed user input to drive the drama. These
limitations reduce the interactivity and immersion of online real-time
performance. To address the above challenges, we propose HAMLET, a multi-agent
framework focused on drama creation and online performance. Given a simple
topic, the framework generates a narrative blueprint, guiding the subsequent
improvisational performance. During the online performance, each actor is given
an autonomous mind. This means that actors can make independent decisions based
on their own background, goals, and emotional state. In addition to
conversations with other actors, their decisions can also change the state of
scene props through actions such as opening a letter or picking up a weapon.
The change is then broadcast to other related actors, updating what they know
and care about, which in turn influences their next action. To evaluate the
quality of drama performance, we designed an evaluation method to assess three
primary aspects, including character performance, narrative quality, and
interaction experience. The experimental evaluation shows that HAMLET can
create expressive and coherent theatrical experiences. Our code, dataset and
models are available at https://github.com/HAMLET-2025/HAMLET.

Conclusion: LLMs可能具备初步的世界模型能力，但推理能力有限，认知科学方法有助于评估AI系统的世界建模能力。

Abstract: Do large language models (LLMs) construct and manipulate internal world
models, or do they rely solely on statistical associations represented as
output layer token probabilities? We adapt cognitive science methodologies from
human mental models research to test LLMs on pulley system problems using
TikZ-rendered stimuli. Study 1 examines whether LLMs can estimate mechanical
advantage (MA). State-of-the-art models performed marginally but significantly
above chance, and their estimates correlated significantly with ground-truth
MA. Significant correlations between number of pulleys and model estimates
suggest that models employed a pulley counting heuristic, without necessarily
simulating pulley systems to derive precise values. Study 2 tested this by
probing whether LLMs represent global features crucial to MA estimation. Models
evaluated a functionally connected pulley system against a fake system with
randomly placed components. Without explicit cues, models identified the
functional system as having greater MA with F1=0.8, suggesting LLMs could
represent systems well enough to differentiate jumbled from functional systems.
Study 3 built on this by asking LLMs to compare functional systems with matched
systems which were connected up but which transferred no force to the weight;
LLMs identified the functional system with F1=0.46, suggesting random guessing.
Insofar as they may generalize, these findings are compatible with the notion
that LLMs manipulate internal world models, sufficient to exploit statistical
associations between pulley count and MA (Study 1), and to approximately
represent system components' spatial relations (Study 2). However, they may
lack the facility to reason over nuanced structural connectivity (Study 3). We
conclude by advocating the utility of cognitive scientific methods to evaluate
the world-modeling capacities of artificial intelligence systems.

Method: 1. 参数化SPI算法；2. 基于游戏抽象的预处理技术；3. 基于SMT求解的高级预处理技术。

Result: 实验表明，这些技术将SPI的数据效率提高了多个数量级，同时保持相同的可靠性保证。

Conclusion: 通过利用参数依赖关系和高级预处理技术，显著提升了离线强化学习的数据效率。

Abstract: Safe policy improvement (SPI) is an offline reinforcement learning problem in
which a new policy that reliably outperforms the behavior policy with high
confidence needs to be computed using only a dataset and the behavior policy.
Markov decision processes (MDPs) are the standard formalism for modeling
environments in SPI. In many applications, additional information in the form
of parametric dependencies between distributions in the transition dynamics is
available. We make SPI more data-efficient by leveraging these dependencies
through three contributions: (1) a parametric SPI algorithm that exploits known
correlations between distributions to more accurately estimate the transition
dynamics using the same amount of data; (2) a preprocessing technique that
prunes redundant actions from the environment through a game-based abstraction;
and (3) a more advanced preprocessing technique, based on satisfiability modulo
theory (SMT) solving, that can identify more actions to prune. Empirical
results and an ablation study show that our techniques increase the data
efficiency of SPI by multiple orders of magnitude while maintaining the same
reliability guarantees.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多选问题（MCQ）是评估大语言模型（LLM）能力的常用方法，但现有研究未充分评估其指标，且存在答案波动问题。

Method: 提出一种指标评估协议，通过分析指标与答案波动率及原始性能的关系来评估方法。

Result: 结果显示现有指标与答案波动率有强关联，而最差准确率在新协议中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 最差准确率是一种有效的评估指标，可用于解决MCQ评估中的答案波动问题。

Abstract: Using multiple-choice questions (MCQs) has become a standard for assessing
LLM capabilities efficiently. A variety of metrics can be employed for this
task. However, previous research has not conducted a thorough assessment of
them. At the same time, MCQ evaluation suffers from answer fluctuation: models
produce different results given slight changes in prompts. We suggest a metric
assessment protocol in which evaluation methodologies are analyzed through
their connection with fluctuation rates, as well as original performance. Our
results show that there is a strong link between existing metrics and the
answer changing, even when computed without any additional prompt variants. A
novel metric, worst accuracy, demonstrates the highest association on the
protocol.

Motivation: 现有AI代理虽强大，但缺乏根据战术指令动态调整策略的能力。

Method: 冻结预训练策略网络（DI-Star），为每个动作头附加轻量级适配器模块，通过KL散度约束训练适配器。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效调节代理行为（如侵略性、扩张模式和技术偏好），同时保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 该方法以最小计算开销实现灵活战术控制，适用于复杂即时战略游戏。

Abstract: We present an adapter-based approach for tactical conditioning of StarCraft
II AI agents. Current agents, while powerful, lack the ability to adapt their
strategies based on high-level tactical directives. Our method freezes a
pre-trained policy network (DI-Star) and attaches lightweight adapter modules
to each action head, conditioned on a tactical tensor that encodes strategic
preferences. By training these adapters with KL divergence constraints, we
ensure the policy maintains core competencies while exhibiting tactical
variations. Experimental results show our approach successfully modulates agent
behavior across tactical dimensions including aggression, expansion patterns,
and technology preferences, while maintaining competitive performance. Our
method enables flexible tactical control with minimal computational overhead,
offering practical strategy customization for complex real-time strategy games.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为g-AMIE的多代理系统框架，用于在医疗诊断对话中实现异步监督，确保AI系统在安全范围内运行，并通过临床医生监督提升决策质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统在医疗诊断对话中表现优异，但实际应用中需确保患者安全，因此需要专业医生的监督。受此启发，研究旨在设计一种框架，使AI系统能在医生监督下高效运行。

Method: 提出g-AMIE框架，该系统在限定范围内进行病史采集，避免提供个性化医疗建议，并通过临床医生界面将评估结果提交给主治医生进行监督。通过随机双盲虚拟OSCE实验，比较g-AMIE与NPs/PAs及PCPs的表现。

Result: 在60个场景中，g-AMIE在高质量病史采集、病例总结及诊断和管理计划方面优于NPs/PAs和PCPs，且监督效率更高。

Conclusion: 异步监督是一种可行的范式，可使诊断AI系统在专家监督下提升实际医疗质量。

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated the promise of conversational AI systems for
diagnostic dialogue. However, real-world assurance of patient safety means that
providing individual diagnoses and treatment plans is considered a regulated
activity by licensed professionals. Furthermore, physicians commonly oversee
other team members in such activities, including nurse practitioners (NPs) or
physician assistants/associates (PAs). Inspired by this, we propose a framework
for effective, asynchronous oversight of the Articulate Medical Intelligence
Explorer (AMIE) AI system. We propose guardrailed-AMIE (g-AMIE), a multi-agent
system that performs history taking within guardrails, abstaining from
individualized medical advice. Afterwards, g-AMIE conveys assessments to an
overseeing primary care physician (PCP) in a clinician cockpit interface. The
PCP provides oversight and retains accountability of the clinical decision.
This effectively decouples oversight from intake and can thus happen
asynchronously. In a randomized, blinded virtual Objective Structured Clinical
Examination (OSCE) of text consultations with asynchronous oversight, we
compared g-AMIE to NPs/PAs or a group of PCPs under the same guardrails. Across
60 scenarios, g-AMIE outperformed both groups in performing high-quality
intake, summarizing cases, and proposing diagnoses and management plans for the
overseeing PCP to review. This resulted in higher quality composite decisions.
PCP oversight of g-AMIE was also more time-efficient than standalone PCP
consultations in prior work. While our study does not replicate existing
clinical practices and likely underestimates clinicians' capabilities, our
results demonstrate the promise of asynchronous oversight as a feasible
paradigm for diagnostic AI systems to operate under expert human oversight for
enhancing real-world care.

TL;DR: LAPO是一种新型框架，通过两阶段强化学习将推理长度控制内化为模型能力，减少40.9%的token使用并提升2.3%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型推理模型因过度生成token而效率低下的问题。

Method: 两阶段强化学习：第一阶段学习成功解的长度分布，第二阶段将其作为元认知指导嵌入模型。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，减少40.9%的token使用并提升2.3%的准确率。

Conclusion: LAPO使模型能够根据问题复杂度分配计算资源，实现高效且高质量的推理。

Abstract: Large reasoning models have achieved remarkable performance through extended
chain-of-thought sequences, yet this computational freedom leads to excessive
token generation even for simple problems. We present Length-Adaptive Policy
Optimization (LAPO), a novel framework that transforms reasoning length control
from an external constraint into an intrinsic model capability. Unlike existing
approaches that impose rigid limits or rely on post-hoc interventions, LAPO
enables models to internalize an understanding of appropriate reasoning depth
through a two-stage reinforcement learning process. In the first stage, models
learn natural reasoning patterns by discovering the statistical distribution of
successful solution lengths. The second stage leverages these patterns as
meta-cognitive guidance, embedding them directly within the model's reasoning
context to ensure inference-time flexibility. Experiments on mathematical
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that LAPO reduces token usage by up to 40.9\%
while improving accuracy by 2.3\%. Our analysis reveals that models trained
with LAPO develop emergent abilities to allocate computational resources based
on problem complexity, achieving efficient reasoning without sacrificing
quality.

TL;DR: GasAgent是一个多代理系统，用于智能合约的Gas优化，结合了现有模式的兼容性和新模式的自动化发现/验证，实现了端到端优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有解决方案依赖人工发现Gas浪费模式，效率低、维护成本高且难以扩展。LLMs虽然能探索新模式，但兼容性差且需手动验证。

Method: GasAgent由四个专业代理（Seeker、Innovator、Executor、Manager）组成，协作闭环识别、验证和应用Gas节省改进。

Result: 在100个真实合约中优化了82个，平均部署Gas节省9.97%。在500个LLM生成合约中优化了79.8%，Gas节省4.79%-13.93%。

Conclusion: GasAgent作为LLM辅助智能合约开发的优化层，具有广泛适用性和高效性。

Abstract: Smart contracts are trustworthy, immutable, and automatically executed
programs on the blockchain. Their execution requires the Gas mechanism to
ensure efficiency and fairness. However, due to non-optimal coding practices,
many contracts contain Gas waste patterns that need to be optimized. Existing
solutions mostly rely on manual discovery, which is inefficient, costly to
maintain, and difficult to scale. Recent research uses large language models
(LLMs) to explore new Gas waste patterns. However, it struggles to remain
compatible with existing patterns, often produces redundant patterns, and
requires manual validation/rewriting. To address this gap, we present GasAgent,
the first multi-agent system for smart contract Gas optimization that combines
compatibility with existing patterns and automated discovery/validation of new
patterns, enabling end-to-end optimization. GasAgent consists of four
specialized agents, Seeker, Innovator, Executor, and Manager, that collaborate
in a closed loop to identify, validate, and apply Gas-saving improvements.
Experiments on 100 verified real-world contracts demonstrate that GasAgent
successfully optimizes 82 contracts, achieving an average deployment Gas
savings of 9.97%. In addition, our evaluation confirms its compatibility with
existing tools and validates the effectiveness of each module through ablation
studies. To assess broader usability, we further evaluate 500 contracts
generated by five representative LLMs across 10 categories and find that
GasAgent optimizes 79.8% of them, with deployment Gas savings ranging from
4.79% to 13.93%, showing its usability as the optimization layer for
LLM-assisted smart contract development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着服务计算、云计算和物联网的发展，服务生态系统日益复杂，传统因果方法难以分析智能体间的异常涌现现象。

Method: EAMI框架采用双视角思维跟踪机制（Inspector Agent和Analysis Agent）提取意图，结合k-means聚类和意图时序涌现图进行动态分析。

Result: 实验在O2O服务系统和Stanford AI Town中验证了EAMI的有效性、通用性和效率。

Conclusion: EAMI为服务生态系统中的异常涌现和因果分析提供了新范式。

Abstract: With the rise of service computing, cloud computing, and IoT, service
ecosystems are becoming increasingly complex. The intricate interactions among
intelligent agents make abnormal emergence analysis challenging, as traditional
causal methods focus on individual trajectories. Large language models offer
new possibilities for Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) through Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning to reveal agent intentions. However, existing approaches remain
limited to microscopic and static analysis. This paper introduces a framework:
Emergence Analysis based on Multi-Agent Intention (EAMI), which enables dynamic
and interpretable emergence analysis. EAMI first employs a dual-perspective
thought track mechanism, where an Inspector Agent and an Analysis Agent extract
agent intentions under bounded and perfect rationality. Then, k-means
clustering identifies phase transition points in group intentions, followed by
a Intention Temporal Emergence diagram for dynamic analysis. The experiments
validate EAMI in complex online-to-offline (O2O) service system and the
Stanford AI Town experiment, with ablation studies confirming its
effectiveness, generalizability, and efficiency. This framework provides a
novel paradigm for abnormal emergence and causal analysis in service
ecosystems. The code is available at

Abstract: In recent years, the development of Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (TAI)
has emerged as a critical objective in the deployment of AI systems across
sensitive and high-risk domains. TAI frameworks articulate a comprehensive set
of ethical, legal, and technical requirements to ensure that AI technologies
are aligned with human values, rights, and societal expectations. Among the
various AI paradigms, Federated Learning (FL) presents a promising solution to
pressing privacy concerns. However, aligning FL with the rest of the
requirements of TAI presents a series of challenges, most of which arise from
its inherently distributed nature. In this work, we adopt the requirements TAI
as a guiding structure to systematically analyze the challenges of adapting FL
to TAI. Specifically, we classify and examine the key obstacles to aligning FL
with TAI, providing a detailed exploration of what has been done, the trends,
and the remaining work within each of the identified challenges.

represents an equivalence class of graphs that is restricted by background

formula when the conditioning set is unaffected by treatment, a generalization
of the well-known do calculus to the MPDAG setting, and an algorithm that is
complete for identifying these conditional effects.

Motivation: 解决大型推理模型在统一推理策略下计算效率低下的问题，探索如何在不牺牲能力的情况下优化推理深度。

Method: 采用分层预算探索，将样本划分为不同预算子组，并引入差异化奖励机制，使模型能根据问题复杂度分配资源。

Result: 实验表明，HBPO在四个推理基准上平均减少60.6%的token使用，同时准确率提升3.14%。

Conclusion: 推理效率和能力并非固有冲突，通过分层训练可同时优化，模型能自适应调整推理深度。

Abstract: Large reasoning models achieve remarkable performance through extensive
chain-of-thought generation, yet exhibit significant computational inefficiency
by applying uniform reasoning strategies regardless of problem complexity. We
present Hierarchical Budget Policy Optimization (HBPO), a reinforcement
learning framework that enables models to learn problem-specific reasoning
depths without sacrificing capability. HBPO addresses the fundamental challenge
of exploration space collapse in efficiency-oriented training, where penalties
on long output length systematically bias models away from necessary long
reasoning paths. Through hierarchical budget exploration, our approach
partitions rollout samples into multiple subgroups with distinct token budgets,
aiming to enable efficient resource allocation while preventing degradation of
capability. We introduce differentiated reward mechanisms that create
budget-aware incentives aligned with the complexity of the problem, allowing
models to discover natural correspondences between task requirements and
computational effort. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HBPO reduces
average token usage by up to 60.6% while improving accuracy by 3.14% across
four reasoning benchmarks. Unlike existing methods that impose external
constraints or rely on discrete mode selection, HBPO exhibits emergent adaptive
behavior where models automatically adjust reasoning depth based on problem
complexity. Our results suggest that reasoning efficiency and capability are
not inherently conflicting, and can be simultaneously optimized through
appropriately structured hierarchical training that preserves exploration
diversity.

Conclusion: 提出体验主义视角，认为LLMs的认知是内部表征系统对外部世界的主观构建，暗示AI对齐需关注内部引导。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance, they exhibit certain
cognitive patterns similar to those of humans that are not directly specified
in training data. This study investigates this phenomenon by focusing on
temporal cognition in LLMs. Leveraging the similarity judgment task, we find
that larger models spontaneously establish a subjective temporal reference
point and adhere to the Weber-Fechner law, whereby the perceived distance
logarithmically compresses as years recede from this reference point. To
uncover the mechanisms behind this behavior, we conducted multiple analyses
across neuronal, representational, and informational levels. We first identify
a set of temporal-preferential neurons and find that this group exhibits
minimal activation at the subjective reference point and implements a
logarithmic coding scheme convergently found in biological systems. Probing
representations of years reveals a hierarchical construction process, where
years evolve from basic numerical values in shallow layers to abstract temporal
orientation in deep layers. Finally, using pre-trained embedding models, we
found that the training corpus itself possesses an inherent, non-linear
temporal structure, which provides the raw material for the model's internal
construction. In discussion, we propose an experientialist perspective for
understanding these findings, where the LLMs' cognition is viewed as a
subjective construction of the external world by its internal representational
system. This nuanced perspective implies the potential emergence of alien
cognitive frameworks that humans cannot intuitively predict, pointing toward a
direction for AI alignment that focuses on guiding internal constructions. Our
