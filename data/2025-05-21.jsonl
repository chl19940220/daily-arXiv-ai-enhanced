We conjecture that this observed improvement\nis partially due to the answer distribution of standard evaluation benchmarks,\nwhich is skewed towards a relatively small set of common answers. To test this\nconjecture, we define a baseline that enumerates answers according to their\nprevalence in the training set. Experiments spanning two domains --\nmathematical reasoning and factual knowledge -- reveal that this baseline\noutperforms repeated model sampling for some LLMs, while the coverage for\nothers is on par with that of a mixture strategy that obtains $k$ answers by\nusing only $10$ model samples and similarly guessing the remaining $k-10$\nattempts via enumeration. Our baseline enables a more accurate measurement of\nhow much repeated sampling improves coverage in such settings beyond\nprompt-agnostic guessing."}

By mapping existing\ncontributions, from symbolic AI techniques and connectionist LLM-based agents\nto hybrid organizational practices, onto this proposed framework (Hierarchical\nExploration-Exploitation Net), our approach facilitates revision of legacy\nmethods and inspires new work that fuses qualitative and quantitative\nparadigms.

In this paper, we expose and analyze\na widespread problem--false negatives--where verifiers wrongly reject correct\nmodel outputs. Our in-depth study of the Big-Math-RL-Verified dataset reveals\nthat over 38% of model-generated responses suffer from false negatives, where\nthe verifier fails to recognize correct answers. We show, both empirically and\ntheoretically, that these false negatives severely impair RL training by\ndepriving the model of informative gradient signals and slowing convergence. To\nmitigate this, we propose tinyV, a lightweight LLM-based verifier that augments\nexisting rule-based methods, which dynamically identifies potential false\nnegatives and recovers valid responses to produce more accurate reward\nestimates. Across multiple math-reasoning benchmarks, integrating TinyV boosts\npass rates by up to 10% and accelerates convergence relative to the baseline.\nOur findings highlight the critical importance of addressing verifier false\nnegatives and offer a practical approach to improve RL-based fine-tuning of\nLLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/uw-nsl/TinyV."}

This is typically achieved through instruction tuning and\nreinforcement learning from human feedback. However, this alignment is known to\nbe brittle: further fine-tuning, even on benign or lightly contaminated data,\ncan degrade safety and reintroduce harmful behaviors. A growing body of work\nsuggests that alignment may correspond to identifiable geometric directions in\nweight space, forming subspaces that could, in principle, be isolated or\npreserved to defend against misalignment. In this work, we conduct a\ncomprehensive empirical study of this geometric perspective. We examine whether\nsafety-relevant behavior is concentrated in specific subspaces, whether it can\nbe separated from general-purpose learning, and whether harmfulness arises from\ndistinguishable patterns in internal representations. Across both parameter and\nactivation space, our findings are consistent: subspaces that amplify safe\nbehaviors also amplify unsafe ones, and prompts with different safety\nimplications activate overlapping representations. We find no evidence of a\nsubspace that selectively governs safety. These results challenge the\nassumption that alignment is geometrically localized. Rather than residing in\ndistinct directions, safety appears to emerge from entangled, high-impact\ncomponents of the model's broader learning dynamics. This suggests that\nsubspace-based defenses may face fundamental limitations and underscores the\nneed for alternative strategies to preserve alignment under continued training.\nWe corroborate these findings through multiple experiments on five open-source\nLLMs. Our code is publicly available at:\nhttps://github.com/CERT-Lab/safety-subspaces."}

Amid the growing hype around improved\nreasoning abilities attributed to RL post-training, we critically examine the\nformulation and assumptions underlying these methods. We start by highlighting\nthe popular structural assumptions made in modeling LLM training as a Markov\nDecision Process (MDP), and show how they lead to a degenerate MDP that doesn't\nquite need the RL/GRPO apparatus. The two critical structural assumptions\ninclude (1) making the MDP states be just a concatenation of the actions-with\nstates becoming the context window and the actions becoming the tokens in LLMs\nand (2) splitting the reward of a state-action trajectory uniformly across the\ntrajectory. Through a comprehensive analysis, we demonstrate that these\nsimplifying assumptions make the approach effectively equivalent to an\noutcome-driven supervised learning. Our experiments on benchmarks including\nGSM8K and Countdown using Qwen-2.5 base models show that iterative supervised\nfine-tuning, incorporating both positive and negative samples, achieves\nperformance comparable to GRPO-based training. We will also argue that the\nstructural assumptions indirectly incentivize the RL to generate longer\nsequences of intermediate tokens-which in turn feeds into the narrative of \"RL\ngenerating longer thinking traces.\" While RL may well be a very useful\ntechnique for improving the reasoning abilities of LLMs, our analysis shows\nthat the simplistic structural assumptions made in modeling the underlying MDP\nrender the popular LLM RL frameworks and their interpretations questionable."}
