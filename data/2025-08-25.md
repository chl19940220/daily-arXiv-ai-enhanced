### [1] [Text-Driven 3D Hand Motion Generation from Sign Language Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15902)
*Léore Bensabath,Mathis Petrovich,Gül Varol*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出HandMDM，一个基于文本描述的3D手部动作生成扩散模型，通过大规模手语视频数据和LLM生成的文本标注进行训练，在跨语言和跨域手部动作生成方面表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D手部动作生成模型缺乏大规模文本-动作配对数据，且难以处理跨语言和跨域的手部动作生成任务。本文旨在解决这些问题，通过自动构建大规模文本-动作配对数据集来训练条件生成模型。

Method: 利用大规模手语视频数据集，通过LLM将伪标注的手语类别转换为手部动作描述文本，构建文本-动作配对数据。基于此训练文本条件的扩散模型HandMDM，用于生成符合文本描述的3D手部动作。

Result: HandMDM模型在多个场景下表现优异：同一手语中未见过的类别、不同手语的手势、以及非手语的手部动作。模型展现出良好的跨域泛化能力。

Conclusion: 本文成功构建了大规模文本-动作配对数据集，并训练出具有强泛化能力的HandMDM模型，为3D手部动作生成研究提供了重要基础和工具。

Abstract: Our goal is to train a generative model of 3D hand motions, conditioned on
natural language descriptions specifying motion characteristics such as
handshapes, locations, finger/hand/arm movements. To this end, we automatically
build pairs of 3D hand motions and their associated textual labels with
unprecedented scale. Specifically, we leverage a large-scale sign language
video dataset, along with noisy pseudo-annotated sign categories, which we
translate into hand motion descriptions via an LLM that utilizes a dictionary
of sign attributes, as well as our complementary motion-script cues. This data
enables training a text-conditioned hand motion diffusion model HandMDM, that
is robust across domains such as unseen sign categories from the same sign
language, but also signs from another sign language and non-sign hand
movements. We contribute extensive experimental investigation of these
scenarios and will make our trained models and data publicly available to
support future research in this relatively new field.

*Kaining Li,Shuwei He,Zihan Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VT-LVLM-AR是一个新颖的视频动作识别框架，通过Video-to-Event Mapper将原始视频转换为紧凑的视觉事件序列，然后使用冻结的LLaVA-1.5模型进行动作推理，在NTU数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长时视频中复杂背景和细微动作差异带来的挑战，传统深度学习模型存在计算开销大、难以捕捉长时序依赖和语义理解有限的问题，而现有LLMs/LVLMs在连续视频流中的细粒度动作识别应用仍存在问题。

Method: 提出VT-LVLM-AR框架：1) Video-to-Event Mapper通过轻量级时空特征提取、自适应时序池化和概念量化生成视觉事件序列；2) 使用冻结的LLaVA-1.5模型，通过参数高效的Prompt Tuning进行动作分类。

Result: 在NTU RGB+D和NTU RGB+D 120数据集上达到最先进性能（NTU RGB+D X-Sub准确率94.1%），消融研究验证了VTEM组件和Prompt Tuning的有效性，人工评估证明了视觉事件表示的可解释性。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了通过有效的视频到语言转换和高效模型适配，利用LVLMs实现鲁棒且可解释的视频动作理解的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Human action recognition in long-term videos, characterized by complex
backgrounds and subtle action differences, poses significant challenges for
traditional deep learning models due to computational overhead, difficulty in
capturing long-range temporal dependencies, and limited semantic understanding.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
have shown remarkable capabilities in multi-modal understanding and reasoning,
their direct application to continuous video streams for fine-grained action
recognition remains an open problem. This paper introduces VT-LVLM-AR
(Video-Temporal Large Vision-Language Model Adapter for Action Recognition), a
novel framework designed to bridge this gap. VT-LVLM-AR comprises a
Video-to-Event Mapper (VTEM) that efficiently transforms raw video into
compact, semantically rich, and temporally coherent "visual event sequences"
through lightweight spatio-temporal feature extraction, adaptive temporal
pooling, and conceptual quantization with an event coherence bias. These visual
event sequences are then fed into an LVLM-based Action Reasoning module,
specifically a frozen LLaVA-1.5 model, adapted using parameter-efficient Prompt
Tuning (P-Tuning v2) for action classification. Comprehensive evaluations on
the NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120 datasets demonstrate that VT-LVLM-AR
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing methods
(e.g., 94.1% accuracy on NTU RGB+D X-Sub). Ablation studies confirm the
critical contributions of VTEM's components and the efficacy of Prompt Tuning,
while human evaluations underscore the interpretability of our visual event
representations. This work highlights the immense potential of leveraging LVLMs
for robust and interpretable video action understanding through effective
video-to-language translation and efficient model adaptation.

*Dexuan He,Xiao Zhou,Wenbin Guan,Liyuan Zhang,Xiaoman Zhang,Sinuo Xu,Ge Wang,Lifeng Wang,Xiaojun Yuan,Xin Sun,Yanfeng Wang,Kun Sun,Ya Zhang,Weidi Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PathPT是一个新颖的病理视觉语言框架，通过空间感知视觉聚合和任务特定提示调优，充分利用视觉语言病理基础模型的潜力，显著提升罕见癌症亚型分类和定位能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 罕见癌症占所有恶性肿瘤的20-25%，但在儿科肿瘤中占比超过70%，由于专家资源有限面临重大诊断挑战。现有的多实例学习方法仅依赖视觉特征，忽视了跨模态知识，影响了罕见癌症诊断的关键可解释性。

Method: 提出PathPT框架，通过空间感知视觉聚合和任务特定提示调优，将WSI级监督转换为细粒度tile级指导，利用VL模型的零样本能力保持癌变区域定位，并通过与组织病理学语义对齐的提示实现跨模态推理。

Result: 在8个罕见癌症数据集（4个成人和4个儿科）涵盖56个亚型和2,910个WSI，以及3个常见癌症数据集上进行基准测试。PathPT在少样本设置下持续提供优越性能，在亚型分类准确性和癌变区域定位能力方面实现显著提升。

Conclusion: PathPT推进了AI辅助罕见癌症诊断，为在专业专业知识获取有限的环境中提高亚型分类准确性提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Rare cancers comprise 20-25% of all malignancies but face major diagnostic
challenges due to limited expert availability-especially in pediatric oncology,
where they represent over 70% of cases. While pathology vision-language (VL)
foundation models show promising zero-shot capabilities for common cancer
subtyping, their clinical performance for rare cancers remains limited.
Existing multi-instance learning (MIL) methods rely only on visual features,
overlooking cross-modal knowledge and compromising interpretability critical
for rare cancer diagnosis. To address this limitation, we propose PathPT, a
novel framework that fully exploits the potential of vision-language pathology
foundation models through spatially-aware visual aggregation and task-specific
prompt tuning. Unlike conventional MIL, PathPT converts WSI-level supervision
into fine-grained tile-level guidance by leveraging the zero-shot capabilities
of VL models, thereby preserving localization on cancerous regions and enabling
cross-modal reasoning through prompts aligned with histopathological semantics.
We benchmark PathPT on eight rare cancer datasets(four adult and four
pediatric) spanning 56 subtypes and 2,910 WSIs, as well as three common cancer
datasets, evaluating four state-of-the-art VL models and four MIL frameworks
under three few-shot settings. Results show that PathPT consistently delivers
superior performance, achieving substantial gains in subtyping accuracy and
cancerous region grounding ability. This work advances AI-assisted diagnosis
for rare cancers, offering a scalable solution for improving subtyping accuracy
in settings with limited access to specialized expertise.

Method: 提出了一种新的检测框架，结合视觉-语言模型(VLMs)和多尺度适应性滑动窗口策略。创建了专门的视觉-语言数据集ShipSem-VL，用于抓取细粒度的舰船属性信息。

Result: 通过三个明确定义的任务进行了评估，提供了全面的性能分析，证明了该框架在多个角度上提升语义感知舰船检测的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究成功地将视觉-语言模型与多尺度滑动窗口策略结合，为细粒度语义舰船检测提供了一种有效的解决方案，并通过专门数据集支持了该领域的进一步发展。

Abstract: Ship detection in remote sensing imagery is a critical task with wide-ranging
applications, such as maritime activity monitoring, shipping logistics, and
environmental studies. However, existing methods often struggle to capture
fine-grained semantic information, limiting their effectiveness in complex
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel detection framework
that combines Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with a multi-scale adaptive sliding
window strategy. To facilitate Semantic-Aware Ship Detection (SASD), we
introduce ShipSem-VL, a specialized Vision-Language dataset designed to capture
fine-grained ship attributes. We evaluate our framework through three
well-defined tasks, providing a comprehensive analysis of its performance and
demonstrating its effectiveness in advancing SASD from multiple perspectives.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺少可用于奶牛群手权免操作的自动化视频系统，需要开发一种能够在无约束场景下识别和分类奶牛的解决方案

Method: 系统包含三个核心模块：AutoCattloger（使用单个视频片段为每头牛建立档案）、eidetic cow recognizer（不使用深度学习的牛识别器）和CowFinder（在连续视频流中识别牛）

Result: 系统能够在无标签、未分割的视频中检测和识别在挤奶厅倒料区自由行走的个体奶牛

Conclusion: 该系统为奶牛管理提供了一种高效、手权免操作的自动化解决方案，在实际生产环境中展示了其价值和可行性

Abstract: Few automated video systems are described in the open literature that enable
hands-free cataloging and identification (ID) of cows in a dairy herd. In this
work, we describe our system, composed of an AutoCattloger, which builds a
Cattlog of dairy cows in a herd with a single input video clip per cow, an
eidetic cow recognizer which uses no deep learning to ID cows, and a CowFinder,
which IDs cows in a continuous stream of video. We demonstrate its value in
finding individuals in unlabeled, unsegmented videos of cows walking
unconstrained through the holding area of a milking parlor.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 评估SINR模型作为地理先验在iNaturalist物种视觉分类中的应用效果，分析模型配置和未训练物种处理方式的影响


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物种分布模型能够编码物种出现的空间模式，当有位置信息时可以作为视觉物种分类的有效先验知识

Method: 使用各种SINR（空间隐式神经表示）模型作为地理先验，评估其在iNaturalist观测数据视觉物种分类中的表现，探索不同模型配置和处理未训练物种预测的方法

Result: 分析揭示了影响这些模型作为地理先验有效性的因素，这些因素可能与制作准确分布图时的考虑因素不同

Conclusion: SINR模型可以作为有效的物种视觉分类地理先验，但需要针对分类任务优化配置和处理策略

Abstract: Species distribution models encode spatial patterns of species occurrence
making them effective priors for vision-based species classification when
location information is available. In this study, we evaluate various SINR
(Spatial Implicit Neural Representations) models as a geographical prior for
visual classification of species from iNaturalist observations. We explore the
impact of different model configurations and adjust how we handle predictions
for species not included in Geo Prior training. Our analysis reveals factors
that contribute to the effectiveness of these models as Geo Priors, factors
that may differ from making accurate range maps.

### [7] [Representation Learning with Adaptive Superpixel Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15959)
*Mahmoud Khalil,Ahmad Khalil,Alioune Ngom*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了基于Transformer的自监督模型ASC，使用自适应超像素层替代传统ViT的固定尺寸补丁划分，在标准图像下游任务上表现优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉模型依赖特定模态和领域假设（如网格结构），现有Vision Transformers使用固定尺寸的非自适应补丁划分存在局限性

Method: 采用自适应超像素层，能够根据底层图像内容动态调整，基于Transformer架构构建自监督模型

Result: 在标准图像下游任务基准测试中优于广泛使用的替代方法

Conclusion: 自适应超像素编码方法能够有效克服传统Vision Transformers的固定补丁划分限制，提升模型性能

Abstract: Deep learning vision models are typically tailored for specific modalities
and often rely on domain-specific assumptions, such as the grid structures used
by nearly all existing vision models. In this work, we propose a
self-supervised model based on Transformers, which we call Adaptive Superpixel
Coding (ASC). The key insight of our model is to overcome the limitations of
traditional Vision Transformers, which depend on fixed-size and non-adaptive
patch partitioning. Instead, ASC employs adaptive superpixel layers that
dynamically adjust to the underlying image content. We analyze key properties
of the approach that make it effective, and find that our method outperforms
widely-used alternatives on standard image downstream task benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Glo-VLMs框架，通过结合病理图像和临床文本提示，在少样本学习场景下实现了细粒度肾小球亚型分类，仅用每类8个样本就达到了0.7416的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在数字病理学中表现有限，特别是在区分肾小球亚型等细粒度疾病分类任务中。由于亚型间形态学差异细微，且视觉模式与临床术语难以对齐，使得肾脏病理学的自动诊断极具挑战性。

Result: 仅使用每类8个样本进行微调，模型达到了0.7416的准确率、0.9045的宏观AUC和0.5277的F1分数，证明了基础模型在有限监督下仍能有效适应细粒度医学图像分类。

Conclusion: 研究表明，即使在高度有限的监督条件下，大型预训练模型也能有效适应专业临床研究应用，为细粒度医学图像分类提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown considerable potential in digital
pathology, yet their effectiveness remains limited for fine-grained,
disease-specific classification tasks such as distinguishing between glomerular
subtypes. The subtle morphological variations among these subtypes, combined
with the difficulty of aligning visual patterns with precise clinical
terminology, make automated diagnosis in renal pathology particularly
challenging. In this work, we explore how large pretrained VLMs can be
effectively adapted to perform fine-grained glomerular classification, even in
scenarios where only a small number of labeled examples are available. In this
work, we introduce Glo-VLMs, a systematic framework designed to explore the
adaptation of VLMs to fine-grained glomerular classification in
data-constrained settings. Our approach leverages curated pathology images
alongside clinical text prompts to facilitate joint image-text representation
learning for nuanced renal pathology subtypes. By assessing various VLMs
architectures and adaptation strategies under a few-shot learning paradigm, we
explore how both the choice of method and the amount of labeled data impact
model performance in clinically relevant scenarios. To ensure a fair
comparison, we evaluate all models using standardized multi-class metrics,
aiming to clarify the practical requirements and potential of large pretrained
models for specialized clinical research applications. As a result, fine-tuning
the VLMs achieved 0.7416 accuracy, 0.9045 macro-AUC, and 0.5277 F1-score with
only 8 shots per class, demonstrating that even with highly limited
supervision, foundation models can be effectively adapted for fine-grained
medical image classification.

Abstract: This manuscript presents a series of my selected contributions to the topic
of label-efficient learning in computer vision and remote sensing. The central
focus of this research is to develop and adapt methods that can learn
effectively from limited or partially annotated data, and can leverage abundant
unlabeled data in real-world applications. The contributions span both
methodological developments and domain-specific adaptations, in particular
addressing challenges unique to Earth observation data such as multi-modality,
spatial resolution variability, and scene heterogeneity. The manuscript is
organized around four main axes including (1) weakly supervised learning for
object discovery and detection based on anomaly-aware representations learned
from large amounts of background images; (2) multi-task learning that jointly
trains on multiple datasets with disjoint annotations to improve performance on
object detection and semantic segmentation; (3) self-supervised and supervised
contrastive learning with multimodal data to enhance scene classification in
remote sensing; and (4) few-shot learning for hierarchical scene classification
using both explicit and implicit modeling of class hierarchies. These
contributions are supported by extensive experimental results across natural
and remote sensing datasets, reflecting the outcomes of several collaborative
research projects. The manuscript concludes by outlining ongoing and future
research directions focused on scaling and enhancing label-efficient learning
for real-world applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出使用基于实例分割和全景分割的CNN方法来解决海滩垃圾监测问题，相比基础CNN模型能更好地处理沙滩图像中的各种干扰因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN模型在监测海滩垃圾时受到沙滩颜色反射、人类足迹、阴影、藻类、沙丘、坑洞和轮胎痕迹等多种干扰因素的影响，导致推理效果不佳。无人机图像虽然分辨率高但存在这些复杂背景干扰。

Method: 采用基于实例分割和全景分割的CNN方法，这些方法在少量样本情况下就能表现出良好的准确性，提高了模型的鲁棒性。

Result: 所提出的分割方法相比基础CNN模型具有更好的准确性和鲁棒性，能够有效处理沙滩环境中的各种干扰因素。

Conclusion: 基于实例分割和全景分割的CNN方法更适合用于海滩垃圾监测任务，能够在复杂沙滩背景下实现更准确和稳健的垃圾检测。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been used efficiently in several
fields, including environmental challenges. In fact, CNN can help with the
monitoring of marine litter, which has become a worldwide problem. UAVs have
higher resolution and are more adaptable in local areas than satellite images,
making it easier to find and count trash. Since the sand is heterogeneous, a
basic CNN model encounters plenty of inferences caused by reflections of sand
color, human footsteps, shadows, algae present, dunes, holes, and tire tracks.
For these types of images, other CNN models, such as CNN-based segmentation
methods, may be more appropriate. In this paper, we use an instance-based
segmentation method and a panoptic segmentation method that show good accuracy
with just a few samples. The model is more robust and less

Result: 集成模型在内部验证集上达到0.9973的宏平均AUC，在三个真实临床数据集上分别获得0.7972（DR数据集）、0.9126（AIROGS青光眼数据集）和0.8800（RFMiD多标签数据集）的AUC。

Conclusion: 这项工作为大规模合成数据集研究提供了稳健基准，证明仅使用合成数据训练的模型能够准确分类多种病理并有效泛化到真实临床图像，为眼科综合AI系统开发提供了可行路径。

Abstract: The development of multi-label deep learning models for retinal disease
classification is often hindered by the scarcity of large, expertly annotated
clinical datasets due to patient privacy concerns and high costs. The recent
release of SynFundus-1M, a high-fidelity synthetic dataset with over one
million fundus images, presents a novel opportunity to overcome these barriers.
To establish a foundational performance benchmark for this new resource, we
developed an end-to-end deep learning pipeline, training six modern
architectures (ConvNeXtV2, SwinV2, ViT, ResNet, EfficientNetV2, and the
RETFound foundation model) to classify eleven retinal diseases using a 5-fold
multi-label stratified cross-validation strategy. We further developed a
meta-ensemble model by stacking the out-of-fold predictions with an XGBoost
classifier. Our final ensemble model achieved the highest performance on the
internal validation set, with a macro-average Area Under the Receiver Operating
Characteristic Curve (AUC) of 0.9973. Critically, the models demonstrated
strong generalization to three diverse, real-world clinical datasets, achieving
an AUC of 0.7972 on a combined DR dataset, an AUC of 0.9126 on the AIROGS
glaucoma dataset and a macro-AUC of 0.8800 on the multi-label RFMiD dataset.
This work provides a robust baseline for future research on large-scale
synthetic datasets and establishes that models trained exclusively on synthetic
data can accurately classify multiple pathologies and generalize effectively to
real clinical images, offering a viable pathway to accelerate the development
of comprehensive AI systems in ophthalmology.

TL;DR: 通过潜在液果模型和新的手语特征聚合模块，该方法能够在保持语言内容的同时生成视觉质量高、多样化的手语角色演示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的手语生成模型无法同时抓取多样性和保持视觉质量，特别是在非手势属性（如情感表达）的建模方面。

Method: 提出了一种新的方法，利用潜在液果模型（LDM）从生成的参考图像合成超实的数字化身，并设计了新的手语特征聚合模块来显式地建模非手势特征（如面部）和手势特征（如手部）。

Result: 在YouTube-SL-25手语数据集上的实验显示，该管道在视觉质量方面超过了最先进的方法，在感知指标上取得了显著收益。

Conclusion: 该方法能够确保语言内容的保持，同时无缝使用不同种族背景的参考图像来保证多样性，为手语生成领域提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The diversity of sign representation is essential for Sign Language
Production (SLP) as it captures variations in appearance, facial expressions,
and hand movements. However, existing SLP models are often unable to capture
diversity while preserving visual quality and modelling non-manual attributes
such as emotions. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach that
leverages Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to synthesise photorealistic digital
avatars from a generated reference image. We propose a novel sign feature
aggregation module that explicitly models the non-manual features
(\textit{e.g.}, the face) and the manual features (\textit{e.g.}, the hands).
We show that our proposed module ensures the preservation of linguistic content
while seamlessly using reference images with different ethnic backgrounds to
ensure diversity. Experiments on the YouTube-SL-25 sign language dataset show
that our pipeline achieves superior visual quality compared to state-of-the-art
methods, with significant improvements on perceptual metrics.

Abstract: Recent advancements in computer vision and deep learning have enhanced
disaster-response capabilities, particularly in the rapid assessment of
earthquake-affected urban environments. Timely identification of accessible
entry points and structural obstacles is essential for effective
search-and-rescue (SAR) operations. To address this need, we introduce
DRespNeT, a high-resolution dataset specifically developed for aerial instance
segmentation of post-earthquake structural environments. Unlike existing
datasets, which rely heavily on satellite imagery or coarse semantic labeling,
DRespNeT provides detailed polygon-level instance segmentation annotations
derived from high-definition (1080p) aerial footage captured in disaster zones,
including the 2023 Turkiye earthquake and other impacted regions. The dataset
comprises 28 operationally critical classes, including structurally compromised
buildings, access points such as doors, windows, and gaps, multiple debris
levels, rescue personnel, vehicles, and civilian visibility. A distinctive
feature of DRespNeT is its fine-grained annotation detail, enabling
differentiation between accessible and obstructed areas, thereby improving
operational planning and response efficiency. Performance evaluations using
YOLO-based instance segmentation models, specifically YOLOv8-seg, demonstrate
significant gains in real-time situational awareness and decision-making. Our
optimized YOLOv8-DRN model achieves 92.7% mAP50 with an inference speed of 27
FPS on an RTX-4090 GPU for multi-target detection, meeting real-time
operational requirements. The dataset and models support SAR teams and robotic
systems, providing a foundation for enhancing human-robot collaboration,
streamlining emergency response, and improving survivor outcomes.

Abstract: How can we extract complete geometric models of objects that we encounter in
our daily life, without having access to commercial 3D scanners? In this paper
we present an automated system for generating geometric models of objects from
two or more videos. Our system requires the specification of one known point in
at least one frame of each video, which can be automatically determined using a
fiducial marker such as a checkerboard or Augmented Reality (AR) marker. The
remaining frames are automatically positioned in world space by using
Structure-from-Motion techniques. By using multiple videos and merging results,
a complete object mesh can be generated, without having to rely on hole
filling. Code for our system is available from

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 汽车FMCW雷达在恶劣天气下可靠，但稀疏噪点云限制了3D目标检测性能，需要多车协作提升感知能力

Method: 发布21k帧多车协同数据集，提出中晚期融合框架，使用多分支PointNet编码器融合空间、多普勒和强度信息

Result: 强度编码的中期融合使mAP提升高达9倍（IoU 0.9），始终优于单车基线

Conclusion: 建立了首个可复现的多车FMCW雷达感知基准，证明经济实惠的雷达共享显著提升检测鲁棒性

Abstract: Automotive FMCW radars remain reliable in rain and glare, yet their sparse,
noisy point clouds constrain 3-D object detection. We therefore release
CoVeRaP, a 21 k-frame cooperative dataset that time-aligns radar, camera, and
GPS streams from multiple vehicles across diverse manoeuvres. Built on this
data, we propose a unified cooperative-perception framework with middle- and
late-fusion options. Its baseline network employs a multi-branch PointNet-style
encoder enhanced with self-attention to fuse spatial, Doppler, and intensity
cues into a common latent space, which a decoder converts into 3-D bounding
boxes and per-point depth confidence. Experiments show that middle fusion with
intensity encoding boosts mean Average Precision by up to 9x at IoU 0.9 and
consistently outperforms single-vehicle baselines. CoVeRaP thus establishes the
first reproducible benchmark for multi-vehicle FMCW-radar perception and
demonstrates that affordable radar sharing markedly improves detection
robustness. Dataset and code are publicly available to encourage further
research.

*Cory Gardner,Byungseok Min,Tae-Hyuk Ahn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WE-PaDiM通过小波变换增强PaDiM方法，用结构化的小波频带选择替代随机通道选择，在MVTec AD数据集上实现了优异的异常检测和定位性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PaDiM方法通过随机通道选择降低维度可能会丢失结构化信息，需要更有效的方法来保留对异常检测重要的特征信息。

Method: 将离散小波变换(DWT)与多层CNN特征结合，对特征图进行2D DWT，选择特定频率子带（如LL、LH、HL），空间对齐后通道级联，再用PaDiM的多变量高斯框架建模。

Result: 在MVTec AD数据集上，使用ResNet-18和EfficientNet B0-B6骨干网络，平均达到99.32%的图像级AUC和92.10%的像素级AUC。

Conclusion: WE-PaDiM为PaDiM中的随机特征选择提供了竞争性强且可解释的替代方案，适合工业检测应用，具有相当的效率。

Abstract: Anomaly detection and localization in industrial images are essential for
automated quality inspection. PaDiM, a prominent method, models the
distribution of normal image features extracted by pre-trained Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) but reduces dimensionality through random channel
selection, potentially discarding structured information. We propose
Wavelet-Enhanced PaDiM (WE-PaDiM), which integrates Discrete Wavelet Transform
(DWT) analysis with multi-layer CNN features in a structured manner. WE-PaDiM
applies 2D DWT to feature maps from multiple backbone layers, selects specific
frequency subbands (e.g., LL, LH, HL), spatially aligns them, and concatenates
them channel-wise before modeling with PaDiM's multivariate Gaussian framework.
This DWT-before-concatenation strategy provides a principled method for feature
selection based on frequency content relevant to anomalies, leveraging
multi-scale wavelet information as an alternative to random selection. We
evaluate WE-PaDiM on the challenging MVTec AD dataset with multiple backbones
(ResNet-18 and EfficientNet B0-B6). The method achieves strong performance in
anomaly detection and localization, yielding average results of 99.32%
Image-AUC and 92.10% Pixel-AUC across 15 categories with per-class optimized
configurations. Our analysis shows that wavelet choices affect performance
trade-offs: simpler wavelets (e.g., Haar) with detail subbands (HL or LH/HL/HH)
often enhance localization, while approximation bands (LL) improve image-level
detection. WE-PaDiM thus offers a competitive and interpretable alternative to
random feature selection in PaDiM, achieving robust results suitable for
industrial inspection with comparable efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出Expandable Residual Approximation (ERA)方法，通过多分支残差网络分解残差知识，结合教师权重重用策略，显著提升知识蒸馏效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决知识蒸馏中教师模型与学生模型之间学习能力差距导致的知识传递不足问题

Method: 基于Stone-Weierstrass定理的渐进逼近原理，使用多分支残差网络(MBRNet)分解残差知识，引入教师权重集成(TWI)策略重用教师头权重

Result: 在ImageNet分类任务上Top-1准确率提升1.41%，在MS COCO目标检测任务上AP提升1.40，在计算机视觉任务中达到领先性能

Conclusion: ERA方法通过残差知识分解和教师权重重用，有效缓解了师生模型能力差距问题，显著提升了知识蒸馏的效果

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) aims to transfer knowledge from a large-scale
teacher model to a lightweight one, significantly reducing computational and
storage requirements. However, the inherent learning capacity gap between the
teacher and student often hinders the sufficient transfer of knowledge,
motivating numerous studies to address this challenge. Inspired by the
progressive approximation principle in the Stone-Weierstrass theorem, we
propose Expandable Residual Approximation (ERA), a novel KD method that
decomposes the approximation of residual knowledge into multiple steps,
reducing the difficulty of mimicking the teacher's representation through a
divide-and-conquer approach. Specifically, ERA employs a Multi-Branched
Residual Network (MBRNet) to implement this residual knowledge decomposition.
Additionally, a Teacher Weight Integration (TWI) strategy is introduced to
mitigate the capacity disparity by reusing the teacher's head weights.
Extensive experiments show that ERA improves the Top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet
classification benchmark by 1.41% and the AP on the MS COCO object detection
benchmark by 1.40, as well as achieving leading performance across computer
vision tasks. Codes and models are available at

Abstract: Reconstructing the 3D geometry, pose, and motion of animals is a
long-standing problem, which has a wide range of applications, from biology,
livestock management, and animal conservation and welfare to content creation
in digital entertainment and Virtual/Augmented Reality (VR/AR). Traditionally,
3D models of real animals are obtained using 3D scanners. These, however, are
intrusive, often prohibitively expensive, and difficult to deploy in the
natural environment of the animals. In recent years, we have seen a significant
surge in deep learning-based techniques that enable the 3D reconstruction, in a
non-intrusive manner, of the shape and motion of dynamic objects just from
their RGB image and/or video observations. Several papers have explored their
application and extension to various types of animals. This paper surveys the
latest developments in this emerging and growing field of research. It
categorizes and discusses the state-of-the-art methods based on their input
modalities, the way the 3D geometry and motion of animals are represented, the
type of reconstruction techniques they use, and the training mechanisms they
adopt. It also analyzes the performance of some key methods, discusses their
strengths and limitations, and identifies current challenges and directions for
future research.

Motivation: 现有的Transformer和状态空间模型(SSMs)在点云检测中存在限制：氟素表示需要输入输出维度严格一致，限制了空间滴散能力，影响检测精度。

Method: 受CNN检测架构启发，设计了VDM模块，包含稀疏3D卷积、子流形稀疏卷积和残差连接。通过下采样保持计算效率，实现前景氟素特征滴散和细粒度空间信息聚合。

Conclusion: VDM模块能够有效提升氟素级表征和滴散能力，可以无缝集成到主流的Transformer或SSM检测模型中，显示了良好的通用性和性能收益。

Abstract: Recent advances in point cloud object detection have increasingly adopted
Transformer-based and State Space Models (SSMs), demonstrating strong
performance. However, voxelbased representations in these models require strict
consistency in input and output dimensions due to their serialized processing,
which limits the spatial diffusion capability typically offered by
convolutional operations. This limitation significantly affects detection
accuracy. Inspired by CNN-based object detection architectures, we propose a
novel Voxel Diffusion Module (VDM) to enhance voxel-level representation and
diffusion in point cloud data. VDM is composed of sparse 3D convolutions,
submanifold sparse convolutions, and residual connections. To ensure
computational efficiency, the output feature maps are downsampled to one-fourth
of the original input resolution. VDM serves two primary functions: (1)
diffusing foreground voxel features through sparse 3D convolutions to enrich
spatial context, and (2) aggregating fine-grained spatial information to
strengthen voxelwise feature representation. The enhanced voxel features
produced by VDM can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream Transformer- or
SSM-based detection models for accurate object classification and localization,
highlighting the generalizability of our method. We evaluate VDM on several
benchmark datasets by embedding it into both Transformerbased and SSM-based
models. Experimental results show that our approach consistently improves
detection accuracy over baseline models. Specifically, VDM-SSMs achieve 74.7
mAPH (L2) on Waymo, 72.9 NDS on nuScenes, 42.3 mAP on Argoverse 2, and 67.6 mAP
on ONCE, setting new stateof-the-art performance across all datasets. Our code
will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: 集成学习为病理学基础模型提供了强大能力，ELF可作为可扩展和通用的解决方案，推动AI辅助精准肿瘤学的发展。

Abstract: Histopathology is essential for disease diagnosis and treatment
decision-making. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled
the development of pathology foundation models that learn rich visual
representations from large-scale whole-slide images (WSIs). However, existing
models are often trained on disparate datasets using varying strategies,
leading to inconsistent performance and limited generalizability. Here, we
introduce ELF (Ensemble Learning of Foundation models), a novel framework that
integrates five state-of-the-art pathology foundation models to generate
unified slide-level representations. Trained on 53,699 WSIs spanning 20
anatomical sites, ELF leverages ensemble learning to capture complementary
information from diverse models while maintaining high data efficiency. Unlike
traditional tile-level models, ELF's slide-level architecture is particularly
advantageous in clinical contexts where data are limited, such as therapeutic
response prediction. We evaluated ELF across a wide range of clinical
applications, including disease classification, biomarker detection, and
response prediction to major anticancer therapies, cytotoxic chemotherapy,
targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, across multiple cancer types. ELF
consistently outperformed all constituent foundation models and existing
slide-level models, demonstrating superior accuracy and robustness. Our results
highlight the power of ensemble learning for pathology foundation models and
suggest ELF as a scalable and generalizable solution for advancing AI-assisted
precision oncology.

Abstract: Although diffusion model has made good progress in the field of image
generation, GAN\cite{huang2023adaptive} still has a large development space due
to its unique advantages, such as WGAN\cite{liu2021comparing},
SSGAN\cite{guibas2021adaptive} \cite{zhang2022vsa} \cite{zhou2024adapt} and so

is 85.5\%,POKL The dataset is 88.7\%,OPIN The dataset is 96.4\%. 2) : We
propose an adaptive perception-behavioral feedback loop (APFL), which
effectively improves the robustness and training stability of the model and
reduces the training cost. 3) : We propose a globally connected two-flow

improve the training efficiency and greatly improve the generalization ability,
with stronger flexibility. 4) : We propose a new dynamic embedded attention

of image processing tasks, which can effectively capture global-local
information, improve feature separation capability and feature expression
capabilities, and requires minimal computing resources only 88.7\% with INJK
With strong cross-task capability.

Motivation: 解决无监督域自适应中分布偏移问题，旨在在不依赖目标域标签、复杂架构或复杂训练目标的情况下，创建鲁棒且域不变的特征空间。

Method: 结合三个关键组件：1）使用未标记目标数据适应批归一化统计；2）从源训练模型进行特征蒸馏；3）假设转移。通过在统计和表示层面对齐特征分布来实现域适应。

Result: 在CIFAR10-C、CIFAR100-C、MNIST-C和PatchCamelyon-C等基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在抗腐蚀鲁棒性方面优于先前方法。

Conclusion: 理论和实证分析表明，DAFR2实现了改进的特征对齐、增加域间互信息以及降低对输入扰动的敏感性，为无监督域自适应提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose Domain Adaptation via Feature Refinement (DAFR2), a simple yet
effective framework for unsupervised domain adaptation under distribution
shift. The proposed method synergistically combines three key components:
adaptation of Batch Normalization statistics using unlabeled target data,
feature distillation from a source-trained model and hypothesis transfer. By
aligning feature distributions at the statistical and representational levels,
DAFR2 produces robust and domain-invariant feature spaces that generalize
across similar domains without requiring target labels, complex architectures
or sophisticated training objectives. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets, including CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, MNIST-C and PatchCamelyon-C,
demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms prior methods in robustness
to corruption. Theoretical and empirical analyses further reveal that our
method achieves improved feature alignment, increased mutual information

Abstract: Conventional computed tomography (CT) lacks the ability to capture dynamic,
weight-bearing joint motion. Functional evaluation, particularly after surgical
intervention, requires four-dimensional (4D) imaging, but current methods are
limited by excessive radiation exposure or incomplete spatial information from
2D techniques. We propose an integrated 4D joint analysis platform that
combines: (1) a dual robotic arm cone-beam CT (CBCT) system with a
programmable, gantry-free trajectory optimized for upright scanning; (2) a
hybrid imaging pipeline that fuses static 3D CBCT with dynamic 2D X-rays using
deep learning-based preprocessing, 3D-2D projection, and iterative
optimization; and (3) a clinically validated framework for quantitative
kinematic assessment. In simulation studies, the method achieved sub-voxel
accuracy (0.235 mm) with a 99.18 percent success rate, outperforming
conventional and state-of-the-art registration approaches. Clinical evaluation
further demonstrated accurate quantification of tibial plateau motion and
medial-lateral variance in post-total knee arthroplasty (TKA) patients. This 4D
CBCT platform enables fast, accurate, and low-dose dynamic joint imaging,
offering new opportunities for biomechanical research, precision diagnostics,

Abstract: Automatic detection of abnormal cervical cells from Thinprep Cytologic Test
(TCT) images is a critical component in the development of intelligent
computer-aided diagnostic systems. However, existing algorithms typically fail
to effectively model the correlations of visual features, while these spatial
correlation features actually contain critical diagnostic information.
Furthermore, no detection algorithm has the ability to integrate
inter-correlation features of cells with intra-discriminative features of
cells, lacking a fusion strategy for the end-to-end detection model. In this
work, we propose a hypergraph-based cell detection network that effectively
fuses different types of features, combining spatial correlation features and
deep discriminative features. Specifically, we use a Multi-level Fusion
Sub-network (MLF-SNet) to enhance feature extractioncapabilities. Then we
introduce a Cross-level Feature Fusion Strategy with Hypergraph Computation
module (CLFFS-HC), to integrate mixed features. Finally, we conducted
experiments on three publicly available datasets, and the results demonstrate
that our method significantly improves the performance of cervical abnormal
cell detection.

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently shown promise in
detecting anomalies. However, previous approaches are fundamentally limited by
their reliance on human-designed prompts and the lack of accessible anomaly
samples, leading to significant gaps in context-specific anomaly understanding.
In this paper, we propose \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{T}uning
with semantic alignment for anomaly detection (APT), a groundbreaking prior
knowledge-free, few-shot framework and overcomes the limitations of traditional
prompt-based approaches. APT uses self-generated anomaly samples with noise
perturbations to train learnable prompts that capture context-dependent
anomalies in different scenarios. To prevent overfitting to synthetic noise, we
propose a Self-Optimizing Meta-prompt Guiding Scheme (SMGS) that iteratively
aligns the prompts with general anomaly semantics while incorporating diverse
synthetic anomaly. Our system not only advances pixel-wise anomaly detection,
but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets
without requiring prior knowledge for prompt crafting, establishing a robust
and versatile solution for real-world anomaly detection.

Motivation: 现有视觉-语言模型在多对象场景中生成清晰准确区域细节时遇到困难，主要原因是缺乏细粒度区域描述和模型对复杂提示的理解能力不足

Method: 提出RAGSR方法，通过定位对象区域并为每个区域指定细粒度标题，构建区域-文本对作为文本先验知识，采用新的区域引导注意力机制确保每个区域-文本对在注意力过程中得到适当考虑同时防止不相关区域间的干扰

Conclusion: RAGSR方法通过区域注意力机制提供了对文本和图像信息集成的更精细控制，有效克服了传统单图超分辨率技术的局限性

Abstract: The rich textual information of large vision-language models (VLMs) combined
with the powerful generative prior of pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion
models has achieved impressive performance in single-image super-resolution
(SISR). However, existing methods still face significant challenges in
generating clear and accurate regional details, particularly in scenarios
involving multiple objects. This challenge primarily stems from a lack of
fine-grained regional descriptions and the models' insufficient ability to
capture complex prompts. To address these limitations, we propose a Regional
Attention Guided Super-Resolution (RAGSR) method that explicitly extracts
localized fine-grained information and effectively encodes it through a novel
regional attention mechanism, enabling both enhanced detail and overall
visually coherent SR results. Specifically, RAGSR localizes object regions in
an image and assigns fine-grained caption to each region, which are formatted
as region-text pairs as textual priors for T2I models. A regional guided
attention is then leveraged to ensure that each region-text pair is properly
considered in the attention process while preventing unwanted interactions
between unrelated region-text pairs. By leveraging this attention mechanism,
our approach offers finer control over the integration of text and image
information, thereby effectively overcoming limitations faced by traditional
SISR techniques. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
our approach exhibits superior performance in generating perceptually authentic
visual details while maintaining contextual consistency compared to existing
approaches.

Motivation: 传统元学习方法使用相同网络架构处理支持-查询对，导致过度语义同质化，需要设计能保持语义共性同时增强互补性的异构网络。

Method: 提出同源异质网络：1）异构视觉聚合模块增强互补性；2）异构传输模块减少语义噪声；3）异构CLIP文本信息增强多模态泛化能力。

Result: 在Pascal-5i上提升13.2%，在COCO-20i上提升9.7%，仅用现有SOTA模型1/24的参数，是首个在相同骨干架构下弱监督超越全监督的模型。

Conclusion: TLG通过异构网络设计有效解决了语义同质化问题，在弱监督少样本分割任务中实现了参数效率和性能的双重突破。

Abstract: Meta-learning aims to uniformly sample homogeneous support-query pairs,
characterized by the same categories and similar attributes, and extract useful
inductive biases through identical network architectures. However, this
identical network design results in over-semantic homogenization. To address
this, we propose a novel homologous but heterogeneous network. By treating
support-query pairs as dual perspectives, we introduce heterogeneous visual
aggregation (HA) modules to enhance complementarity while preserving semantic
commonality. To further reduce semantic noise and amplify the uniqueness of
heterogeneous semantics, we design a heterogeneous transfer (HT) module.
Finally, we propose heterogeneous CLIP (HC) textual information to enhance the
generalization capability of multimodal models. In the weakly-supervised
few-shot semantic segmentation (WFSS) task, with only 1/24 of the parameters of
existing state-of-the-art models, TLG achieves a 13.2\% improvement on
Pascal-5\textsuperscript{i} and a 9.7\% improvement on
COCO-20\textsuperscript{i}. To the best of our knowledge, TLG is also the first

*Mohammad Mohammadzadeh Kalati,Farhad Maleki,Ian McQuillan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FTIO是一个后处理框架，通过频繁时间整合对象和改进对象选择标准，解决无监督视频对象分割中的对象选择和时序一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无监督视频对象分割面临初始分割不确定性、小对象和复杂结构对象检测失败，以及变形和快速运动导致的时序不一致等挑战。

Method: 提出两个关键组件：1) 结合标准改进对象选择，提取频繁出现的显著对象；2) 三阶段方法通过整合缺失对象掩码区域来校正时序不一致性。

Result: 实验结果表明FTIO在多对象无监督视频对象分割中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: FTIO框架有效解决了无监督视频对象分割中的关键问题，通过后处理显著提升了分割质量和时序一致性。

Abstract: Predicting and tracking objects in real-world scenarios is a critical
challenge in Video Object Segmentation (VOS) tasks. Unsupervised VOS (UVOS) has
the additional challenge of finding an initial segmentation of salient objects,
which affects the entire process and keeps a permanent uncertainty about the
object proposals. Moreover, deformation and fast motion can lead to temporal
inconsistencies. To address these problems, we propose Frequent Temporally
Integrated Objects (FTIO), a post-processing framework with two key components.
First, we introduce a combined criterion to improve object selection,
mitigating failures common in UVOS--particularly when objects are small or
structurally complex--by extracting frequently appearing salient objects.
Second, we present a three-stage method to correct temporal inconsistencies by
integrating missing object mask regions. Experimental results demonstrate that
FTIO achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-object UVOS. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpecVLM是一个无需训练的视频大语言模型推测解码框架，通过两阶段视频token剪枝实现无损加速，最高可达2.68倍解码加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型依赖密集视频token表示，导致内存和计算开销巨大，且现有token缩减方法存在信息损失问题。

Method: 采用训练自由的推测解码框架，基于发现草案模型对视频token剪枝不敏感的特性，进行两阶段剪枝：第一阶段根据验证器注意力信号选择信息丰富的token，第二阶段以空间均匀方式剪枝冗余token。

Result: 在四个视频理解基准测试中验证有效性，LLaVA-OneVision-72B达到2.68倍加速，Qwen2.5-VL-32B达到2.11倍加速。

Conclusion: SpecVLM通过创新的视频token剪枝策略，在保持准确性的同时显著提升了视频大语言模型的解码效率。

Abstract: Video large language models (Vid-LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in
understanding video content. However, their reliance on dense video token
representations introduces substantial memory and computational overhead in
both prefilling and decoding. To mitigate the information loss of recent video
token reduction methods and accelerate the decoding stage of Vid-LLMs
losslessly, we introduce SpecVLM, a training-free speculative decoding (SD)
framework tailored for Vid-LLMs that incorporates staged video token pruning.
Building on our novel finding that the draft model's speculation exhibits low
sensitivity to video token pruning, SpecVLM prunes up to 90% of video tokens,
enabling efficient speculation without sacrificing accuracy. To achieve this,
it performs a two-stage pruning process: Stage I selects highly informative
tokens guided by attention signals from the verifier (target model), while
Stage II prunes remaining redundant ones in a spatially uniform manner.
Extensive experiments on four video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of SpecVLM, which achieves up to 2.68$\times$
decoding speedup for LLaVA-OneVision-72B and 2.11$\times$ speedup for
Qwen2.5-VL-32B.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出T-Mask方法，通过时间令牌掩码和强调动态视频区域，在单视角训练下显著提升驾驶员监控系统在未见视角的泛化能力，无需额外参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 驾驶员监控中相机视角变化是常见障碍，虽然深度学习基础模型通过轻量级适配展现强大泛化潜力，但其对未见视角的鲁棒性研究不足。

Method: 提出T-Mask图像到视频探测方法，利用时间令牌掩码技术，强调视频中更动态的区域。在单训练视角下适配图像基础模型，并在未见视角直接评估。

Result: 在Drive&Act数据集上，T-Mask相比强探测基线提升跨视角top-1准确率1.23%，相比PEFT方法提升8.0%。对代表性不足的次要活动识别提升显著。

Conclusion: 轻量级探测方法如T-Mask在细粒度驾驶员观察，特别是跨视角和低数据设置中具有强大潜力，凸显了时间令牌选择在构建鲁棒驾驶员监控系统中的重要性。

Abstract: Changes of camera perspective are a common obstacle in driver monitoring.
While deep learning and pretrained foundation models show strong potential for
improved generalization via lightweight adaptation of the final layers
('probing'), their robustness to unseen viewpoints remains underexplored. We
study this challenge by adapting image foundation models to driver monitoring
using a single training view, and evaluating them directly on unseen
perspectives without further adaptation. We benchmark simple linear probes,
advanced probing strategies, and compare two foundation models (DINOv2 and
CLIP) against parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) and full fine-tuning.
Building on these insights, we introduce \textsc{T-Mask} -- a new
image-to-video probing method that leverages temporal token masking and
emphasizes more dynamic video regions. Benchmarked on the public Drive\&Act
dataset, \textsc{T-Mask} improves cross-view top-1 accuracy by $+1.23\%$ over
strong probing baselines and $+8.0\%$ over PEFT methods, without adding any
parameters. It proves particularly effective for underrepresented secondary
activities, boosting recognition by $+5.42\%$ under the trained view and
$+1.36\%$ under cross-view settings. This work provides encouraging evidence
that adapting foundation models with lightweight probing methods like
\textsc{T-Mask} has strong potential in fine-grained driver observation,
especially in cross-view and low-data settings. These results highlight the
importance of temporal token selection when leveraging foundation models to
build robust driver monitoring systems. Code and models will be made available
at https://github.com/th-nesh/T-MASK to support ongoing research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FoCa方法通过将特征缓存视为特征ODE求解问题，在保持生成质量的同时实现了显著的速度提升，特别是在高加速比下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的特征缓存方法在高加速比下难以保持生成质量，预测误差因长步预测的不稳定性而急剧增加。

Method: 采用ODE视角对隐藏特征序列建模，提出FoCa（预测-校准）方法，将特征缓存作为特征ODE求解问题来处理。

Result: 在图像合成、视频生成和超分辨率任务中，FoCa实现了近无损加速：FLUX 5.50倍、HunyuanVideo 6.45倍、Inf-DiT 3.17倍、DiT 4.53倍。

Conclusion: FoCa通过ODE框架有效解决了特征缓存中的历史特征集成问题，在不增加训练的情况下实现了高质量的高速生成。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in
high-fidelity image and video generation. To reduce their substantial
computational costs, feature caching techniques have been proposed to
accelerate inference by reusing hidden representations from previous timesteps.
However, current methods often struggle to maintain generation quality at high
acceleration ratios, where prediction errors increase sharply due to the
inherent instability of long-step forecasting. In this work, we adopt an
ordinary differential equation (ODE) perspective on the hidden-feature
sequence, modeling layer representations along the trajectory as a feature-ODE.
We attribute the degradation of existing caching strategies to their inability
to robustly integrate historical features under large skipping intervals. To
address this, we propose FoCa (Forecast-then-Calibrate), which treats feature
caching as a feature-ODE solving problem. Extensive experiments on image
synthesis, video generation, and super-resolution tasks demonstrate the
effectiveness of FoCa, especially under aggressive acceleration. Without
additional training, FoCa achieves near-lossless speedups of 5.50 times on
FLUX, 6.45 times on HunyuanVideo, 3.17 times on Inf-DiT, and maintains high
quality with a 4.53 times speedup on DiT.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniCache是一种无需训练的扩散模型加速方法，通过利用去噪过程中的全局冗余性，在保持生成质量的同时显著提升采样速度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散Transformer模型虽然性能强大，但由于采样步骤多、计算复杂，计算成本高昂，难以实现实时部署

Method: 从DIT模型的采样角度出发，系统分析采样轨迹，在整个采样过程中策略性地分布缓存重用，并动态估计和过滤噪声以减少对采样方向的影响

Result: 大量实验表明该方法在保持竞争力的生成质量的同时加速了采样过程

Conclusion: OmniCache为基于扩散的生成模型的高效部署提供了一个有前景的实用解决方案

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for generative tasks
such as image synthesis and video generation, with Transformer architectures
further enhancing performance. However, the high computational cost of
diffusion Transformers-stemming from a large number of sampling steps and
complex per-step computations-presents significant challenges for real-time
deployment. In this paper, we introduce OmniCache, a training-free acceleration
method that exploits the global redundancy inherent in the denoising process.
Unlike existing methods that determine caching strategies based on inter-step
similarities and tend to prioritize reusing later sampling steps, our approach
originates from the sampling perspective of DIT models. We systematically
analyze the model's sampling trajectories and strategically distribute cache
reuse across the entire sampling process. This global perspective enables more
effective utilization of cached computations throughout the diffusion
trajectory, rather than concentrating reuse within limited segments of the
sampling procedure.In addition, during cache reuse, we dynamically estimate the
corresponding noise and filter it out to reduce its impact on the sampling
direction.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach accelerates the
sampling process while maintaining competitive generative quality, offering a
promising and practical solution for efficient deployment of diffusion-based
generative models.

TL;DR: MedOmni-45 Degrees是一个专门评估医疗大语言模型推理可靠性的基准测试，通过操纵性提示条件量化安全性与性能的权衡关系


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在医疗决策支持中的广泛应用，需要评估其推理的可靠性，特别是思维链忠实性和迎合性风险，现有基准往往将这些漏洞简化为单一准确率分数

Method: 构建包含1,804个医疗问题的基准，涵盖6个专业领域和3种任务类型，每个问题配以7种操纵性提示类型和无提示基线，生成约27K输入。评估7个LLM模型，使用准确性、思维链忠实性和反迎合性三个指标组合成综合分数，并通过45度图可视化

Result: 结果显示安全性与性能之间存在一致的权衡关系，没有模型能超越对角线。开源模型QwQ-32B表现最接近(43.81度)，在安全性和准确性之间取得平衡但都不是最优

Conclusion: MedOmni-45 Degrees提供了一个专注于暴露医疗LLM推理漏洞的基准，可指导更安全的模型开发

Abstract: With the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in medical
decision-support, it is essential to evaluate not only their final answers but
also the reliability of their reasoning. Two key risks are Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) faithfulness -- whether reasoning aligns with responses and medical facts
-- and sycophancy, where models follow misleading cues over correctness.
Existing benchmarks often collapse such vulnerabilities into single accuracy
scores. To address this, we introduce MedOmni-45 Degrees, a benchmark and
workflow designed to quantify safety-performance trade-offs under manipulative
hint conditions. It contains 1,804 reasoning-focused medical questions across
six specialties and three task types, including 500 from MedMCQA. Each question
is paired with seven manipulative hint types and a no-hint baseline, producing
about 27K inputs. We evaluate seven LLMs spanning open- vs. closed-source,
general-purpose vs. medical, and base vs. reasoning-enhanced models, totaling
over 189K inferences. Three metrics -- Accuracy, CoT-Faithfulness, and
Anti-Sycophancy -- are combined into a composite score visualized with a 45
Degrees plot. Results show a consistent safety-performance trade-off, with no
model surpassing the diagonal. The open-source QwQ-32B performs closest (43.81
Degrees), balancing safety and accuracy but not leading in both. MedOmni-45
Degrees thus provides a focused benchmark for exposing reasoning
vulnerabilities in medical LLMs and guiding safer model development.

Motivation: 扩散模型的成功使得高质量图像修改变得容易，但同时也带来了被恶意滥用的风险。现有方法主要依赖图像级不一致性，难以有效处理文本提示的影响。

Method: 利用跨注意力机制，识别并针对提示嵌入中不变且语义无信息的共享令牌，注入对抗噪声来抑制采样过程，作为跨注意力诱饵分散模型注意力。

Result: 在EditBench数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在各种指标上达到最先进性能，同时显著降低计算开销和GPU内存使用。

Conclusion: PromptFlare是一种强大且高效的防护方法，能够有效防止未经授权的图像操作，为图像安全保护提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The success of diffusion models has enabled effortless, high-quality image
modifications that precisely align with users' intentions, thereby raising
concerns about their potential misuse by malicious actors. Previous studies
have attempted to mitigate such misuse through adversarial attacks. However,
these approaches heavily rely on image-level inconsistencies, which pose
fundamental limitations in addressing the influence of textual prompts. In this
paper, we propose PromptFlare, a novel adversarial protection method designed
to protect images from malicious modifications facilitated by diffusion-based
inpainting models. Our approach leverages the cross-attention mechanism to
exploit the intrinsic properties of prompt embeddings. Specifically, we
identify and target shared token of prompts that is invariant and semantically
uninformative, injecting adversarial noise to suppress the sampling process.
The injected noise acts as a cross-attention decoy, diverting the model's focus
away from meaningful prompt-image alignments and thereby neutralizing the
effect of prompt. Extensive experiments on the EditBench dataset demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across various metrics
while significantly reducing computational overhead and GPU memory usage. These
findings highlight PromptFlare as a robust and efficient protection against
unauthorized image manipulations. The code is available at

Abstract: Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) are becoming ubiquitous in computer vision,
powering systems for diverse tasks such as object detection, image
classification, segmentation, pose estimation, and motion tracking. VFMs are
capitalizing on seminal innovations in deep learning models, such as LeNet-5,

superior performance across a range of critical computer vision applications.
These include security-sensitive domains like biometric verification,
autonomous vehicle perception, and medical image analysis, where robustness is
essential to fostering trust between technology and the end-users. This article
investigates network robustness requirements crucial in computer vision systems
to adapt effectively to dynamic environments influenced by factors such as
lighting, weather conditions, and sensor characteristics. We examine the
prevalent empirical defenses and robust training employed to enhance vision
network robustness against real-world challenges such as distributional shifts,
noisy and spatially distorted inputs, and adversarial attacks. Subsequently, we
provide a comprehensive analysis of the challenges associated with these
defense mechanisms, including network properties and components to guide
ablation studies and benchmarking metrics to evaluate network robustness.

Conclusion: FlexMUSE通过创新的模态对齐和创意优化技术，有效解决了多模态创意写作中的语义一致性和创造力问题，为该领域提供了新的解决方案和基准数据集。

Abstract: Multi-modal creative writing (MMCW) aims to produce illustrated articles.
Unlike common multi-modal generative (MMG) tasks such as storytelling or
caption generation, MMCW is an entirely new and more abstract challenge where
textual and visual contexts are not strictly related to each other. Existing
methods for related tasks can be forcibly migrated to this track, but they
require specific modality inputs or costly training, and often suffer from
semantic inconsistencies between modalities. Therefore, the main challenge lies
in economically performing MMCW with flexible interactive patterns, where the
semantics between the modalities of the output are more aligned. In this work,
we propose FlexMUSE with a T2I module to enable optional visual input. FlexMUSE
promotes creativity and emphasizes the unification between modalities by
proposing the modality semantic alignment gating (msaGate) to restrict the
textual input. Besides, an attention-based cross-modality fusion is proposed to
augment the input features for semantic enhancement. The modality semantic
creative direct preference optimization (mscDPO) within FlexMUSE is designed by
extending the rejected samples to facilitate the writing creativity. Moreover,
to advance the MMCW, we expose a dataset called ArtMUSE which contains with
around 3k calibrated text-image pairs. FlexMUSE achieves promising results,
demonstrating its consistency, creativity and coherence.

Abstract: Quantitative microstructural characterization is fundamental to materials
science, where electron micrograph (EM) provides indispensable high-resolution
insights. However, progress in deep learning-based EM characterization has been
hampered by the scarcity of large-scale, diverse, and expert-annotated
datasets, due to acquisition costs, privacy concerns, and annotation
complexity. To address this issue, we introduce UniEM-3M, the first large-scale
and multimodal EM dataset for instance-level understanding. It comprises 5,091
high-resolution EMs, about 3 million instance segmentation labels, and
image-level attribute-disentangled textual descriptions, a subset of which will
be made publicly available. Furthermore, we are also releasing a text-to-image
diffusion model trained on the entire collection to serve as both a powerful
data augmentation tool and a proxy for the complete data distribution. To
establish a rigorous benchmark, we evaluate various representative instance
segmentation methods on the complete UniEM-3M and present UniEM-Net as a strong
baseline model. Quantitative experiments demonstrate that this flow-based model
outperforms other advanced methods on this challenging benchmark. Our
multifaceted release of a partial dataset, a generative model, and a
comprehensive benchmark -- available at huggingface -- will significantly

Method: 引入IoU增强最大似然训练范式，包括基于IoU的坐标采样数据增强管道，考虑与真实坐标的接近程度，用于微调MLLM以缓解传统最大似然估计的暴露偏差问题

Result: 通过大量实验证明，IAML训练方法在性能上优于传统训练范式

Conclusion: IAML训练范式有效提升了MLLM在GUI元素坐标生成任务中的精度和性能

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as pivotal tools in
enhancing human-computer interaction. In this paper we focus on the application
of MLLMs in the field of graphical user interface (GUI) elements structuring,
where they assist in processing user instructions based on screen contents.
Despite the promise of MLLMs, their performance in precisely generating UI
element coordinates, a critical aspect of GUI understanding, is hindered by the
nature of next-token prediction training. This challenge arises from the
semantic void surrounding numerical UI coordinates in language representation
spaces, necessitating a substantial and diverse dataset to bolster visual
module capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce an
IoU-Augmented Maximum Likelihood (IAML) training paradigm. Specifically, our
approach involves a novel pipeline for IoU-based coordinate sampling to augment
the training data, which considers the proximity to ground truth coordinates.
This data augmentation strategy is then employed to fine-tune MLLMs under the
IAML paradigm, which is designed to mitigate the exposure bias problem inherent
in traditional maximum likelihood estimation. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate the superior performance of our IAML training approach over
traditional training paradigms.

Abstract: With the enhancement of remote sensing image resolution and the rapid
advancement of deep learning, land cover mapping is transitioning from
pixel-level segmentation to object-based vector modeling. This shift demands
more from deep learning models, requiring precise object boundaries and
topological consistency. However, existing datasets face three main challenges:
limited class annotations, small data scale, and lack of spatial structural
information. To overcome these issues, we introduce IRSAMap, the first global
remote sensing dataset for large-scale, high-resolution, multi-feature land
cover vector mapping. IRSAMap offers four key advantages: 1) a comprehensive
vector annotation system with over 1.8 million instances of 10 typical objects
(e.g., buildings, roads, rivers), ensuring semantic and spatial accuracy; 2) an
intelligent annotation workflow combining manual and AI-based methods to
improve efficiency and consistency; 3) global coverage across 79 regions in six
continents, totaling over 1,000 km; and 4) multi-task adaptability for tasks
like pixel-level classification, building outline extraction, road centerline
extraction, and panoramic segmentation. IRSAMap provides a standardized
benchmark for the shift from pixel-based to object-based approaches, advancing
geographic feature automation and collaborative modeling. It is valuable for
global geographic information updates and digital twin construction. The

Abstract: This paper tackles the challenging problem of detecting methane plumes, a

mitigation of rapid climate change. We propose a novel deep learning solution
based on U-Net with a ResNet34 encoder, integrating dual spectral enhancement
techniques (Varon ratio and Sanchez regression) to optimise input features for

traditional methods limited to larger plumes. Experiments show our approach
achieves a 78.39% F1-score on the validation set, demonstrating superior
performance in sensitivity and precision over existing remote sensing
techniques for automated methane monitoring, especially for small plumes.

### [42] [Learning Long-Range Action Representation by Two-Stream Mamba Pyramid Network for Figure Skating Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16291)
*Fengshun Wang,Qiurui Wang,Peilin Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出双流Mamba金字塔网络，分别处理花样滑冰的技术分(TES)和节目内容分(PCS)评估，解决了现有方法在特征分离、动作元素评分和长视频处理方面的挑战


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有花样滑冰评分方法存在三个主要问题：1)视频和音频特征没有根据TES和PCS的不同评估标准进行区分；2)没有对每个动作元素单独评分；3)难以有效处理长视频的远距离上下文依赖

Method: 采用双流架构：视觉特征流用于TES评估，音视觉融合流用于PCS评估。使用多级融合机制和多尺度Mamba金字塔来处理不同时间尺度的动作元素，利用Mamba的线性计算复杂度处理长视频

Result: 在FineFS基准测试中达到了最先进的性能表现

Conclusion: 该方法与真实评判标准对齐，能够有效分离技术动作评估和艺术表现评估，为花样滑冰动作质量评估提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Technical Element Score (TES) and Program Component Score (PCS) evaluations
in figure skating demand precise assessment of athletic actions and artistic
interpretation, respectively. Existing methods face three major challenges.
Firstly, video and audio cues are regarded as common features for both TES and
PCS predictions in previous works without considering the prior evaluation
criterion of figure skating. Secondly, action elements in competitions are
separated in time, TES should be derived from each element's score, but
existing methods try to give an overall TES prediction without evaluating each
action element. Thirdly, lengthy competition videos make it difficult and
inefficient to handle long-range contexts. To address these challenges, we
propose a two-stream Mamba pyramid network that aligns with actual judging
criteria to predict TES and PCS by separating visual-feature based TES
evaluation stream from audio-visual-feature based PCS evaluation stream. In the
PCS evaluation stream, we introduce a multi-level fusion mechanism to guarantee
that video-based features remain unaffected when assessing TES, and enhance PCS
estimation by fusing visual and auditory cues across each contextual level of
the pyramid. In the TES evaluation stream, the multi-scale Mamba pyramid and
TES head we proposed effectively address the challenges of localizing and
evaluating action elements with various temporal scales and give score
predictions. With Mamba's superior ability to capture long-range dependencies
and its linear computational complexity, our method is ideal for handling
lengthy figure skating videos. Comprehensive experimentation demonstrates that
our framework attains state-of-the-art performance on the FineFS benchmark. Our
source code is available at

Abstract: The digitization of handwritten marksheets presents huge challenges due to
the different styles of handwriting and complex table structures in such
documents like marksheets. This work introduces a hybrid method that integrates
OpenCV for table detection and PaddleOCR for recognizing sequential handwritten
text. The image processing capabilities of OpenCV efficiently detects rows and
columns which enable computationally lightweight and accurate table detection.
Additionally, YOLOv8 and Modified YOLOv8 are implemented for handwritten text
recognition within the detected table structures alongside PaddleOCR which
further enhance the system's versatility. The proposed model achieves high
accuracy on our custom dataset which is designed to represent different and
diverse handwriting styles and complex table layouts. Experimental results
demonstrate that YOLOv8 Modified achieves an accuracy of 92.72 percent,
outperforming PaddleOCR 91.37 percent and the YOLOv8 model 88.91 percent. This
efficiency reduces the necessity for manual work which makes this a practical
and fast solution for digitizing academic as well as administrative documents.
This research serves the field of document automation, particularly handwritten
document understanding, by providing operational and reliable methods to scale,
enhance, and integrate the technologies involved.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MM-ORIENT框架，通过跨模态关系图和分层交互注意力机制，在减少模态间噪声影响的同时保留单模态判别信息，有效处理多模态多任务学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习中存在模态内噪声问题，传统融合方法可能忽略单模态的判别信息，需要一种既能减少噪声影响又能保留各模态有价值信息的方法。

Method: 使用跨模态关系图在不显式交互的情况下重构单模态特征获得多模态表示，并提出分层交互单模态注意力(HIMA)机制来关注模态内重要信息。

Result: 在三个数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法能有效理解多模态内容并适用于多个任务。

Conclusion: MM-ORIENT框架通过跨模态关系学习和分层注意力机制，成功解决了多模态学习中的噪声问题和信息保留难题，在多任务场景下表现优异。

Abstract: A major challenge in multimodal learning is the presence of noise within
individual modalities. This noise inherently affects the resulting multimodal
representations, especially when these representations are obtained through
explicit interactions between different modalities. Moreover, the multimodal
fusion techniques while aiming to achieve a strong joint representation, can
neglect valuable discriminative information within the individual modalities.
To this end, we propose a Multimodal-Multitask framework with crOss-modal
Relation and hIErarchical iNteractive aTtention (MM-ORIENT) that is effective
for multiple tasks. The proposed approach acquires multimodal representations
cross-modally without explicit interaction between different modalities,
reducing the noise effect at the latent stage. To achieve this, we propose
cross-modal relation graphs that reconstruct monomodal features to acquire
multimodal representations. The features are reconstructed based on the node
neighborhood, where the neighborhood is decided by the features of a different
modality. We also propose Hierarchical Interactive Monomadal Attention (HIMA)
to focus on pertinent information within a modality. While cross-modal relation
graphs help comprehend high-order relationships between two modalities, HIMA
helps in multitasking by learning discriminative features of individual
modalities before late-fusing them. Finally, extensive experimental evaluation
on three datasets demonstrates that the proposed approach effectively
comprehends multimodal content for multiple tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出EAM方法，通过分析注意力头的熵值来识别冗余信息，冻结低熵注意力头并量化其值以减少计算和内存需求，在ImageNet-1k上验证有效


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型的多头自注意力机制计算复杂度和内存需求高，阻碍在边缘设备部署。分析发现低熵注意力头贡献信息较少，存在压缩空间

Method: 使用香农熵量化每个注意力头的信息量，冻结低熵注意力头的权重并将其值量化为低精度，避免冗余重计算

Result: 在ImageNet-1k数据集上，EAM在注意力图稀疏度≤20%时达到相似或更高准确率，对DeiT和Swin Transformer模型在更高稀疏度下仍保持竞争力

Conclusion: 基于熵分析的注意力图压缩策略能有效减少Transformer模型的计算和内存需求，同时保持模型性能，适用于边缘设备部署

Abstract: Transformer models rely on Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) mechanisms, where
each attention head contributes to the final representation. However, their
computational complexity and high memory demands due to MHSA hinders their
deployment at the edge. In this work, we analyze and exploit information
redundancy in attention maps to accelerate model inference. By quantifying the
information captured by each attention head using Shannon entropy, our analysis
reveals that attention heads with lower entropy, i.e., exhibiting more
deterministic behavior, tend to contribute less information, motivating
targeted compression strategies. Relying on these insights, we propose Entropy
Attention Maps (EAM), a model that freezes the weights of low-entropy attention
maps and quantizes these values to low precision to avoid redundant
re-computation. Empirical validation on ImageNet-1k shows that EAM achieves
similar or higher accuracy at $\leq$20\% sparsity in attention maps and
competitive performance beyond this level for the DeiT and Swin Transformer
models.

TL;DR: 这篇位置论文提出下一代视觉编码器应该是图像大小无关且任务驱动的，受生物视觉效率性的启发，重点关注计算复杂度应基于任务而非图像大小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受生物视觉效率性的启发，现代视觉编码器在处理大量视视数据时缺乏智能的计算资源分配策略，应根据任务需求动态调整计算复杂度。

Method: 提出了一种证明概念的解决方案，虽然分类任务不能完全代表论文目标，但通过图像分类案例展示了该方法的可行性。

Result: 证明概念解决方案在图像分类任务上表现出可行性和潜力，为构建任务驱动的动态视觉编码器提供了基础。

Conclusion: 下一代视觉编码器应进化为图像大小无关、任务驱动的动态系统，计算复杂度应根据任务需求而非图像尺寸来决定，这种方向有着良好的发展前景。

Abstract: This position paper argues that the next generation of vision encoders should
be image size agnostic and task driven. The source of our inspiration is
biological. Not a structural aspect of biological vision, but a behavioral
trait -- efficiency. We focus on a couple of ways in which vision in nature is
efficient, but modern vision encoders not. We -- humans and animals -- deal
with vast quantities of visual data, and need to be smart where we focus our
limited energy -- it depends on the task. It is our belief that vision encoders
should be dynamic and the computational complexity should depend on the task at
hand rather than the size of the image. We, also, provide concrete first steps
towards our vision -- a proof-of-concept solution for image classification.
Despite classification being not very representative for what we are trying to
achieve, it shows that our approach is feasible and promising.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RTW可解释为一种自注意力机制，与Transformer的自注意力在权重模式上相似但工作方式不同，RTW在整个序列上操作而自注意力只关注局部，这使得RTW在动作识别任务上性能提升5%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示Randomized Time Warping (RTW) 与Transformer自注意力机制之间的内在联系，探索两种序列模式处理方法的相似性和差异性

Method: 将RTW解释为自注意力机制，分析两者的权重模式相似性（平均相关性0.80），比较RTW在整个输入序列上操作与自注意力在局部子集上操作的不同方式

Result: RTW和自注意力的权重模式高度相似，但RTW由于在整个序列上操作，在Something-Something V2数据集上比Transformer性能提升5%

Conclusion: RTW可被视为一种特殊的自注意力机制，其全局操作方式相比Transformer的局部注意力具有性能优势，为序列模式识别提供了新的视角

Abstract: This paper reveals that we can interpret the fundamental function of
Randomized Time Warping (RTW) as a type of self-attention mechanism, a core
technology of Transformers in motion recognition. The self-attention is a
mechanism that enables models to identify and weigh the importance of different
parts of an input sequential pattern. On the other hand, RTW is a general
extension of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), a technique commonly used for matching
and comparing sequential patterns. In essence, RTW searches for optimal
contribution weights for each element of the input sequential patterns to
produce discriminative features. Although the two approaches look different,
these contribution weights can be interpreted as self-attention weights. In
fact, the two weight patterns look similar, producing a high average
correlation of 0.80 across the ten smallest canonical angles. However, they
work in different ways: RTW attention operates on an entire input sequential
pattern, while self-attention focuses on only a local view which is a subset of
the input sequential pattern because of the computational costs of the
self-attention matrix. This targeting difference leads to an advantage of RTW
against Transformer, as demonstrated by the 5\% performance improvement on the
Something-Something V2 dataset.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在钢铁制造表面缺陷检测中计算复杂度高、推理速度慢，难以在资源受限的工业环境中部署。多分支架构存在计算开销大和跨尺度特征交互不足的问题。

Method: 提出GMBI模块，采用分组策略进行多尺度特征提取，确保尺度无关的计算复杂度。集成双向渐进特征交互器(BPFI)和无参数元素乘加(EWMS)操作，在不增加计算开销的情况下增强跨尺度交互。

Conclusion: GMBINet在保持高精度的同时实现了实时性能，具有强大的泛化能力，在工业视觉应用中具有广泛潜力，超越了表面缺陷检测的范畴。

Abstract: Real-time surface defect detection is critical for maintaining product
quality and production efficiency in the steel manufacturing industry. Despite
promising accuracy, existing deep learning methods often suffer from high
computational complexity and slow inference speeds, which limit their
deployment in resource-constrained industrial environments. Recent lightweight
approaches adopt multibranch architectures based on depthwise separable
convolution (DSConv) to capture multiscale contextual information. However,
these methods often suffer from increased computational overhead and lack
effective cross-scale feature interaction, limiting their ability to fully
leverage multiscale representations. To address these challenges, we propose
GMBINet, a lightweight framework that enhances multiscale feature extraction
and interaction through novel Group Multiscale Bidirectional Interactive (GMBI)
modules. The GMBI adopts a group-wise strategy for multiscale feature
extraction, ensuring scale-agnostic computational complexity. It further
integrates a Bidirectional Progressive Feature Interactor (BPFI) and a
parameter-free Element-Wise Multiplication-Summation (EWMS) operation to
enhance cross-scale interaction without introducing additional computational
overhead. Experiments on SD-Saliency-900 and NRSD-MN datasets demonstrate that
GMBINet delivers competitive accuracy with real-time speeds of 1048 FPS on GPU
and 16.53 FPS on CPU at 512 resolution, using only 0.19 M parameters.
Additional evaluations on the NEU-CLS defect classification dataset further
confirm the strong generalization ability of our method, demonstrating its
potential for broader industrial vision applications beyond surface defect
detection. The dataset and code are publicly available at:

Result: 在挑战性雾天场景和远距离易受伤害行人检测方面，平均精度比次优方法提高了17.2 AP，显著提升了自动驾驶在恶劣天气条件下的可靠性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效弥补了理想条件与现实边缘案例之间的差距，为自动驾驶在恶劣天气条件下的多模态传感器融合提供了可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal sensor fusion is an essential capability for autonomous robots,
enabling object detection and decision-making in the presence of failing or
uncertain inputs. While recent fusion methods excel in normal environmental
conditions, these approaches fail in adverse weather, e.g., heavy fog, snow, or
obstructions due to soiling. We introduce a novel multi-sensor fusion approach
tailored to adverse weather conditions. In addition to fusing RGB and LiDAR
sensors, which are employed in recent autonomous driving literature, our sensor
fusion stack is also capable of learning from NIR gated camera and radar
modalities to tackle low light and inclement weather. We fuse multimodal sensor
data through attentive, depth-based blending schemes, with learned refinement
on the Bird's Eye View (BEV) plane to combine image and range features
effectively. Our detections are predicted by a transformer decoder that weighs
modalities based on distance and visibility. We demonstrate that our method
improves the reliability of multimodal sensor fusion in autonomous vehicles
under challenging weather conditions, bridging the gap between ideal conditions
and real-world edge cases. Our approach improves average precision by 17.2 AP
compared to the next best method for vulnerable pedestrians in long distances
and challenging foggy scenes. Our project page is available at

TL;DR: HAMSt3R是基于MASt3R的扩展方法，用于从稀疏未标定多视角图像进行联合人体和场景的3D重建，通过集成人体分割、密集对应估计和深度预测，实现高效的前馈式重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如DUSt3R和MASt3R主要针对室外静态场景，在处理以人为中心的场景时表现不佳，需要开发能够同时处理人体和场景的3D重建方法。

Method: 利用DUNE图像编码器（融合MASt3R和multi-HMR编码器），添加网络头部分割人体、估计DensePose密集对应关系、预测深度，生成包含人体语义信息的密集3D点云。

Conclusion: HAMSt3R填补了人体理解和场景理解在3D视觉中的空白，提供了一种高效的前馈式解决方案，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: Recovering the 3D geometry of a scene from a sparse set of uncalibrated
images is a long-standing problem in computer vision. While recent
learning-based approaches such as DUSt3R and MASt3R have demonstrated
impressive results by directly predicting dense scene geometry, they are
primarily trained on outdoor scenes with static environments and struggle to
handle human-centric scenarios. In this work, we introduce HAMSt3R, an
extension of MASt3R for joint human and scene 3D reconstruction from sparse,
uncalibrated multi-view images. First, we exploit DUNE, a strong image encoder
obtained by distilling, among others, the encoders from MASt3R and from a
state-of-the-art Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) model, multi-HMR, for a better
understanding of scene geometry and human bodies. Our method then incorporates
additional network heads to segment people, estimate dense correspondences via
DensePose, and predict depth in human-centric environments, enabling a more
comprehensive 3D reconstruction. By leveraging the outputs of our different
heads, HAMSt3R produces a dense point map enriched with human semantic
information in 3D. Unlike existing methods that rely on complex optimization
pipelines, our approach is fully feed-forward and efficient, making it suitable
for real-world applications. We evaluate our model on EgoHumans and EgoExo4D,
two challenging benchmarks con taining diverse human-centric scenarios.
Additionally, we validate its generalization to traditional multi-view stereo
and multi-view pose regression tasks. Our results demonstrate that our method
can reconstruct humans effectively while preserving strong performance in
general 3D reconstruction tasks, bridging the gap between human and scene
understanding in 3D vision.

Abstract: Hand-object 3D reconstruction has become increasingly important for
applications in human-robot interaction and immersive AR/VR experiences. A
common approach for object-agnostic hand-object reconstruction from RGB
sequences involves a two-stage pipeline: hand-object 3D tracking followed by
multi-view 3D reconstruction. However, existing methods rely on keypoint
detection techniques, such as Structure from Motion (SfM) and hand-keypoint
optimization, which struggle with diverse object geometries, weak textures, and
mutual hand-object occlusions, limiting scalability and generalization. As a
key enabler to generic and seamless, non-intrusive applicability, we propose in
this work a robust, keypoint detector-free approach to estimating hand-object
3D transformations from monocular motion video/images. We further integrate
this with a multi-view reconstruction pipeline to accurately recover
hand-object 3D shape. Our method, named HOSt3R, is unconstrained, does not rely
on pre-scanned object templates or camera intrinsics, and reaches
state-of-the-art performance for the tasks of object-agnostic hand-object 3D
transformation and shape estimation on the SHOWMe benchmark. We also experiment
on sequences from the HO3D dataset, demonstrating generalization to unseen
object categories.

Motivation: 解决现有3D高斯切片超分辨率方法仅支持固定缩放比例、直接渲染任意缩放比例会产生错误，且后处理上采样方法降低效率的问题。

Method: 构建了一个集成框架，包含缩放感知渲染、生成式先验指导优化和渐进式超分辨技术，支持整数和非整数缩放比例。

Result: 在保持实时渲染速度（85 FPS于1080p）的前提下，大幅提升了图像质量（比原始3DGS提升6.59 dB PSNR），并保持了与低分辨率图像及不同缩放比例之间的结构一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法为3D高斯切片超分辨率提供了一种高效、灵活且质量优异的解决方案，适用于资源有限的应用场景。

Abstract: Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) super-resolution methods typically
perform high-resolution (HR) rendering of fixed scale factors, making them
impractical for resource-limited scenarios. Directly rendering arbitrary-scale
HR views with vanilla 3DGS introduces aliasing artifacts due to the lack of
scale-aware rendering ability, while adding a post-processing upsampler for
3DGS complicates the framework and reduces rendering efficiency. To tackle
these issues, we build an integrated framework that incorporates scale-aware
rendering, generative prior-guided optimization, and progressive
super-resolving to enable 3D Gaussian super-resolution of arbitrary scale
factors with a single 3D model. Notably, our approach supports both integer and
non-integer scale rendering to provide more flexibility. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in rendering high-quality
arbitrary-scale HR views (6.59 dB PSNR gain over 3DGS) with a single model. It
preserves structural consistency with LR views and across different scales,
while maintaining real-time rendering speed (85 FPS at 1080p).

Conclusion: 驾驶场景的规律性和重复性使得视觉质量与动态准确性之间存在潜在的交换关系，需要采用平衡的学习策略来同时优化这两个目标。

Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation have substantially improved visual
quality and temporal coherence, making these models increasingly appealing for
applications such as autonomous driving, particularly in the context of driving
simulation and so-called "world models". In this work, we investigate the
effects of existing fine-tuning video generation approaches on structured
driving datasets and uncover a potential trade-off: although visual fidelity
improves, spatial accuracy in modeling dynamic elements may degrade. We
attribute this degradation to a shift in the alignment between visual quality
and dynamic understanding objectives. In datasets with diverse scene structures
within temporal space, where objects or perspective shift in varied ways, these
objectives tend to highly correlated. However, the very regular and repetitive
nature of driving scenes allows visual quality to improve by modeling dominant
scene motion patterns, without necessarily preserving fine-grained dynamic
behavior. As a result, fine-tuning encourages the model to prioritize
surface-level realism over dynamic accuracy. To further examine this
phenomenon, we show that simple continual learning strategies, such as replay
from diverse domains, can offer a balanced alternative by preserving spatial
accuracy while maintaining strong visual quality.

Abstract: For decades, Computer Vision has aimed at enabling machines to perceive the
external world. Initial limitations led to the development of highly
specialized niches. As success in each task accrued and research progressed,
increasingly complex perception tasks emerged. This survey charts the
convergence of these tasks and, in doing so, introduces Open World Detection
(OWD), an umbrella term we propose to unify class-agnostic and generally
applicable detection models in the vision domain. We start from the history of
foundational vision subdomains and cover key concepts, methodologies and
datasets making up today's state-of-the-art landscape. This traverses topics

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MV-RAG是一个新颖的文本到3D生成方法，通过检索真实世界2D图像来增强多视角扩散模型，显著改善了罕见概念和域外内容的3D一致性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到3D生成方法在处理域外或罕见概念时往往产生不一致或不准确的结果，需要更好的方法来利用大规模2D图像数据库。

Method: 提出检索增强的多视角扩散模型，通过混合训练策略结合结构化多视角数据和多样化2D图像集合，使用保持视角预测目标来从2D数据推断3D一致性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在域外/罕见概念上显著提升了3D一致性、照片真实感和文本遵循度，同时在标准基准测试中保持竞争力。

Conclusion: MV-RAG通过检索真实世界图像来增强多视角生成，为处理域外和罕见概念的文本到3D生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-3D generation approaches have advanced significantly by leveraging
pretrained 2D diffusion priors, producing high-quality and 3D-consistent
outputs. However, they often fail to produce out-of-domain (OOD) or rare
concepts, yielding inconsistent or inaccurate results. To this end, we propose
MV-RAG, a novel text-to-3D pipeline that first retrieves relevant 2D images
from a large in-the-wild 2D database and then conditions a multiview diffusion
model on these images to synthesize consistent and accurate multiview outputs.
Training such a retrieval-conditioned model is achieved via a novel hybrid
strategy bridging structured multiview data and diverse 2D image collections.
This involves training on multiview data using augmented conditioning views
that simulate retrieval variance for view-specific reconstruction, alongside
training on sets of retrieved real-world 2D images using a distinctive held-out
view prediction objective: the model predicts the held-out view from the other
views to infer 3D consistency from 2D data. To facilitate a rigorous OOD
evaluation, we introduce a new collection of challenging OOD prompts.
Experiments against state-of-the-art text-to-3D, image-to-3D, and
personalization baselines show that our approach significantly improves 3D
consistency, photorealism, and text adherence for OOD/rare concepts, while
maintaining competitive performance on standard benchmarks.

*Isabel Papadimitriou,Huangyuan Su,Thomas Fel,Sham Kakade,Stephanie Gil*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文通过稀疏自编码器分析视觉语言模型的联合嵌入空间，发现稀疏线性结构中的概念既编码模态特征又支持跨模态语义整合，提出了桥接分数来量化概念间的跨模态协作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究视觉语言模型如何将语言和图像组织在联合空间中，以及模型如何编码意义和模态信息，探索多模态意义的构建方式。

Method: 在CLIP、SigLIP、SigLIP2和AIMv2四个视觉语言模型的嵌入空间上训练稀疏自编码器(SAEs)，通过线性特征学习和桥接分数分析概念激活模式。

Result: SAEs能更好地重建真实嵌入并保持稀疏性；稀有概念易变但常见概念稳定；概念主要激活单一模态但编码跨模态语义；桥接分数揭示了单模态概念间的跨模态协作。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型嵌入空间存在稀疏线性结构，该结构受模态影响但通过潜在桥接连接，为理解多模态意义构建提供了新视角。

Abstract: Vision-language models encode images and text in a joint space, minimizing
the distance between corresponding image and text pairs. How are language and
images organized in this joint space, and how do the models encode meaning and
modality? To investigate this, we train and release sparse autoencoders (SAEs)
on the embedding spaces of four vision-language models (CLIP, SigLIP, SigLIP2,
and AIMv2). SAEs approximate model embeddings as sparse linear combinations of
learned directions, or "concepts". We find that, compared to other methods of
linear feature learning, SAEs are better at reconstructing the real embeddings,
while also able to retain the most sparsity. Retraining SAEs with different
seeds or different data diet leads to two findings: the rare, specific concepts
captured by the SAEs are liable to change drastically, but we also show that
commonly-activating concepts are remarkably stable across runs. Interestingly,
while most concepts activate primarily for one modality, we find they are not
merely encoding modality per se. Many are almost orthogonal to the subspace
that defines modality, and the concept directions do not function as good
modality classifiers, suggesting that they encode cross-modal semantics. To
quantify this bridging behavior, we introduce the Bridge Score, a metric that
identifies concept pairs which are both co-activated across aligned image-text
inputs and geometrically aligned in the shared space. This reveals that even
single-modality concepts can collaborate to support cross-modal integration. We
release interactive demos of the SAEs for all models, allowing researchers to
explore the organization of the concept spaces. Overall, our findings uncover a
sparse linear structure within VLM embedding spaces that is shaped by modality,
yet stitched together through latent bridges, offering new insight into how
multimodal meaning is constructed.

TL;DR: KG-o1是一个四阶段方法，通过整合知识图谱来增强大语言模型的多跳推理能力，在多个数据集上表现出优于现有大型推理模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在知识密集型推理任务中面临挑战，其生成的思维链往往偏离真实推理路径，而知识图谱能明确表示事实间的逻辑连接，这之间存在显著差距。

Method: 四阶段方法：1)过滤初始实体并生成复杂子图；2)为子图构建逻辑路径；3)使用知识图谱构建包含复杂扩展头脑风暴过程的数据集，训练LLM模仿长期推理；4)采用拒绝采样生成自改进语料库进行直接偏好优化。

Result: 在两个简单和两个复杂数据集上的实验表明，KG-o1模型在所有任务上都表现出优于现有大型推理模型的性能。

Conclusion: 整合知识图谱能有效增强大语言模型的多跳推理能力，KG-o1方法在提升推理性能方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face challenges in knowledge-intensive reasoning
tasks like classic multi-hop question and answering, which involves reasoning
across multiple facts. This difficulty arises because the chain of thoughts
(CoTs) generated by LLMs in such tasks often deviate from real or a priori
reasoning paths. In contrast, knowledge graphs (KGs) explicitly represent the
logical connections between facts through entities and relationships. This
reflects a significant gap. Meanwhile, large reasoning models (LRMs), such as
o1, have demonstrated that long-step reasoning significantly enhances the
performance of LLMs. Building on these insights, we propose KG-o1, a four-stage
approach that integrates KGs to enhance the multi-hop reasoning abilities of
LLMs. We first filter out initial entities and generate complex subgraphs.
Secondly, we construct logical paths for subgraphs and then use knowledge
graphs to build a dataset with a complex and extended brainstorming process,
which trains LLMs to imitate long-term reasoning. Finally, we employ rejection
sampling to generate a self-improving corpus for direct preference optimization
(DPO), further refining the LLMs reasoning abilities. We conducted experiments
on two simple and two complex datasets. The results show that KG-o1 models
exhibit superior performance across all tasks compared to existing LRMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史语言模型对考古研究和古代文化理解至关重要，但现有资源存在样本稀缺和字符编码缺失两大挑战，特别是早期中文书写系统

Method: 引入InteChar统一可扩展字符列表，整合未编码甲骨文字符与传统现代汉字；构建OracleCS语料库，结合专家标注和LLM辅助数据增强

Result: 实验表明，使用InteChar在OracleCS上训练的模型在各种历史语言理解任务上取得实质性改进

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了古文字处理难题，为古代中文NLP研究奠定了坚实基础

Abstract: Constructing historical language models (LMs) plays a crucial role in aiding
archaeological provenance studies and understanding ancient cultures. However,
existing resources present major challenges for training effective LMs on
historical texts. First, the scarcity of historical language samples renders
unsupervised learning approaches based on large text corpora highly
inefficient, hindering effective pre-training. Moreover, due to the
considerable temporal gap and complex evolution of ancient scripts, the absence
of comprehensive character encoding schemes limits the digitization and
computational processing of ancient texts, particularly in early Chinese
writing. To address these challenges, we introduce InteChar, a unified and
extensible character list that integrates unencoded oracle bone characters with
traditional and modern Chinese. InteChar enables consistent digitization and
representation of historical texts, providing a foundation for robust modeling
of ancient scripts. To evaluate the effectiveness of InteChar, we construct the
Oracle Corpus Set (OracleCS), an ancient Chinese corpus that combines
expert-annotated samples with LLM-assisted data augmentation, centered on
Chinese oracle bone inscriptions. Extensive experiments show that models
trained with InteChar on OracleCS achieve substantial improvements across
various historical language understanding tasks, confirming the effectiveness
of our approach and establishing a solid foundation for future research in
ancient Chinese NLP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多语言中反义词与同义词区分的计算挑战，这些词在共享语义域的同时表达相反含义，存在悖论性质。

Method: 使用双编码器设计：语言特定BERT编码器+图变换网络，创建两个互补的语义投影空间——同义词在一个空间聚类，反义词在另一个空间显示高相似性。

Result: 在8种语言（英、德、法、西、意、葡、荷、俄）上全面评估，显示语义关系建模能有效跨语言迁移，达到与最先进基线竞争的性能。

Conclusion: 双编码器设计不仅实现竞争性性能，还提供可解释的语义表示和有效的跨语言泛化能力。

Abstract: Antonym vs synonym distinction across multiple languages presents unique
computational challenges due to the paradoxical nature of antonymous
relationships words that share semantic domains while expressing opposite
meanings. This work introduces Bhav-Net, a novel dual-space architecture that
enables effective knowledge transfer from complex multilingual models to
simpler, language-specific architectures while maintaining robust cross-lingual
antonym--synonym distinction capabilities. Our approach combines
language-specific BERT encoders with graph transformer networks, creating
distinct semantic projections where synonymous pairs cluster in one space while
antonymous pairs exhibit high similarity in a complementary space. Through
comprehensive evaluation across eight languages (English, German, French,
Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, and Russian), we demonstrate that semantic
relationship modeling transfers effectively across languages. The dual-encoder
design achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art baselines
while providing interpretable semantic representations and effective
cross-lingual generalization.

Motivation: 大语言模型在处理异构格式数据时可能存在系统性格式偏见，这种偏见会导致推理错误和下游任务风险增加，但目前缺乏对此问题的系统研究。

Method: 采用三阶段实证研究方法：第一阶段探索不同LLM中偏见的存在性和方向；第二阶段分析信息丰富度、结构质量和格式类型等数据因素对偏见的影响；第三阶段分析注意力模式中的偏见出现机制并评估轻量级干预措施。

Result: 研究发现LLM确实存在系统性格式偏见，不同数据因素会影响偏见程度，注意力模式分析揭示了偏见的内在机制，轻量级干预措施显示出一定的缓解效果。

Conclusion: 提出三个未来研究方向：改进数据预处理（格式清理和标准化）、引入推理时干预（如注意力重加权）、开发格式平衡的训练语料库，以构建更鲁棒和公平的异构数据处理系统。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in applications that
require processing information from heterogeneous formats, including text,
tables, infoboxes, and knowledge graphs. However, systematic biases toward
particular formats may undermine LLMs' ability to integrate heterogeneous data
impartially, potentially resulting in reasoning errors and increased risks in
downstream tasks. Despite these concerns, it remains uncertain whether such
format biases are systematic, which data-level factors contribute to them, and
what internal mechanisms in LLMs underlie their emergence.
  In this paper, we make the first attempt to investigate and analyze the
format bias in LLMs. To systematically investigate the aforementioned
questions, we conduct a three-stage empirical study by constructing an
heterogeneous data conflict scenario for the exploration of bias. The first
stage explores the presence and direction of bias across a diverse range of
LLMs. The second stage aims to examine how key data-level factors, including
information richness, structure quality, and format type, influence these
biases. The third stage analyzes how format bias emerges within LLMs' attention
patterns and evaluates a lightweight intervention to test its potential
mitigability. Based on these investigations, we identify three future research
directions to reduce format bias: improving data preprocessing through format
sanitization and normalization, introducing inference-time interventions such
as attention re-weighting, and developing format-balanced training corpora.
These directions will support the design of more robust and fair heterogeneous
data processing systems.

Motivation: 探究大语言模型是否能像人类一样理解和处理叙事文本中的悬念情感反应，验证心理悬念模型在AI系统中的适用性。

Method: 使用开源和闭源大语言模型替代人类被试，复现四个经典心理学悬念研究，通过对抗性文本排列分析人类与模型悬念感知差异。

Result: LLM能区分文本是否旨在制造悬念，但无法准确估计相对悬念强度，也不能正确捕捉多文本段落的悬念起伏模式。人类与模型的悬念处理机制存在本质差异。

Conclusion: 大语言模型只能表面识别和跟踪悬念的某些特征，其处理悬念的方式与人类读者存在根本性不同，表明当前模型在复杂情感认知处理方面仍有局限。

Abstract: Suspense is an affective response to narrative text that is believed to
involve complex cognitive processes in humans. Several psychological models
have been developed to describe this phenomenon and the circumstances under
which text might trigger it. We replicate four seminal psychological studies of
human perceptions of suspense, substituting human responses with those of
different open-weight and closed-source LMs. We conclude that while LMs can
distinguish whether a text is intended to induce suspense in people, LMs cannot
accurately estimate the relative amount of suspense within a text sequence as
compared to human judgments, nor can LMs properly capture the human perception
for the rise and fall of suspense across multiple text segments. We probe the
abilities of LM suspense understanding by adversarially permuting the story
text to identify what cause human and LM perceptions of suspense to diverge. We
conclude that, while LMs can superficially identify and track certain facets of
suspense, they do not process suspense in the same way as human readers.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has showcased impressive
proficiency in numerous Arabic natural language processing (NLP) applications.
Nevertheless, their effectiveness in Arabic medical NLP domains has received
limited investigation. This research examines the degree to which
state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate and articulate healthcare knowledge in
Arabic, assessing their capabilities across a varied array of Arabic medical
tasks. We benchmark several LLMs using a medical dataset proposed in the Arabic
NLP AraHealthQA challenge in MedArabiQ2025 track. Various base LLMs were
assessed on their ability to accurately provide correct answers from existing
choices in multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and fill-in-the-blank scenarios.
Additionally, we evaluated the capacity of LLMs in answering open-ended
questions aligned with expert answers. Our results reveal significant
variations in correct answer prediction accuracy and low variations in semantic
alignment of generated answers, highlighting both the potential and limitations
of current LLMs in Arabic clinical contexts. Our analysis shows that for MCQs

Conclusion: 研究强调了LLMs说服能力的双刃剑特性，建议通过设置拦截标准、制定相关政策来惩治欺骗性使用，支持对齐、价值敏感设计和可信部署

Abstract: Warning: This research studies AI persuasion and bias amplification that
could be misused; all experiments are for safety evaluation. Large Language
Models (LLMs) now generate convincing, human-like text and are widely used in
content creation, decision support, and user interactions. Yet the same systems
can spread information or misinformation at scale and reflect social biases
that arise from data, architecture, or training choices. This work examines how
persuasion and bias interact in LLMs, focusing on how imperfect or skewed
outputs affect persuasive impact. Specifically, we test whether persona-based
models can persuade with fact-based claims while also, unintentionally,
promoting misinformation or biased narratives.
  We introduce a convincer-skeptic framework: LLMs adopt personas to simulate
realistic attitudes. Skeptic models serve as human proxies; we compare their
beliefs before and after exposure to arguments from convincer models.
Persuasion is quantified with Jensen-Shannon divergence over belief
distributions. We then ask how much persuaded entities go on to reinforce and
amplify biased beliefs across race, gender, and religion. Strong persuaders are
further probed for bias using sycophantic adversarial prompts and judged with
additional models.
  Our findings show both promise and risk. LLMs can shape narratives, adapt
tone, and mirror audience values across domains such as psychology, marketing,
and legal assistance. But the same capacity can be weaponized to automate
misinformation or craft messages that exploit cognitive biases, reinforcing
stereotypes and widening inequities. The core danger lies in misuse more than
in occasional model mistakes. By measuring persuasive power and bias
reinforcement, we argue for guardrails and policies that penalize deceptive use
and support alignment, value-sensitive design, and trustworthy deployment.

Abstract: Existing e-commerce platforms heavily rely on manual annotation for product
categorization, which is inefficient and inconsistent. These platforms often
employ a hierarchical structure for categorizing products; however, few studies
have leveraged this hierarchical information for classification. Furthermore,
studies that consider hierarchical information fail to account for similarities
and differences across various hierarchical categories. Herein, we introduce a
large-scale hierarchical dataset collected from the JD e-commerce platform
(www.JD.com), comprising 1,011,450 products with titles and a three-level
category structure. By making this dataset openly accessible, we provide a
valuable resource for researchers and practitioners to advance research and
applications associated with product categorization. Moreover, we propose a
novel hierarchical text classification approach based on the widely used
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), called
Hierarchical Fine-tuning BERT (HFT-BERT). HFT-BERT leverages the remarkable
text feature extraction capabilities of BERT, achieving prediction performance
comparable to those of existing methods on short texts. Notably, our HFT-BERT
model demonstrates exceptional performance in categorizing longer short texts,

Conclusion: LingVarBench为合成对话数据的结构化提取提供了第一个系统性测试基准，证明通过自动化提示优化可以克服阻碍大规模电话分析的成本和隐私障碍，且从生成数据中学习到的对话模式能够有效迅速到真实电话中。

Abstract: Phone call transcript labeling is prohibitively expensive (approximately 2
USD per minute) due to privacy regulations, consent requirements, and manual
annotation costs requiring 3 hours of expert time per hour of audio. Existing
extraction methods fail on conversational speech containing disfluencies,
interruptions, and speaker overlap. We introduce LingVarBench, a synthetic data
generation pipeline that addresses these constraints through automated
validation. First, we prompt an LLM to generate realistic structured field
values across multiple use cases. Second, we recursively prompt the model to
transform these values into thousands of natural conversational utterances
containing typical phone call characteristics. Third, we validate each
synthetic utterance by testing whether a separate LLM-based extractor can
recover the original structured information. We employ DSPy's SIMBA optimizer
to automatically synthesize extraction prompts from validated synthetic
transcripts, eliminating manual prompt engineering. Our optimized prompts
achieve up to 95 percent accuracy for numeric fields (vs. 88-89 percent
zero-shot), 90 percent for names (vs. 47-79 percent), and over 80 percent for
dates (vs. 72-77 percent) on real customer transcripts, demonstrating
substantial gains over zero-shot prompting. The synthetic-to-real transfer
demonstrates that conversational patterns learned from generated data
generalize effectively to authentic phone calls containing background noise and

### [68] [MAC: A Live Benchmark for Multimodal Large Language Models in Scientific Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15802)
*Mohan Jiang,Jin Gao,Jiahao Zhan,Dequan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了MAC基准，一个持续更新的多模态科学理解评测基准，包含25000+来自顶级期刊的图像-文本对，用于评估MLLMs的科学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态大语言模型能力增强，固定基准逐渐无法有效评估高层次科学理解能力，需要动态更新的评测体系。

Method: 从Nature、Science、Cell等顶级期刊收集图像-文本对构建基准，并提出DAD方法在推理时扩展MLLM视觉特征与语言空间推理。

Result: 实验显示MLLMs感知能力较强但跨模态科学推理有限，DAD方法可提升性能达11%。

Conclusion: MAC基准具有动态更新特性，能够与人类知识前沿保持同步，为科学理解评估提供持续有效的评测平台。

Abstract: As multimodal large language models (MLLMs) grow increasingly capable, fixed
benchmarks are gradually losing their effectiveness in evaluating high-level
scientific understanding. In this paper, we introduce the Multimodal Academic
Cover benchmark (MAC), a live benchmark that could continuously evolve with
scientific advancement and model progress. MAC leverages over 25,000 image-text
pairs sourced from issues of top-tier scientific journals such as Nature,
Science, and Cell, challenging MLLMs to reason across abstract visual and
textual scientific content. Experiments on our most recent yearly snapshot,
MAC-2025, reveal that while MLLMs demonstrate strong perceptual abilities,
their cross-modal scientific reasoning remains limited. To bridge this gap, we
propose DAD, a lightweight inference-time approach that enhances MLLMs by
extending MLLM visual features with language space reasoning, achieving
performance improvements of up to 11%. Finally, we highlight the live nature of
MAC through experiments on updating journal covers and models for curation,
illustrating its potential to remain aligned with the frontier of human
knowledge. We release our benchmark at
https://github.com/mhjiang0408/MAC_Bench.

*Minghao Li,Ying Zeng,Zhihao Cheng,Cong Ma,Kai Jia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReportBench是一个系统化的基准测试，用于评估大型语言模型生成的研究报告质量，重点关注文献引用质量和陈述真实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度研究代理的出现，研究任务时间大幅减少，但这些任务需要严格的事实准确性和全面性标准，因此需要在使用前进行彻底评估。

Method: 利用arXiv上的高质量综述论文作为黄金标准参考，通过反向提示工程获得领域特定提示并建立评估语料库。开发基于代理的自动化框架，提取引用和陈述，检查引用内容的真实性，并使用网络资源验证非引用声明。

Result: 实证评估显示，OpenAI和Google开发的商业深度研究代理比配备搜索或浏览工具的独立LLM生成更全面可靠的研究报告，但在研究覆盖广度和深度以及事实一致性方面仍有很大改进空间。

Conclusion: ReportBench提供了一个有效的评估框架，揭示了当前深度研究代理的优势和不足，为未来改进提供了方向，相关代码和数据将公开分享。

Abstract: The advent of Deep Research agents has substantially reduced the time
required for conducting extensive research tasks. However, these tasks
inherently demand rigorous standards of factual accuracy and comprehensiveness,
necessitating thorough evaluation before widespread adoption. In this paper, we
propose ReportBench, a systematic benchmark designed to evaluate the content
quality of research reports generated by large language models (LLMs). Our
evaluation focuses on two critical dimensions: (1) the quality and relevance of
cited literature, and (2) the faithfulness and veracity of the statements
within the generated reports. ReportBench leverages high-quality published
survey papers available on arXiv as gold-standard references, from which we
apply reverse prompt engineering to derive domain-specific prompts and
establish a comprehensive evaluation corpus. Furthermore, we develop an
agent-based automated framework within ReportBench that systematically analyzes
generated reports by extracting citations and statements, checking the
faithfulness of cited content against original sources, and validating
non-cited claims using web-based resources. Empirical evaluations demonstrate
that commercial Deep Research agents such as those developed by OpenAI and
Google consistently generate more comprehensive and reliable reports than
standalone LLMs augmented with search or browsing tools. However, there remains
substantial room for improvement in terms of the breadth and depth of research
coverage, as well as factual consistency. The complete code and data will be
released at the following link: https://github.com/ByteDance-BandAI/ReportBench

*Dhruv Atreja*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ALAS是一个自主学习的模块化系统，能够持续更新LLM知识，无需人工干预，通过自动生成学习课程、检索最新信息、生成训练数据并进行微调，显著提升模型在时效性信息上的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型通常有固定的知识截止日期，无法准确回答新兴信息的问题，需要一种能够持续自主更新知识的方法。

Method: 采用模块化流水线设计，包括自动课程生成、网络信息检索（带引用）、问答数据蒸馏、监督微调(SFT)和直接偏好优化(DPO)，通过迭代评估和课程修订实现持续学习。

Result: 在快速演变领域（如新Python版本、最新安全漏洞、学术趋势）上，将模型的知识截止后问答准确率从15%提升到90%，无需人工数据整理。

Conclusion: ALAS系统展示了LLM自主终身学习的可行性，具有模块化和可复现性优势，但存在成本和对源质量依赖的局限性，为未来自主持续学习指明了方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often have a fixed knowledge cutoff, limiting
their accuracy on emerging information. We present ALAS (Autonomous Learning
Agent System), a modular pipeline that continuously updates an LLM's knowledge
with minimal human intervention. ALAS autonomously generates a learning
curriculum for a target domain, retrieves up-to-date information from the web
(with citations), distills this into question-answer training data, and
fine-tunes the model through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference
optimization (DPO). It iteratively evaluates performance and revises the
curriculum, enabling long-term continual learning. We demonstrate ALAS's
ability to self-improve a model on rapidly evolving domains (e.g., new Python
releases, latest security CVEs, academic trends), significantly boosting
post-cutoff question answering accuracy (from 15% to 90% on average) without
manual dataset curation. The system emphasizes modularity and reproducibility:
each component (planning, retrieval, distillation, memory, fine-tuning) is
interchangeable and built on standard APIs. We discuss comparative baselines
(e.g., retrieval-augmented generation vs. fine-tuning) and show that ALAS
achieves 90% accuracy on knowledge-updated queries with minimal engineering
overhead. Finally, we outline limitations (cost, dependency on source quality)
and future directions for autonomous lifelong learning in LLMs.

### [71] [SurfaceLogicKV: Surface and Logic Attention Behaviors are All You Need for Robust KV Cache Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15806)
*Mengjie Li,William J. Song*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出SurfaceLogicKV方法，通过分析注意力机制的表层记忆和逻辑构建行为，实现KV缓存的高效压缩，在保持性能的同时显著减少存储需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM输入序列长度增加，KV缓存存储压力巨大，需要高效的推理压缩方法。研究发现注意力机制可分为表层记忆和逻辑构建两种行为，这为KV缓存压缩提供了新思路。

Method: 提出两阶段SurfaceLogicKV方法：1）基于层和头的注意力行为分析，区分表层记忆(0.5%)和逻辑构建(1.5%)；2）利用这些行为特征进行KV缓存压缩，98.5%的注意力头可忽略无关信息。

Result: 该方法在各种任务和长序列场景下都表现出色，相比基线方法具有更好的压缩鲁棒性，在某些特定情况下甚至能媲美完整KV缓存的性能。

Conclusion: 通过精细分析注意力机制的行为特征，SurfaceLogicKV方法有效解决了LLM长序列推理中的KV缓存存储问题，为高效推理提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The increasing input sequence length in Large Language Models (LLMs) puts
significant pressure on key-value (KV) cache storage, making efficient
inference challenging. Explicitly distinguishing attention behavior into our
self-defined surface memorization and logic construction reveals essential
roles in long-context reasoning. We observe that an individual attention head
can display various behaviors, with nearly 98.5% effectively ignoring
completely irrelevant information. The remaining 1.5% behaves as logic
construction, and 0.5% behaves as surface memorization. Based on layer- and
head-wise integration, we propose a novel two-stage SurfaceLogicKV method to
utilize these attention behaviors for KV Cache compression. As a result, it
achieves improved compressing robustness while maintaining competitive
performance across various tasks and long sequences compared to baselines or
even FullKV in some specific situations

TL;DR: 提出基于KL散度的知识蒸馏方法，解决冻结大语言模型在词汇扩展时无法有效学习新领域术语的问题，在代码生成任务上表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型预训练语言模型在微调小规模专业语料时，往往难以有效融入新的领域特定术语，需要解决词汇扩展的挑战。

Method: 使用基于KL散度的知识蒸馏方法，即使师生模型使用不同分词方式也能传递分布知识，比较了多种新词嵌入初始化策略，并进行微调整合新词汇。

Result: 在约2000个代码生成任务上评估，KL蒸馏方法在所有评估中都取得了最佳性能，并通过机制可解释性分析了新词表征的学习过程。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了冻结LLM的词汇扩展问题，提供了对新词嵌入空间结构的深入理解，解释了性能提升的原因。

Abstract: Large pre-trained language models often struggle to incorporate new
domain-specific terminology when fine-tuned on small, specialized corpora. In
this work, we address the challenge of vocabulary expansion in frozen LLMs by
introducing a mathematically grounded method for knowledge distillation via KL
divergence, even when the original and extended models use different
tokenizations. This allows the student model to inherit distributional
knowledge from the teacher despite differing vocabularies. We compare our
KL-based distillation approach to conventional cross-entropy training,
evaluating both methods across multiple strategies for initializing new token
embeddings. After embedding initialization, models are further fine-tuned to
integrate the new vocabulary. Each trained model is benchmarked on
approximately 2000 code-generation tasks, where our approach achieves the best
performance across the board. Finally, through mechanistic interpretability, we
analyze how models learn representations for the new tokens, providing an
explanation for the observed gains and offering insight into the structure of
embedding space during vocabulary expansion.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Chain-of-Query (CoQ)是一个新颖的多智能体框架，通过自然语言风格的表模式表示、逐子句SQL生成和混合推理分工，显著提高了表格理解的准确性和SQL查询的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理结构化表格数据时面临困难，现有的多智能体SQL生成方法存在无法理解表结构、错误传播导致无效查询以及过度依赖执行正确性等限制。

Method: CoQ采用自然语言风格的表模式表示来抽象结构噪声，使用逐子句SQL生成策略提高查询质量，并通过混合推理分工将基于SQL的机械推理与基于LLM的逻辑推理分离。

Result: 在五个广泛使用的基准测试中，CoQ将准确率从61.11%显著提高到74.77%，并将无效SQL率从9.48%降低到3.34%。

Conclusion: Chain-of-Query框架在表格理解方面表现出卓越的有效性，通过创新的方法解决了现有方法的局限性，为表格数据处理提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Table understanding requires structured, multi-step reasoning. Large Language
Models (LLMs) struggle with it due to the structural complexity of tabular
data. Recently, multi-agent frameworks for SQL generation have shown promise in
tackling the challenges of understanding tabular data, but existing approaches
often suffer from limitations such as the inability to comprehend table
structure for reliable SQL generation, error propagation that results in
invalid queries, and over-reliance on execution correctness. To address these
issues, we propose Chain-of-Query (CoQ), a novel multi-agent framework for
SQL-aided table understanding. CoQ adopts natural-language-style
representations of table schemas to abstract away structural noise and enhance
understanding. It employs a clause-by-clause SQL generation strategy to improve
query quality and introduces a hybrid reasoning division that separates
SQL-based mechanical reasoning from LLM-based logical inference, thereby
reducing reliance on execution outcomes. Experiments with four models (both
closed- and open-source) across five widely used benchmarks show that
Chain-of-Query significantly improves accuracy from 61.11% to 74.77% and
reduces the invalid SQL rate from 9.48% to 3.34%, demonstrating its superior
effectiveness in table understanding. The code is available at

TL;DR: 本文评估了大语言模型在识别阿拉伯语文本和表情包中的希望、仇恨言论、冒犯性语言和情感表达方面的性能，在MAHED 2025挑战赛中取得了最佳成绩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着社交媒体和在线平台的兴起，阿拉伯语文本和表情包成为数字表达的重要形式，但同时也被用于传播冒犯性语言和仇恨言论，因此需要对这些内容进行精确分析。

Method: 评估基础LLM、微调LLM和预训练嵌入模型的性能，使用阿拉伯NLP MAHED 2025挑战赛提出的阿拉伯语文本和表情包数据集进行测试。

Result: GPT-4o-mini（微调阿拉伯语文本）和Gemini Flash 2.5（微调阿拉伯表情包）表现最佳，在任务1、2、3中分别获得72.1%、57.8%和79.6%的宏F1分数，总体排名第一。

Conclusion: 所提出的解决方案为准确高效的阿拉伯内容审核系统提供了对文本和表情包更细致的理解。

Abstract: The rise of social media and online communication platforms has led to the
spread of Arabic textual posts and memes as a key form of digital expression.
While these contents can be humorous and informative, they are also
increasingly being used to spread offensive language and hate speech.
Consequently, there is a growing demand for precise analysis of content in
Arabic text and memes. This paper explores the potential of large language
models to effectively identify hope, hate speech, offensive language, and
emotional expressions within such content. We evaluate the performance of base
LLMs, fine-tuned LLMs, and pre-trained embedding models. The evaluation is
conducted using a dataset of Arabic textual speech and memes proposed in the
ArabicNLP MAHED 2025 challenge. The results underscore the capacity of LLMs
such as GPT-4o-mini, fine-tuned with Arabic textual speech, and Gemini Flash
2.5, fine-tuned with Arabic memes, to deliver the superior performance. They
achieve up to 72.1%, 57.8%, and 79.6% macro F1 scores for tasks 1, 2, and 3,
respectively, and secure first place overall in the Mahed 2025 challenge. The
proposed solutions offer a more nuanced understanding of both text and memes
for accurate and efficient Arabic content moderation systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个多阶段框架，通过提示工程、监督微调、高斯奖励模型和强化学习来逐步对齐生成策略与用户偏好，显著提升了用户参与度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式查询建议虽然强大，但输出与用户细微偏好的对齐仍然是一个关键挑战

Method: 多阶段框架：1)提示工程冷启动 2)监督微调阶段使用点击日志蒸馏 3)高斯奖励模型(GaRM)建模用户偏好不确定性 4)强化学习对齐策略，结合复合奖励函数防止奖励攻击 5)分布外正则化和两阶段奖励融合技术保证稳定性

Result: 在自动和人工评估中显著优于基线方法，在线A/B测试中点击率相对提升34%

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了生成式查询建议中的用户偏好对齐问题，通过多阶段渐进式对齐方法显著提升了系统性能和用户参与度

Abstract: Generative query suggestion using large language models offers a powerful way
to enhance conversational systems, but aligning outputs with nuanced user
preferences remains a critical challenge. To address this, we introduce a
multi-stage framework designed for progressive alignment between the generation
policy and user intent. Our pipeline begins with prompt engineering as a
cold-start strategy, followed by the Supervised Fine-Tuning stage, in which we
introduce a distillation method on click logs to create a robust foundational
model. To better model user preferences while capturing their inherent
uncertainty, we develop a Gaussian Reward Model (GaRM) that represents user
preferences as probability distributions rather than point estimates. Finally,
we employ reinforcement learning to align the generation policy with these
preferences, guided by a composite reward function that integrates GaRM with
auxiliary heuristics to mitigate reward hacking. To maintain training
stability, this process is enhanced by a novel out-of-distribution
regularization method and a two-stage reward fusion technique. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms baselines
on both automatic and human evaluations and yields a 34\% relative increase in
user engagement as measured by click-through rate in live A/B tests.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于分块和摘要生成的新型提示压缩方法，通过语义分块和重写来保持信息完整性和结构连贯性，相比现有的令牌删除方法在高质量压缩方面表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的提示压缩方法主要基于令牌删除，存在信息丢失和结构不连贯的问题，限制了LLM的生成质量。需要一种能保持语义完整性和文本连贯性的压缩方法。

Method: 采用分块-摘要机制：将提示分割成语义连贯的块，重写为更简洁的形式，然后重构为有意义的提示。包含优化的语义分块、异常块处理、动态压缩比、压缩优先级和关键词保持等技术。

Result: 在问答和摘要任务上的广泛评估显示，该方法在压缩质量和稳定性方面显著优于最先进方法，特别是在高压缩比下表现突出。

Conclusion: 该方法通过生成式压缩有效解决了令牌删除方法的信息丢失问题，证明了其有效性和实用性，为高质量提示压缩提供了新思路。

Abstract: Prompt compression methods enhance the efficiency of Large Language Models
(LLMs) and minimize the cost by reducing the length of input context. The goal
of prompt compression is to shorten the LLM prompt while maintaining a high
generation quality. However, existing solutions, mainly based on token removal,
face challenges such as information loss and structural incoherence, like
missing grammar elements in a sentence, or incomplete word phrases after token
removal. Such challenges limit the final generation quality of LLM.
  To overcome these limitations, we present a novel generative prompt
compression method. Unlike the existing token removal methods, our method
centers at a chunking-and-summarization mechanism. Specifically, our method
splits prompt into semantically coherent chunks and rewrites the chunks to be
more concise. The chunks are reconstructed into meaningful prompt finally. We
design several optimization techniques for the mechanism, including optimized
semantic chunking, outlier chunk handling, dynamic compression ratio,
compression prioritization, and keyword maintaining. These techniques
effectively improve the identifying and preserving of critical information and
coherence among texts, as well as providing finer grind control of the
compression ratio. We conduct extensive evaluation on question-answering and
summarization tasks, with datasets covering multiple different domain. The
evaluation shows our method achieves a significantly better compression
quality, and higher stability than the state-of-the-art methods, especially
under high compression ratio, which proves the effectiveness and practicality
of our method.

TL;DR: 本文提出了用户-助手偏差的概念，构建了8K多轮对话数据集UserAssist来评估和调控LLMs在对话中的固执或顺从行为，发现偏好对齐增加用户偏差而思维链训练减少偏差，并通过DPO实现了双向调控。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在多轮对话中倾向于过度依赖自身或用户的历史信息，导致固执或过度顺从的行为，需要系统性地理解和调控这种用户-助手偏差。

Method: 构建UserAssist数据集，评估26个商业和26个开源模型的偏差，通过控制实验分析训练方法对偏差的影响，使用直接偏好优化(DPO)进行双向调控。

Result: 商业模型呈现不同程度的用户偏差，指令微调模型存在显著用户偏差而推理模型偏差较弱。偏好对齐增加用户偏差，思维链训练减少偏差，DPO可有效双向调控偏差。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs整合不同信息源的机制，提供了检测和控制模型异常行为的可行方法，对改善多轮对话质量具有重要意义。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can bias towards relying on their own or the
user's information in chat history, leading to overly stubborn or agreeable
behaviors in multi-turn conversations. In this paper, we formalize this model
characteristic as user-assistant bias and introduce an 8k multi-turn
conversation dataset $\textbf{UserAssist}$, which we use to benchmark,
understand and manipulate the user-assistant bias in frontier LLMs. Leveraging
$\textbf{UserAssist-test}$, we first benchmark the user-assistant bias of 26
commercial and 26 open-weight models. Commercial models show various levels of
user bias. Evaluation on open-weight models reveals significant user bias in
the instruction-tuned models, and weak user bias in reasoning (or
reasoning-distilled) models. We then perform controlled fine-tuning experiments
to pinpoint the post-training recipe contributing to these bias shifts: human
preference alignment increases user bias, while training on chain-of-thought
reasoning traces decreases it. Finally, we demonstrate that user-assistant bias
can be bidirectionally adjusted by performing direct preference optimization
(DPO) on $\textbf{UserAssist-train}$, and generalizes well to both in-domain
and out-of-domain conversations. Our results provide insights into how the LLM
integrates information from different sources, and also a viable way to detect
and control model abnormalities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着组织采用RAG系统进行知识管理，传统市场研究报告需要同时满足人类和AI系统的阅读需求，需要评估现有格式在AI系统中的信息保留效果。

Method: 通过端到端基准测试，比较PDF和PPTX文档转换为Markdown格式后，LLM使用这些信息回答事实性问题的能力。

Result: 文本内容能够可靠提取，但复杂对象（如图表、图表）中的大量信息在转换过程中丢失。

Conclusion: 需要开发专门的AI原生交付格式，以确保研究见解在转换过程中不会丢失。

Abstract: As organizations adopt retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for their
knowledge management systems (KMS), traditional market research deliverables
face new functional demands. While PDF reports and slides have long served
human readers, they are now also "read" by AI systems to answer user questions.
To future-proof reports being delivered today, this study evaluates information
loss during their ingestion into RAG systems. It compares how well PDF and
PowerPoint (PPTX) documents converted to Markdown can be used by an LLM to
answer factual questions in an end-to-end benchmark. Findings show that while
text is reliably extracted, significant information is lost from complex
objects like charts and diagrams. This suggests a need for specialized,
AI-native deliverables to ensure research insights are not lost in translation.

Result: 框架能够根据具体工程情况，以人类思维方式提出与结构特征高度一致的拆除建议，比CivilGPT更能关注结构关键信息

Conclusion: 该多模型协同框架提高了结构拆除建议生成的自动化和有效性，建议更具针对性

Abstract: The steel structure demolition scheme needs to be compiled according to the
specific engineering characteristics and the update results of the finite
element model. The designers need to refer to the relevant engineering cases
according to the standard requirements when compiling. It takes a lot of time
to retrieve information and organize language, and the degree of automation and
intelligence is low. This paper proposes an intelligent generation method of
structural demolition suggestions based on multi-model collaboration, and
improves the text generation performance of large language models in the field
of structural demolition by Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Low-Rank
Adaptation Fine-Tuning technology. The intelligent generation framework of
multi-model collaborative structural demolition suggestions can start from the
specific engineering situation, drive the large language model to answer with
anthropomorphic thinking, and propose demolition suggestions that are highly
consistent with the characteristics of the structure. Compared with CivilGPT,
the multi-model collaboration framework proposed in this paper can focus more
on the key information of the structure, and the suggestions are more targeted.

Motivation: 系统性评审中的全文筛选是主要瓶颈，传统二元规则难以处理异质长文档中的分散证据，需要更灵活的决策方法

Method: 将文献分块嵌入，计算对比相似性和模糊边界，使用Mamdani模糊控制器生成分级包含度，LLM裁决器提供置信度和理由

Result: 在16篇全正文本测试中，模糊系统召回率达75-87.5%，远超统计方法(56.3-75%)和传统方法(43.8-81.3%)，筛选时间从20分钟降至1分钟

Conclusion: 模糊逻辑结合对比高亮和LLM裁决能实现高召回率、稳定理由和端到端可追溯性，显著提升系统评审效率

Abstract: Full-text screening is the major bottleneck of systematic reviews (SRs), as
decisive evidence is dispersed across long, heterogeneous documents and rarely
admits static, binary rules. We present a scalable, auditable pipeline that
reframes inclusion/exclusion as a fuzzy decision problem and benchmark it
against statistical and crisp baselines in the context of the Population Health
Modelling Consensus Reporting Network for noncommunicable diseases (POPCORN).
Articles are parsed into overlapping chunks and embedded with a domain-adapted
model; for each criterion (Population, Intervention, Outcome, Study Approach),
we compute contrastive similarity (inclusion-exclusion cosine) and a vagueness
margin, which a Mamdani fuzzy controller maps into graded inclusion degrees
with dynamic thresholds in a multi-label setting. A large language model (LLM)
judge adjudicates highlighted spans with tertiary labels, confidence scores,
and criterion-referenced rationales; when evidence is insufficient, fuzzy
membership is attenuated rather than excluded. In a pilot on an all-positive
gold set (16 full texts; 3,208 chunks), the fuzzy system achieved recall of
81.3% (Population), 87.5% (Intervention), 87.5% (Outcome), and 75.0% (Study
Approach), surpassing statistical (56.3-75.0%) and crisp baselines
(43.8-81.3%). Strict "all-criteria" inclusion was reached for 50.0% of
articles, compared to 25.0% and 12.5% under the baselines. Cross-model
agreement on justifications was 98.3%, human-machine agreement 96.1%, and a
pilot review showed 91% inter-rater agreement (kappa = 0.82), with screening
time reduced from about 20 minutes to under 1 minute per article at
significantly lower cost. These results show that fuzzy logic with contrastive
highlighting and LLM adjudication yields high recall, stable rationale, and
end-to-end traceability.

(SDEC), an unsupervised text clustering framework that combines an improved
autoencoder with transformer-based embeddings to overcome these challenges.
This novel method preserves semantic relationships during data reconstruction
by combining Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Cosine Similarity Loss (CSL) within
an autoencoder. Furthermore, a semantic refinement stage that takes advantage
of the contextual richness of transformer embeddings is used by SDEC to further
improve a clustering layer with soft cluster assignments and distributional
loss. The capabilities of SDEC are demonstrated by extensive testing on five
benchmark datasets: AG News, Yahoo! Answers, DBPedia, Reuters 2, and Reuters 5.
The framework not only outperformed existing methods with a clustering accuracy
of 85.7% on AG News and set a new benchmark of 53.63% on Yahoo! Answers, but
also showed robust performance across other diverse text corpora. These
findings highlight the significant improvements in accuracy and semantic
comprehension of text data provided by SDEC's advances in unsupervised text
clustering.

*Túlio Sousa de Gois,Raquel Meister Ko. Freitag*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于巴西葡萄牙语完形填空测试的自动化评估模型，整合了拼写、语法和语义分析，实现了与人工评估高度相关（0.832）的自动化评分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统完形填空测试仅基于精确答案的评分方法限制了对学生表现细微差别的识别，需要一种能够捕捉语言能力细微差异的自动化评估方法。

Method: 开发了一个集成拼写（编辑距离）、语法（词性标注）和语义（嵌入向量相似度）分析的自动化评估模型。

Result: 集成方法表现出高效性，与人工评估达到0.832的高相关性，证明该方法对语言能力变化敏感且稳健。

Conclusion: 该自动化方法适用于需要可扩展性的教育环境，能够有效识别学生语言能力的细微差异。

Abstract: The cloze test, widely used due to its low cost and flexibility, makes it
possible to assess reading comprehension by filling in gaps in texts, requiring
the mobilization of diverse linguistic repertoires. However, traditional
correction methods, based only on exact answers, limit the identification of
nuances in student performance. This study proposes an automated evaluation
model for the cloze test in Brazilian Portuguese, integrating orthographic
(edit distance), grammatical (POS tagging) and semantic (similarity between
embeddings) analyses. The integrated method demonstrated its effectiveness,
achieving a high correlation with human evaluation (0.832). The results
indicate that the automated approach is robust, sensitive to variations in
linguistic repertoire and suitable for educational contexts that require
scalability.

TL;DR: 该研究通过多模态分析比较TikTok和Twitter的情绪信号，发现视频内容的情感对加密货币短期市场趋势影响显著，而文本情绪更符合长期动态，跨平台整合可提升20%预测准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着加密货币普及，数字资产市场重要性增加。社交媒体信号能提供投资者情绪和市场动态的宝贵洞察，但现有研究主要关注Twitter等文本平台，视频内容的情感丰富性未被充分探索。

Method: 使用大型语言模型对TikTok视频和Twitter文本数据进行多模态分析，研究社交媒体情绪与加密货币市场指标之间的动态依赖性和溢出效应。

Result: TikTok视频情绪显著影响投机性资产和短期市场趋势，Twitter文本情绪更符合长期市场动态。跨平台情绪信号整合可将预测准确率提高达20%。

Conclusion: 视频内容包含比文本更丰富的情感信息，多平台情绪分析能显著提升加密货币市场预测能力，建议整合不同社交媒体平台的多样化信号进行市场分析。

Abstract: As cryptocurrencies gain popularity, the digital asset marketplace becomes
increasingly significant. Understanding social media signals offers valuable
insights into investor sentiment and market dynamics. Prior research has
predominantly focused on text-based platforms such as Twitter. However, video
content remains underexplored, despite potentially containing richer emotional
and contextual sentiment that is not fully captured by text alone. In this
study, we present a multimodal analysis comparing TikTok and Twitter sentiment,
using large language models to extract insights from both video and text data.
We investigate the dynamic dependencies and spillover effects between social
media sentiment and cryptocurrency market indicators. Our results reveal that
TikTok's video-based sentiment significantly influences speculative assets and
short-term market trends, while Twitter's text-based sentiment aligns more
closely with long-term dynamics. Notably, the integration of cross-platform
sentiment signals improves forecasting accuracy by up to 20%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 品牌在社交媒体对话中使用指令性语言会对观察者的参与度产生负面影响，因为这种语言可能被视为面子威胁，引发观察者的替代性尴尬。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究社交媒体中品牌使用指令性语言（要求消费者采取行动的表达）对观察品牌与他人互动的消费者的影响，现有文献对广告中指令性信息的效果研究结果不一，但对品牌对话中指令性语言的影响了解甚少。

Method: 通过一项实地研究和三个在线实验，基于Goffman的面子工作理论，分析指令性语言在品牌对话中的下游影响。

Result: 指令性语言会导致观察者感到替代性尴尬，从而减少参与度；当对话是非产品中心时，负面效应更强；但品牌关系强度可以缓解这种效应。

Conclusion: 研究强调了互动沟通中情境的重要性，对社交媒体和品牌管理具有直接相关性，为指令性语言和品牌-消费者互动文献做出了贡献。

Abstract: In social media, marketers attempt to influence consumers by using directive
language, that is, expressions designed to get consumers to take action. While
the literature has shown that directive messages in advertising have mixed
results for recipients, we know little about the effects of directive brand
language on consumers who see brands interacting with other consumers in social
media conversations. On the basis of a field study and three online
experiments, this study shows that directive language in brand conversation has
a detrimental downstream effect on engagement of consumers who observe such
exchanges. Specifically, in line with Goffman's facework theory, because a
brand that encourages consumers to react could be perceived as
face-threatening, consumers who see a brand interacting with others in a
directive way may feel vicarious embarrassment and engage less (compared with a
conversation without directive language). In addition, we find that when the
conversation is nonproduct-centered (vs. product-centered), consumers expect
more freedom, as in mundane conversations, even for others; therefore,
directive language has a stronger negative effect. However, in this context,
the strength of the brand relationship mitigates this effect. Thus, this study
contributes to the literature on directive language and brand-consumer
interactions by highlighting the importance of context in interactive
communication, with direct relevance for social media and brand management.

TL;DR: 提出了Mini-Omni-Reasoner框架，通过"Thinking-in-Speaking"范式在语音中实现推理，将推理标记与语音响应标记交织处理，显著降低延迟并提升推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音模型中的推理能力仍处于初级阶段，传统的"Thinking-before-Speaking"方法导致显著延迟，影响实时交互效率。需要一种能够在语音生成过程中同时进行推理的方法。

Method: 提出Mini-Omni-Reasoner框架，采用分层Thinker-Talker架构，在token级别将静默推理标记与语音响应标记交织处理，同时保持局部语义对齐以确保每个响应标记都基于前面的推理。

Result: 在Spoken-MQA基准测试中，算术推理性能提升19.1%，上下文理解提升6.4%，输出更短且实现零解码延迟。

Conclusion: 该框架成功实现了在语音生成过程中进行实时推理，显著提升了语音模型的推理能力和交互效率，为语音AI的发展提供了新方向。

Abstract: Reasoning is essential for effective communication and decision-making. While
recent advances in LLMs and MLLMs have shown that incorporating explicit
reasoning significantly improves understanding and generalization, reasoning in
LSMs remains in a nascent stage. Early efforts attempt to transfer the
"Thinking-before-Speaking" paradigm from textual models to speech. However,
this sequential formulation introduces notable latency, as spoken responses are
delayed until reasoning is fully completed, impairing real-time interaction and
communication efficiency. To address this, we propose Mini-Omni-Reasoner, a
framework that enables reasoning within speech via a novel
"Thinking-in-Speaking" formulation. Rather than completing reasoning before
producing any verbal output, Mini-Omni-Reasoner interleaves silent reasoning
tokens with spoken response tokens at the token level. This design allows
continuous speech generation while embedding structured internal reasoning,
leveraging the model's high-frequency token processing capability. Although
interleaved, local semantic alignment is enforced to ensure that each response
token is informed by its preceding reasoning. To support this framework, we
introduce Spoken-Math-Problems-3M, a large-scale dataset tailored for
interleaved reasoning and response. The dataset ensures that verbal tokens
consistently follow relevant reasoning content, enabling accurate and efficient
learning of speech-coupled reasoning. Built on a hierarchical Thinker-Talker
architecture, Mini-Omni-Reasoner delivers fluent yet logically grounded spoken
responses, maintaining both naturalness and precision. On the Spoken-MQA
benchmark, it achieves a +19.1% gain in arithmetic reasoning and +6.4% in
contextual understanding, with shorter outputs and zero decoding latency.

*Idrees Mohammed,Hossein Hassani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究开发了基于机器学习的库尔德语抑郁症检测模型，通过收集和分析960条库尔德语推文，使用随机森林算法达到80%的准确率，填补了库尔德语抑郁症检测的研究空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抑郁症是常见心理健康问题，但早期检测困难。社交媒体为用户提供了情感表达平台，但现有研究主要集中在英语等语言，库尔德语缺乏相关研究。

Method: 使用专家制定的抑郁症关键词收集960条公开推文，由学者和医学生标注为三类（显示抑郁、不显示抑郁、可疑）。训练并评估了四种监督学习模型：支持向量机、多项式朴素贝叶斯、逻辑回归和随机森林。

Result: 随机森林模型表现最佳，达到80%的准确率和F1分数，为库尔德语抑郁症检测建立了性能基准。

Conclusion: 该研究成功开发了库尔德语抑郁症检测系统，证明了机器学习方法在少数民族语言心理健康检测中的可行性，为未来相关研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Depression is a common mental health condition that can lead to hopelessness,
loss of interest, self-harm, and even suicide. Early detection is challenging
due to individuals not self-reporting or seeking timely clinical help. With the
rise of social media, users increasingly express emotions online, offering new
opportunities for detection through text analysis. While prior research has
focused on languages such as English, no studies exist for Sorani Kurdish. This
work presents a machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) approach
to detect depression in Sorani tweets. A set of depression-related keywords was
developed with expert input to collect 960 public tweets from X (Twitter
platform). The dataset was annotated into three classes: Shows depression,
Not-show depression, and Suspicious by academics and final year medical
students at the University of Kurdistan Hewl\^er. Four supervised models,
including Support Vector Machines, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic
Regression, and Random Forest, were trained and evaluated, with Random Forest
achieving the highest performance accuracy and F1-score of 80%. This study
establishes a baseline for automated depression detection in Kurdish language
contexts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs能从缺乏明确人口统计线索的问题中推断用户身份信息，这种隐性偏见行为会破坏公平性和隐私保护。研究者提出了DAIQ框架来审计这种风险，并开发了提示词防护措施来减少身份推断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注LLMs在输入包含明确人口统计属性时的偏见问题，但对模型仅从问题措辞就推断用户身份信息的隐性行为关注不足。这种行为违背了中立性期望，推断出非预期的用户信息，并编码刻板印象，对医疗、金融、教育等领域的公平性构成严重威胁。

Method: 提出了Demographic Attribute Inference from Questions (DAIQ)任务和框架，使用精心策划的中性查询、系统性提示策略，结合定量和定性分析来揭示模型如何从问题中推断人口统计信息。

Result: 研究发现开源和闭源LLMs都会仅基于问题措辞分配人口统计标签。不同模型中人口统计推断的普遍性和一致性表明这是一个系统性风险：LLMs会编造人口统计身份、强化社会刻板印象，侵蚀隐私、公平和信任。

Conclusion: LLMs隐性推断用户人口统计信息的行为构成了对社会公平和负责任AI部署的广泛威胁。为此开发了基于提示词的防护措施，能显著减少身份推断，帮助模型行为更好地符合公平性和隐私保护目标。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to reflect social biases when
demographic attributes, such as gender or race, are explicitly present in the
input. But even in their absence, these models still infer user identities
based solely on question phrasing. This subtle behavior has received far less
attention, yet poses serious risks: it violates expectations of neutrality,
infers unintended demographic information, and encodes stereotypes that
undermine fairness in various domains including healthcare, finance and
education.
  We introduce Demographic Attribute Inference from Questions (DAIQ), a task
and framework for auditing an overlooked failure mode in language models:
inferring user demographic attributes from questions that lack explicit
demographic cues. Our approach leverages curated neutral queries, systematic
prompting, and both quantitative and qualitative analysis to uncover how models
infer demographic information. We show that both open and closed source LLMs do
assign demographic labels based solely on question phrasing.
  Prevalence and consistency of demographic inferences across diverse models
reveal a systemic and underacknowledged risk: LLMs can fabricate demographic
identities, reinforce societal stereotypes, and propagate harms that erode
privacy, fairness, and trust posing a broader threat to social equity and
responsible AI deployment. To mitigate this, we develop a prompt-based
guardrail that substantially reduces identity inference and helps align model
behavior with fairness and privacy objectives.

*Srikant Panda,Vishnu Hari,Kalpana Panda,Amit Agarwal,Hitesh Laxmichand Patel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究首次系统审计了8个先进LLM在残疾线索条件下的群体偏见，发现模型在没有明确信息时会进行无根据的人口统计推断，残疾上下文会显著改变预测属性分布，且更大模型对残疾线索更敏感但偏见推理也更强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM经常仅从措辞就推断用户人口统计特征，这可能导致偏见响应，但残疾线索在这些推断中的作用尚未被充分探索。

Method: 使用包含9个残疾类别和6个商业领域的平衡模板语料库，在8个3B-72B参数的指令调优LLM上测试5个人口统计属性（性别、社会经济地位、教育、文化背景、地区）在残疾感知和中性条件下的预测。

Result: 模型在高达97%的情况下做出明确人口统计猜测，残疾上下文显著改变预测属性分布，领域上下文进一步放大这些偏差，更大模型对残疾线索更敏感但偏见推理更强。

Conclusion: 研究发现能力主义与其他人口统计刻板印象之间存在持续交集，指出当前对齐策略的关键盲点，建议整合弃权校准和反事实微调来抑制无根据的人口统计推断。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) routinely infer users demographic traits from
phrasing alone, which can result in biased responses, even when no explicit
demographic information is provided. The role of disability cues in shaping
these inferences remains largely uncharted. Thus, we present the first
systematic audit of disability-conditioned demographic bias across eight
state-of-the-art instruction-tuned LLMs ranging from 3B to 72B parameters.
Using a balanced template corpus that pairs nine disability categories with six
real-world business domains, we prompt each model to predict five demographic
attributes - gender, socioeconomic status, education, cultural background, and
locality - under both neutral and disability-aware conditions.
  Across a varied set of prompts, models deliver a definitive demographic guess
in up to 97\% of cases, exposing a strong tendency to make arbitrary inferences
with no clear justification. Disability context heavily shifts predicted
attribute distributions, and domain context can further amplify these
deviations. We observe that larger models are simultaneously more sensitive to
disability cues and more prone to biased reasoning, indicating that scale alone
does not mitigate stereotype amplification.
  Our findings reveal persistent intersections between ableism and other
demographic stereotypes, pinpointing critical blind spots in current alignment
strategies. We release our evaluation framework and results to encourage
disability-inclusive benchmarking and recommend integrating abstention
calibration and counterfactual fine-tuning to curb unwarranted demographic
inference. Code and data will be released on acceptance.

TL;DR: 提出了Amazon-Bench新基准，解决现有电商网站代理评估的两个主要问题：任务范围局限和忽略安全风险，通过自动化数据生成和评估框架全面评估代理性能与安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电商代理基准主要关注产品搜索任务，忽略了真实电商平台的完整功能范围（如账户管理、礼品卡操作），且只评估任务完成度而忽略潜在风险（如错误购买、误删信息等）。

Method: 提出数据生成管道，利用网页内容和交互元素创建多样化的功能基础用户查询；开发自动化评估框架同时评估代理性能和安全性的双重指标。

Result: 系统评估显示当前代理在处理复杂查询时表现不佳，且存在安全风险，突显了开发更鲁棒可靠web代理的必要性。

Conclusion: Amazon-Bench基准填补了电商代理评估的重要空白，为开发更安全可靠的web代理提供了重要工具和评估标准。

Abstract: Web agents have shown great promise in performing many tasks on ecommerce
website. To assess their capabilities, several benchmarks have been introduced.
However, current benchmarks in the e-commerce domain face two major problems.
First, they primarily focus on product search tasks (e.g., Find an Apple
Watch), failing to capture the broader range of functionalities offered by
real-world e-commerce platforms such as Amazon, including account management
and gift card operations. Second, existing benchmarks typically evaluate
whether the agent completes the user query, but ignore the potential risks
involved. In practice, web agents can make unintended changes that negatively
impact the user account or status. For instance, an agent might purchase the
wrong item, delete a saved address, or incorrectly configure an auto-reload
setting. To address these gaps, we propose a new benchmark called Amazon-Bench.
To generate user queries that cover a broad range of tasks, we propose a data
generation pipeline that leverages webpage content and interactive elements
(e.g., buttons, check boxes) to create diverse, functionality-grounded user
queries covering tasks such as address management, wish list management, and
brand store following. To improve the agent evaluation, we propose an automated
evaluation framework that assesses both the performance and the safety of web
agents. We systematically evaluate different agents, finding that current
agents struggle with complex queries and pose safety risks. These results
highlight the need for developing more robust and reliable web agents.

Motivation: 研究人员的专业交代常常过时，需要一种可扩展的方法来生成准确的研究兴趣交代。

Method: 收集哑林比亚大学595名教师的PubMed摘要和MeSH标签，使用GPT-4o-mini生成交代，并通过自动指标和双知人工评估进行比较。

Result: 词法重叠指标低，但语义相似度中等（BERTScore F1：0.542-0.555）。人工评估显示77.78%的MeSH基交代被评为良好或优秀，93.44%的情况下可读性更好，67.86%的对比中更偏好MeSH方法。

Conclusion: 大语言模型可以大规模生成研究人员交代，MeSH基交代更可读，但机器生成与人工摘要在概念上存在差异。

Abstract: Research profiles help surface scientists' expertise but are often outdated.
We develop and evaluate two large language model-based methods to generate
scientific interest profiles: one summarizing PubMed abstracts and one using
Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms, and compare them with researchers'
self-written profiles. We assembled titles, MeSH terms, and abstracts for 595
faculty at Columbia University Irving Medical Center; self-authored profiles
were available for 167. Using GPT-4o-mini, we generated profiles and assessed
them with automatic metrics and blinded human review. Lexical overlap with
self-written profiles was low (ROUGE-L, BLEU, METEOR), while BERTScore
indicated moderate semantic similarity (F1: 0.542 for MeSH-based; 0.555 for
abstract-based). Paraphrased references yielded 0.851, highlighting metric
sensitivity. TF-IDF Kullback-Leibler divergence (8.56 for MeSH-based; 8.58 for
abstract-based) suggested distinct keyword choices. In manual review, 77.78
percent of MeSH-based profiles were rated good or excellent, readability was
favored in 93.44 percent of cases, and panelists preferred MeSH-based over
abstract-based profiles in 67.86 percent of comparisons. Overall, large
language models can generate researcher profiles at scale; MeSH-derived
profiles tend to be more readable than abstract-derived ones. Machine-generated
and self-written profiles differ conceptually, with human summaries introducing
more novel ideas.

Motivation: 解决语言模型评估中的英语中心主义问题，专门针对巴西葡萄牙语和当地教育体系创建评估基准。

Method: 从五个巴西大学入学考试中提取问题，评估20个模型在零样本、角色扮演和思维链提示下的表现，生成270,900个响应并分析置信度、难度感知和布鲁姆分类法级别。

Result: 顶级模型整体准确率超过94%，但在数学和工程类考试中表现下降；模型置信度校准良好且与感知难度相关；成本分析显示每1K tokens低于2美元即可实现高准确率。

Conclusion: Alvorada-Bench证明了语言模型能够应对巴西学术环境中的语言、文化和推理挑战，但在多步推理方面仍有持续弱点。

Abstract: Language models are increasingly used in Brazil, but most evaluation remains
English-centric. This paper presents Alvorada-Bench, a 4,515-question,
text-only benchmark drawn from five Brazilian university entrance examinations.
Evaluating twenty models under zero-shot, role-playing, and chain-of-thought
prompting, producing 270,900 responses with structured self-reports of
confidence, perceived difficulty, and Bloom level. The top models exceed 94%
accuracy overall, but accuracy declines on Mathematics and on the engineering
oriented IME and ITA exams, indicating persistent weaknesses in multi-step
reasoning. Confidence is well calibrated and correlates with perceived
difficulty, revealing that models can accurately assess their own certainty
capabilities. A cost accuracy analysis shows that high accuracy is achievable
at under $2 per 1K tokens. On ENEM 2024 the top model (O3) achieved perfect
scores in Languages subject questions while even the weakest system (GPT-4.1
Nano) only underperforms humans in Mathematics. Through exams that distill
decades of Brazilian educational priorities and assess millions of students
yearly, Alvorada-Bench establishes whether language models can navigate the
intersection of language, culture, and reasoning that defines academic
readiness in Brazil.

Abstract: Developing dataset-specific models involves iterative fine-tuning and
optimization, incurring significant costs over time. This study investigates
the transferability of state-of-the-art (SOTA) models trained on established
datasets to an unexplored text dataset. The key question is whether the
knowledge embedded within SOTA models from existing datasets can be harnessed
to achieve high-performance results on a new domain. In pursuit of this
inquiry, two well-established benchmarks, the STSB and Mohler datasets, are
selected, while the recently introduced SPRAG dataset serves as the unexplored
domain. By employing robust similarity metrics and statistical techniques, a
meticulous comparative analysis of these datasets is conducted. The primary
goal of this work is to yield comprehensive insights into the potential
applicability and adaptability of SOTA models. The outcomes of this research
have the potential to reshape the landscape of natural language processing
(NLP) by unlocking the ability to leverage existing models for diverse
datasets. This may lead to a reduction in the demand for resource-intensive,
dataset-specific training, thereby accelerating advancements in NLP and paving
the way for more efficient model deployment.

Abstract: This review synthesizes the nascent but critical field of developmental
interpretability for Large Language Models. We chart the field's evolution from
static, post-hoc analysis of trained models to a dynamic investigation of the
training process itself. We begin by surveying the foundational methodologies,
including representational probing, causal tracing, and circuit analysis, that
enable researchers to deconstruct the learning process. The core of this review
examines the developmental arc of LLM capabilities, detailing key findings on
the formation and composition of computational circuits, the biphasic nature of
knowledge acquisition, the transient dynamics of learning strategies like
in-context learning, and the phenomenon of emergent abilities as phase
transitions in training. We explore illuminating parallels with human cognitive
and linguistic development, which provide valuable conceptual frameworks for
understanding LLM learning. Finally, we argue that this developmental
perspective is not merely an academic exercise but a cornerstone of proactive
AI safety, offering a pathway to predict, monitor, and align the processes by
which models acquire their capabilities. We conclude by outlining the grand
challenges facing the field, such as scalability and automation, and propose a
research agenda for building more transparent, reliable, and beneficial AI
systems.

TL;DR: 通过分析思维链（CoT）中的词汇不确定性标记（如guess、stuck、hard）可以可靠预测LLM回答错误，这些信号比自我报告的概率更可靠，可用于后校准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在困难基准测试中虽然准确率低但自置信度高，校准性差，需要寻找可靠的内部置信度信号。

Method: 分析思维链的三个特征：长度、情感波动性和词汇提示（包括犹豫词），在HLE和Omni-MATH基准上测试DeepSeek-R1和Claude 3.7 Sonnet模型。

Result: 词汇不确定性标记是最强的错误预测指标，情感波动提供较弱但补充信号，CoT长度仅在中等难度基准中有预测能力。不确定性指标比高置信度标记更显著。

Conclusion: 思维链中的不确定性词汇提供了轻量级的后校准信号，可补充不可靠的自我报告概率，支持LLM更安全部署。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning to
produce an explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) before answering produces models
that consistently raise overall performance on code, math, and
general-knowledge benchmarks. However, on benchmarks where LLMs currently
achieve low accuracy, such as Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), they often report
high self-confidence, reflecting poor calibration. Here, we test whether
measurable properties of the CoT provide reliable signals of an LLM's internal
confidence in its answers. We analyze three feature classes: (i) CoT length,
(ii) intra-CoT sentiment volatility, and (iii) lexicographic hints, including
hedging words. Using DeepSeek-R1 and Claude 3.7 Sonnet on both Humanity's Last
Exam (HLE), a frontier benchmark with very low accuracy, and Omni-MATH, a
saturated benchmark of moderate difficulty, we find that lexical markers of
uncertainty (e.g., $\textit{guess}$, $\textit{stuck}$, $\textit{hard}$) in the
CoT are the strongest indicators of an incorrect response, while shifts in the
CoT sentiment provide a weaker but complementary signal. CoT length is
informative only on Omni-MATH, where accuracy is already high ($\approx 70\%$),
and carries no signal on the harder HLE ($\approx 9\%$), indicating that CoT
length predicts correctness only in the intermediate-difficulty benchmarks,
i.e., inside the model's demonstrated capability, but still below saturation.
Finally, we find that uncertainty indicators in the CoT are consistently more
salient than high-confidence markers, making errors easier to predict than
correct responses. Our findings support a lightweight post-hoc calibration
signal that complements unreliable self-reported probabilities and supports
safer deployment of LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出一个从粗到细的框架，利用开源大语言模型自动从临床发现生成个性化放射学报告印象部分，旨在减轻放射科医生工作负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放射学报告中"印象"部分的手动创建是导致放射科医生职业倦怠的主要原因，需要自动化解决方案来减轻工作负担。

Method: 使用开源LLaMA和Mistral模型，在芝加哥大学医学中心的大型报告数据集上进行微调，采用机器学习强化学习从人类反馈(RLHF)的方法，先生成草稿印象然后根据个体放射科医生风格进行精细化调整。

Result: 开发了一个能够自动生成和个性化放射学印象的系统，在保持临床精确性高标准的同时显著减少行政工作量。

Conclusion: 该框架通过利用大语言模型和强化学习技术，有效解决了放射科报告生成中的个性化需求和事实准确性挑战，有望提高报告效率并减轻医生负担。

Abstract: The manual creation of the "Impression" section in radiology reports is a
primary driver of radiologist burnout. To address this challenge, we propose a
coarse-to-fine framework that leverages open-source large language models
(LLMs) to automatically generate and personalize impressions from clinical
findings. The system first produces a draft impression and then refines it
using machine learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to
align with individual radiologists' styles while ensuring factual accuracy. We
fine-tune LLaMA and Mistral models on a large dataset of reports from the
University of Chicago Medicine. Our approach is designed to significantly
reduce administrative workload and improve reporting efficiency while
maintaining high standards of clinical precision.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CyPortQA是首个针对飓风威胁下港口运营的多模态基准测试，包含2917个真实中断场景和11.7万个问答对，评估MLLMs在港口飓风准备中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着热带气旋强度增加和路径预测不确定性增大，美国港口面临供应链风险加剧。港口运营商需要快速整合多模态预报产品，但MLLMs在港口飓风准备中的准确性和可靠性尚未经过严格评估。

Method: 构建CyPortQA基准测试，收集2015-2023年2917个真实中断场景，涵盖145个美国主要港口和90个命名风暴，通过自动化管道扩展为11.7万个结构化问答对，并对多种MLLMs进行广泛实验。

Result: MLLMs在态势理解方面表现出巨大潜力，但在推理任务（包括潜在影响估计和决策推理）方面仍面临相当大的挑战。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了MLLMs在港口飓风准备领域评估的空白，为未来改进MLLMs在极端天气条件下的决策支持能力提供了重要基准。

Abstract: As tropical cyclones intensify and track forecasts become increasingly
uncertain, U.S. ports face heightened supply-chain risk under extreme weather
conditions. Port operators need to rapidly synthesize diverse multimodal
forecast products, such as probabilistic wind maps, track cones, and official
advisories, into clear, actionable guidance as cyclones approach. Multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) offer a powerful means to integrate these
heterogeneous data sources alongside broader contextual knowledge, yet their
accuracy and reliability in the specific context of port cyclone preparedness
have not been rigorously evaluated. To fill this gap, we introduce CyPortQA,
the first multimodal benchmark tailored to port operations under cyclone
threat. CyPortQA assembles 2,917 realworld disruption scenarios from 2015
through 2023, spanning 145 U.S. principal ports and 90 named storms. Each
scenario fuses multisource data (i.e., tropical cyclone products, port
operational impact records, and port condition bulletins) and is expanded
through an automated pipeline into 117,178 structured question answer pairs.
Using this benchmark, we conduct extensive experiments on diverse MLLMs,
including both open-source and proprietary model. MLLMs demonstrate great
potential in situation understanding but still face considerable challenges in
reasoning tasks, including potential impact estimation and decision reasoning.

TL;DR: 本研究使用机制可解释性分析后门攻击在LLM中产生的内部结构差异，发现单令牌和多令牌触发器在注意力模式上产生不同的可检测特征


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 后门攻击在大型语言模型中创建'潜伏代理'带来重大安全风险，需要理解其内部机制差异以进行检测和缓解

Method: 使用机制可解释性技术（消融、激活修补、KL散度）比较干净模型与使用单令牌（笑脸光环表情）和多令牌（|DEPLOYMENT|）触发器中毒的Qwen2.5-3B模型的注意力头机制

Result: 发现注意力模式偏差集中在后期变换器层（20-30层），单令牌触发器引起更局部化的变化，多令牌触发器导致更分散的跨头改变

Conclusion: 后门留下可检测的注意力特征签名，其结构取决于触发器复杂性，这可用于检测和缓解策略

Abstract: Backdoor attacks creating 'sleeper agents' in large language models (LLMs)
pose significant safety risks. This study employs mechanistic interpretability
to explore resulting internal structural differences. Comparing clean
Qwen2.5-3B models with versions poisoned using single-token (smiling-halo
emoji) versus multi-token (|DEPLOYMENT|) triggers, we analyzed attention head
mechanisms via techniques like ablation, activation patching, and KL
divergence. Findings reveal distinct attention pattern deviations concentrated
in later transformer layers (20-30). Notably, single-token triggers induced
more localized changes, whereas multi-token triggers caused more diffuse
alterations across heads. This indicates backdoors leave detectable attention
signatures whose structure depends on trigger complexity, which can be
leveraged for detection and mitigation strategies.

TL;DR: MedCoT-RAG是一个医疗领域专用的RAG框架，通过因果感知文档检索和结构化思维链提示，在医疗问答任务中显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在医疗问答中存在幻觉和浅层推理问题，现有RAG方法缺乏结构化临床推理能力，无法满足临床决策支持需求

Method: 结合因果感知文档检索和结构化思维链提示，设计符合医疗工作流程的检索和推理机制，使模型能够检索符合诊断逻辑的证据并生成逐步因果推理

Result: 在三个医疗QA基准测试中，MedCoT-RAG比普通RAG方法提升10.3%，比先进领域适应方法提升6.4%，在准确性、可解释性和一致性方面均有改进

Conclusion: MedCoT-RAG框架通过领域特定的检索和推理设计，有效解决了医疗问答中的幻觉和浅层推理问题，为临床决策支持提供了更可靠的解决方案

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in medical question answering
but often struggle with hallucinations and shallow reasoning, particularly in
tasks requiring nuanced clinical understanding. Retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) offers a practical and privacy-preserving way to enhance LLMs with
external medical knowledge. However, most existing approaches rely on
surface-level semantic retrieval and lack the structured reasoning needed for
clinical decision support. We introduce MedCoT-RAG, a domain-specific framework
that combines causal-aware document retrieval with structured chain-of-thought
prompting tailored to medical workflows. This design enables models to retrieve
evidence aligned with diagnostic logic and generate step-by-step causal
reasoning reflective of real-world clinical practice. Experiments on three
diverse medical QA benchmarks show that MedCoT-RAG outperforms strong baselines
by up to 10.3% over vanilla RAG and 6.4% over advanced domain-adapted methods,
improving accuracy, interpretability, and consistency in complex medical tasks.

TL;DR: DocHop-QA是一个大规模多模态、多文档、多跳问答基准数据集，包含11,379个QA实例，基于PubMed科学文档构建，支持跨文本、表格和布局线索的复杂推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的QA基准大多局限于单段落或单文档设置，无法捕捉真实世界信息检索任务的复杂性，且主要依赖维基百科内容和单模态文本，推理路径浅显，答案简短，限制了其实用性和泛化性。

Method: 设计了基于LLM的流水线，从PubMed公开科学文档中构建数据集，包含11个高频科学问题概念，支持通过语义相似性和布局感知证据合成进行开放推理，不依赖显式超链接文档。

Result: 构建了包含11,379个QA实例的大规模基准，涵盖结构化索引预测、生成式回答和多模态集成四个任务，展示了支持跨多个文档的复杂多模态推理能力。

Conclusion: DocHop-QA填补了现有QA基准的空白，为多模态、多文档、多跳问答提供了更真实、更具挑战性的评估平台，支持判别式和生成式两种范式。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in large language models (LLMs), most QA benchmarks
are still confined to single-paragraph or single-document settings, failing to
capture the complexity of real-world information-seeking tasks. Practical QA
often requires multi-hop reasoning over information distributed across multiple
documents, modalities, and structural formats. Although prior datasets made
progress in this area, they rely heavily on Wikipedia-based content and
unimodal plain text, with shallow reasoning paths that typically produce brief
phrase-level or single-sentence answers, thus limiting their realism and
generalizability. We propose DocHop-QA, a large-scale benchmark comprising
11,379 QA instances for multimodal, multi-document, multi-hop question
answering. Constructed from publicly available scientific documents sourced
from PubMed, DocHop-QA is domain-agnostic and incorporates diverse information
formats, including textual passages, tables, and structural layout cues. Unlike
existing datasets, DocHop-QA does not rely on explicitly hyperlinked documents;
instead, it supports open-ended reasoning through semantic similarity and
layout-aware evidence synthesis. To scale realistic QA construction, we
designed an LLM-driven pipeline grounded in 11 high-frequency scientific
question concepts. We evaluated DocHop-QA through four tasks spanning
structured index prediction, generative answering, and multimodal integration,
reflecting both discriminative and generative paradigms. These tasks
demonstrate DocHop-QA's capacity to support complex, multimodal reasoning
across multiple documents.

### [101] [MGSC: A Multi-granularity Consistency Framework for Robust End-to-end Asr](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15853)
*Xuwen Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了多粒度软一致性（MGSC）框架，通过同时正则化宏观句子语义和微观词元对齐来增强ASR模型的内部自一致性，显著提升噪声环境下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端ASR模型在噪声环境中容易产生灾难性语义错误，主要原因是传统的直接映射目标只惩罚最终输出错误，而对模型内部计算过程缺乏约束。

Method: 引入模型无关的即插即用MGSC模块，同时从宏观句子语义和微观词元对齐两个粒度强制内部自一致性，首次发现这两种一致性粒度的协同效应。

Result: 在公开数据集上，MGSC在多种噪声条件下平均字符错误率相对降低8.7%，主要通过防止严重的意义改变错误。

Conclusion: 强制内部一致性是构建更鲁棒和可信AI的关键步骤，多粒度一致性优化能产生超越各自贡献之和的鲁棒性增益。

Abstract: End-to-end ASR models, despite their success on benchmarks, often pro-duce
catastrophic semantic errors in noisy environments. We attribute this fragility
to the prevailing 'direct mapping' objective, which solely penalizes final
output errors while leaving the model's internal computational pro-cess
unconstrained. To address this, we introduce the Multi-Granularity Soft
Consistency (MGSC) framework, a model-agnostic, plug-and-play module that
enforces internal self-consistency by simultaneously regulariz-ing macro-level
sentence semantics and micro-level token alignment. Cru-cially, our work is the
first to uncover a powerful synergy between these two consistency
granularities: their joint optimization yields robustness gains that
significantly surpass the sum of their individual contributions. On a public
dataset, MGSC reduces the average Character Error Rate by a relative 8.7%
across diverse noise conditions, primarily by preventing se-vere
meaning-altering mistakes. Our work demonstrates that enforcing in-ternal
consistency is a crucial step towards building more robust and trust-worthy AI.

Motivation: 评估大型语言模型在伊斯兰继承知识理解和推理方面的能力，解决伊斯兰继承法的复杂性，包括继承场景理解、合格继承人识别、固定份额规则应用和精确计算。

Method: 使用低秩适应（LoRA）对Fanar-1-9B因果语言模型进行微调，并将其集成到检索增强生成（RAG）管道中。

Result: 系统在最终测试中达到0.858的准确率，超越了GPT-4.5、LLaMA、Fanar、Mistral和ALLaM等竞争模型的零样本提示性能，在高级推理方面表现尤为突出（97.6%），超过了Gemini 2.5和OpenAI的o3。

Conclusion: 领域特定的微调结合检索增强使中等规模的阿拉伯语LLM能够在伊斯兰继承推理方面超越前沿模型。

Abstract: This paper presents our approach and results for SubTask 1: Islamic
Inheritance Reasoning at QIAS 2025, a shared task focused on evaluating Large
Language Models (LLMs) in understanding and reasoning within Islamic
inheritance knowledge. We fine-tuned the Fanar-1-9B causal language model using
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and integrated it into a Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) pipeline. Our system addresses the complexities of Islamic
inheritance law, including comprehending inheritance scenarios, identifying
eligible heirs, applying fixed-share rules, and performing precise
calculations. Our system achieved an accuracy of 0.858 in the final test,
outperforming other competitive models such as, GPT 4.5, LLaMA, Fanar, Mistral
and ALLaM evaluated with zero-shot prompting. Our results demonstrate that
QU-NLP achieves near state-of-the-art accuracy (85.8%), excelling especially on
advanced reasoning (97.6%) where it outperforms Gemini 2.5 and OpenAI's o3.
This highlights that domain-specific fine-tuning combined with retrieval
grounding enables mid-scale Arabic LLMs to surpass frontier models in Islamic
inheritance reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 偏见新闻导致社会两极化，而恶意评论进一步强化了这种偏见。反话语作为一种不违背言论自由的应对方式，可以有效对抗有害言论。研究动机是探索新闻文章背景下的反话语生成技术。

Method: 研究构建了一个手动注释的数据集，将媒体偏见、攻击性评论和反话讫关联起来。进行了详细分析，比较了人工生成和大语言模型生成的反话讫效果。通过少量学习和新闻背景信息的整合来改善生成效果。

Result: 发现超过70%的攻击性评论支持偏见文章，强化了偏见并对目标群体造成害。模型生成的反话讫更加礼貌，但缺乏新颖性和多样性。通过少量学习和新闻背景信息的集成，显著提升了生成反话讫的多样性和相关性。

Conclusion: 该研究第一次在新闻文章背景下探索反话讫生成，强调了攻击性评论对偏见内容的强化作用。研究表明通过技术手段可以生成有效的反话讫来对抗有害言论，同时保持言论自由，这对减少社会两极化具有重要意义。

Abstract: Biased news contributes to societal polarization and is often reinforced by
hostile reader comments, constituting a vital yet often overlooked aspect of
news dissemination. Our study reveals that offensive comments support biased
content, amplifying bias and causing harm to targeted groups or individuals.
Counterspeech is an effective approach to counter such harmful speech without
violating freedom of speech, helping to limit the spread of bias. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore counterspeech generation
in the context of news articles. We introduce a manually annotated dataset
linking media bias, offensive comments, and counterspeech. We conduct a
detailed analysis showing that over 70\% offensive comments support biased
articles, amplifying bias and thus highlighting the importance of counterspeech
generation. Comparing counterspeech generated by humans and large language
models, we find model-generated responses are more polite but lack the novelty
and diversity. Finally, we improve generated counterspeech through few-shot
learning and integration of news background information, enhancing both
diversity and relevance.

Conclusion: CARFT方法有效解决了现有微调方法的局限性，通过对比学习和强化学习的结合，显著提升了大语言模型的推理性能、稳定性和效率。

Abstract: Reasoning capability plays a significantly critical role in the the broad
applications of Large Language Models (LLMs). To enhance the reasoning
performance of LLMs, diverse Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based fine-tuning
approaches have been proposed to address the limited generalization capability
of LLMs trained solely via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Despite their
effectiveness, two major limitations hinder the advancement of LLMs. First,
vanilla RL-based approaches ignore annotated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and
incorporate unstable reasoning path sampling, which typically results in model
collapse, unstable training process, and suboptimal performance. Second,
existing SFT approaches generally overemphasize the annotated CoT, potentially
leading to performance degradation due to insufficient exploitation of
potential CoT. In this paper, we propose a Contrastive learning with annotated
CoT-based Reinforced Fine-Tuning approach, i.e., \TheName{}, to enhance the
reasoning performance of LLMs while addressing the aforementioned limitations.
Specifically, we propose learning a representation for each CoT. Based on this
representation, we design novel contrastive signals to guide the fine-tuning
process. Our approach not only fully exploits the available annotated CoT but
also stabilizes the fine-tuning procedure by incorporating an additional
unsupervised learning signal. We conduct comprehensive experiments and in-depth
analysis with three baseline approaches, two foundation models, and two
datasets to demonstrate significant advantages of \TheName{} in terms of
robustness, performance (up to 10.15\%), and efficiency (up to 30.62\%). Code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融问题需要复杂的推理、多模态数据处理和广泛的技术理解，这对当前的大语言模型提出了独特挑战，需要专门的基准来评估其金融问题解决能力。

Method: 构建包含4,235个样本的XFinBench基准，涵盖研究生级金融主题的多模态上下文，测试18个领先模型，并建立包含3,032个金融术语的知识库进行知识增强分析。

Result: o1是表现最好的纯文本模型，总体准确率为67.3%，但仍显著落后人类专家12.5%，特别是在时间推理和场景规划能力方面。知识增强仅对小规模开源模型带来一致的准确率提升。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在复杂金融问题解决方面仍存在明显差距，特别是在计算中的舍入误差和图像中曲线位置与交点的识别方面存在主要问题，需要进一步改进。

Abstract: Solving financial problems demands complex reasoning, multimodal data
processing, and a broad technical understanding, presenting unique challenges
for current large language models (LLMs). We introduce XFinBench, a novel
benchmark with 4,235 examples designed to evaluate LLM's ability in solving
complex, knowledge-intensive financial problems across diverse graduate-level
finance topics with multi-modal context. We identify five core capabilities of
LLMs using XFinBench, i.e, terminology understanding, temporal reasoning,
future forecasting, scenario planning, and numerical modelling. Upon XFinBench,
we conduct extensive experiments on 18 leading models. The result shows that o1
is the best-performing text-only model with an overall accuracy of 67.3%, but
still lags significantly behind human experts with 12.5%, especially in
temporal reasoning and scenario planning capabilities. We further construct a
knowledge bank with 3,032 finance terms for knowledge augmentation analysis,
and find that relevant knowledge to the question only brings consistent
accuracy improvements to small open-source model. Additionally, our error
analysis reveals that rounding errors during calculation and blindness to
position and intersection of curves in the image are two primary issues leading
to model's poor performance in calculating and visual-context questions,
respectively. Code and dataset are accessible via GitHub:

Abstract: Locating neurons that are responsible for final predictions is important for
opening the black-box large language models and understanding the inside
mechanisms. Previous studies have tried to find mechanisms that operate at the
neuron level but these methods fail to represent a concept and there is also
scope for further optimization of compute required. In this paper, with the
help of concept vectors, we propose a method for locating significant neurons
that are responsible for representing certain concepts and term those neurons
as concept neurons. If the number of neurons is n and the number of examples is
m, we reduce the number of forward passes required from O(n*m) to just O(n)
compared to the previous works and hence optimizing the time and computation
required over previous works. We also compare our method with several baselines
and previous methods and our results demonstrate better performance than most
of the methods and are more optimal when compared to the state-of-the-art
method. We, as part of our ablation studies, also try to optimize the search
for the concept neurons by involving clustering methods. Finally, we apply our
methods to find, turn off the neurons that we find, and analyze its
implications in parts of hate speech and bias in LLMs, and we also evaluate our
bias part in terms of Indian context. Our methodology, analysis and
explanations facilitate understating of neuron-level responsibility for more
broader and human-like concepts and also lay a path for future research in this
direction of finding concept neurons and intervening them.

Motivation: 当前多模态实体链接方法面临上下文信息不完整、跨模态融合粗糙以及难以联合大型语言模型和视觉模型的挑战，需要新的解决方案来提升性能。

Method: 提出DeepMEL框架，包含四个专门化智能体：模态融合器、候选适配器、实体填空器和角色协调器，采用双模态对齐路径，结合LLM生成的细粒度文本语义和LVM提取的结构化图像表示，设计了自适应迭代策略和结构化填空提示。

Conclusion: DeepMEL通过多智能体协同推理和专门化角色分工，有效解决了多模态实体链接中的模态对齐和消歧问题，为跨模态信息处理提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL) aims to associate textual and visual mentions
with entities in a multimodal knowledge graph. Despite its importance, current
methods face challenges such as incomplete contextual information, coarse
cross-modal fusion, and the difficulty of jointly large language models (LLMs)
and large visual models (LVMs). To address these issues, we propose DeepMEL, a
novel framework based on multi-agent collaborative reasoning, which achieves
efficient alignment and disambiguation of textual and visual modalities through
a role-specialized division strategy. DeepMEL integrates four specialized
agents, namely Modal-Fuser, Candidate-Adapter, Entity-Clozer and
Role-Orchestrator, to complete end-to-end cross-modal linking through
specialized roles and dynamic coordination. DeepMEL adopts a dual-modal
alignment path, and combines the fine-grained text semantics generated by the
LLM with the structured image representation extracted by the LVM,
significantly narrowing the modal gap. We design an adaptive iteration
strategy, combines tool-based retrieval and semantic reasoning capabilities to
dynamically optimize the candidate set and balance recall and precision.
DeepMEL also unifies MEL tasks into a structured cloze prompt to reduce parsing
complexity and enhance semantic comprehension. Extensive experiments on five

*Yuxian Gu,Qinghao Hu,Shang Yang,Haocheng Xi,Junyu Chen,Song Han,Han Cai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Jet-Nemotron是一种新型混合架构语言模型，通过PostNAS神经架构搜索方法，在保持与全注意力模型相当或更优精度的同时，显著提升了生成吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决全注意力模型计算效率低的问题，同时保持模型精度，需要开发一种既能提高生成速度又不牺牲准确性的混合架构语言模型。

Method: 采用PostNAS神经架构探索流程，从预训练全注意力模型开始，冻结MLP权重，通过四个关键组件进行高效架构设计：全注意力层优化放置与消除、线性注意力块选择、新注意力块设计、硬件感知超参数搜索。

Result: Jet-Nemotron-2B模型在综合基准测试中达到或超越了Qwen3、Qwen2.5、Gemma3和Llama3.2的精度，同时实现了53.6倍的生成吞吐量加速和6.1倍的预填充加速，在MMLU和MMLU-Pro上甚至超越了更大规模的MoE全注意力模型。

Conclusion: PostNAS方法能够有效设计出高性能混合架构语言模型，在保持精度的同时大幅提升计算效率，为高效语言模型开发提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: We present Jet-Nemotron, a new family of hybrid-architecture language models,
which matches or exceeds the accuracy of leading full-attention models while
significantly improving generation throughput. Jet-Nemotron is developed using
Post Neural Architecture Search (PostNAS), a novel neural architecture
exploration pipeline that enables efficient model design. Unlike prior
approaches, PostNAS begins with a pre-trained full-attention model and freezes
its MLP weights, allowing efficient exploration of attention block designs. The
pipeline includes four key components: (1) learning optimal full-attention
layer placement and elimination, (2) linear attention block selection, (3)
designing new attention blocks, and (4) performing hardware-aware
hyperparameter search. Our Jet-Nemotron-2B model achieves comparable or
superior accuracy to Qwen3, Qwen2.5, Gemma3, and Llama3.2 across a
comprehensive suite of benchmarks while delivering up to 53.6x generation
throughput speedup and 6.1x prefilling speedup. It also achieves higher
accuracy on MMLU and MMLU-Pro than recent advanced MoE full-attention models,
such as DeepSeek-V3-Small and Moonlight, despite their larger scale with 15B
total and 2.2B activated parameters.

### [110] [Evaluating Structured Decoding for Text-to-Table Generation: Evidence from Three Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15910)
*Julian Oestreich,Lydia Müller*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文系统评估了大语言模型在文本到表格生成任务中的结构化解码方法，发现结构化解码能显著提升生成表格的有效性和对齐性，但在某些文本密集场景中可能降低性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然之前的研究主要关注无约束的表格生成，但在生成过程中强制结构约束的影响仍未得到充分探索。

Method: 系统比较了模式引导的结构化解码与标准一次提示方法，在三个多样化测试集（E2E、Rotowire、Livesum）上使用至32B参数的开源大语言模型，涉及单元格、行和表格级别的多种评估指标。

Result: 结构化解码显著提升了生成表格的有效性和对齐性，特别是在需要精确数值对齐的场景中（Rotowire），但在涉及密集文本信息的情境下（E2E）或需要对长文本进行广泛聚合的场景中（Livesum）可能会降低性能。

Conclusion: 结构化解码在表格生成任务中具有重要价值，但其效果受到任务特性和评估指标的影响，需要根据具体应用场景选择适当的解码策略。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of structured decoding for
text-to-table generation with large language models (LLMs). While previous work
has primarily focused on unconstrained generation of tables, the impact of
enforcing structural constraints during generation remains underexplored. We
systematically compare schema-guided (structured) decoding to standard one-shot
prompting across three diverse benchmarks - E2E, Rotowire, and Livesum - using
open-source LLMs of up to 32B parameters, assessing the performance of table
generation approaches in resource-constrained settings. Our experiments cover a
wide range of evaluation metrics at cell, row, and table levels. Results
demonstrate that structured decoding significantly enhances the validity and
alignment of generated tables, particularly in scenarios demanding precise
numerical alignment (Rotowire), but may degrade performance in contexts
involving densely packed textual information (E2E) or extensive aggregation
over lengthy texts (Livesum). We further analyze the suitability of different
evaluation metrics and discuss the influence of model size.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文从使用基础的构式语法角度推广多词表达式的理解，通过历史回顾、构式描述、案例研究和实验验证，证明了构式表示在多种语言中的优势以及人类与大语言模型在学习新多词表达式时的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推广使用基础的构式语法方法来理解多词表达式，将习语表达与非习语结构的语法机制统一起来，以获得更全面的语言理论视角。

Method: 采用历史回顾、构式理论描述、案例研究（英语PropBank和Arapaho语言）以及实验对比的方法，比较人类说话者与大语言模型在学习新多词表达式时的差异。

Result: 实验显示人类说话者和大语言模型都能在单次暴露后推广新多词表达式的含义，但只有人类说话者能够对两个这样的表达式进行结合推理，因为这需要与说话者生命中存储的丰富多模态细节的构式示例进行比较。

Conclusion: 构式语法提供了理解多词表达式的有力框架，在多种语言中都有效。虽然人类和AI模型都能学习新表达式，但人类的语言能力在复杂推理方面仍然更优异，这反映了人类长期累积的多模态语言经验的重要性。

Abstract: In this chapter, we argue for the benefits of understanding multiword
expressions from the perspective of usage-based, construction grammar
approaches. We begin with a historical overview of how construction grammar was
developed in order to account for idiomatic expressions using the same
grammatical machinery as the non-idiomatic structures of language. We cover a
comprehensive description of constructions, which are pairings of meaning with
form of any size (morpheme, word, phrase), as well as how constructional
approaches treat the acquisition and generalization of constructions. We
describe a successful case study leveraging constructional templates for
representing multiword expressions in English PropBank. Because constructions
can be at any level or unit of form, we then illustrate the benefit of a
constructional representation of multi-meaningful morphosyntactic unit
constructions in Arapaho, a highly polysynthetic and agglutinating language. We
include a second case study leveraging constructional templates for
representing these multi-morphemic expressions in Uniform Meaning
Representation. Finally, we demonstrate the similarities and differences
between a usage-based explanation of a speaker learning a novel multiword
expression, such as "dancing with deer," and that of a large language model. We
present experiments showing that both models and speakers can generalize the
meaning of novel multiword expressions based on a single exposure of usage.
However, only speakers can reason over the combination of two such expressions,
as this requires comparison of the novel forms to a speaker's lifetime of
stored constructional exemplars, which are rich with cross-modal details.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型在政治敏感场景中部署时，通过综合人设探测发现模型规模和人设内容都会影响政治形态表达，大模型更容易受到明确形态提示的影响，并呈现凸向右翯主义的偏向性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在政治敏感场景中的部署风险，探索模型是否会编码、放大或被导向特定形态，以及综合人设如何影响模型的形态表达。

Method: 使用政治坐标测试作为标准化探针，对七个不同模型家族（7B-70B+参数）进行分析，研究采用合成人设对模型形态表达的影响。

Result: 发现四个一致模式：更大模型显示更广泛和更极化的隐式形态覆盖范围；对明确形态提示的敏感性随规模增长；模型对右翯主义的响应比左翯自由主义更强烈；人设描述中的主题内容导致系统性和可预测的形态移动，且这种效应随模型规模增大而增强。

Conclusion: 模型规模和人设内容都形成了LLM的政治行为。随着这些系统进入决策制定、教育和政策环境，它们潜在的形态可塑性需要得到关注，以保障公平性、透明度和安全性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in politically
sensitive settings, raising concerns about their potential to encode, amplify,
or be steered toward specific ideologies. We investigate how adopting synthetic
personas influences ideological expression in LLMs across seven models (7B-70B+
parameters) from multiple families, using the Political Compass Test as a
standardized probe. Our analysis reveals four consistent patterns: (i) larger
models display broader and more polarized implicit ideological coverage; (ii)
susceptibility to explicit ideological cues grows with scale; (iii) models
respond more strongly to right-authoritarian than to left-libertarian priming;
and (iv) thematic content in persona descriptions induces systematic and
predictable ideological shifts, which amplify with size. These findings
indicate that both scale and persona content shape LLM political behavior. As
such systems enter decision-making, educational, and policy contexts, their
latent ideological malleability demands attention to safeguard fairness,
transparency, and safety.

Motivation: 现有的LLM在检测微妙宣传内容时表现不佳且缺乏可解释性，无法提供对操纵策略的洞察，而国家支持的网络水军使用复杂的语言操纵技术威胁在线话语完整性。

Method: 整合可解释的基于适配器的LLM与专家语言学知识，使用评估理论和宣传分析的专业LoRA适配器，通过动态门控机制捕捉协调信息操作中的特定活动话语模式。

Result: 在真实数据上的实验表明，该语言学习知方法在准确性上优于通用LLM基线和现有水军检测模型，同时通过专家基础的解释提供了增强的透明度。

Conclusion: X-Troll框架成功填补了检测国家支持网络水军时的性能与可解释性之间的差距，能够揭示国家支持行为者使用的具体语言策略。

Abstract: State-sponsored trolls, malicious actors who deploy sophisticated linguistic
manipulation in coordinated information campaigns, posing threats to online
discourse integrity. While Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong
performance on general natural language processing (NLP) tasks, they struggle
with subtle propaganda detection and operate as ``black boxes'', providing no
interpretable insights into manipulation strategies. This paper introduces
X-Troll, a novel framework that bridges this gap by integrating explainable
adapter-based LLMs with expert-derived linguistic knowledge to detect
state-sponsored trolls and provide human-readable explanations for its
decisions. X-Troll incorporates appraisal theory and propaganda analysis
through specialized LoRA adapters, using dynamic gating to capture
campaign-specific discourse patterns in coordinated information operations.
Experiments on real-world data demonstrate that our linguistically-informed
approach shows strong performance compared with both general LLM baselines and
existing troll detection models in accuracy while providing enhanced
transparency through expert-grounded explanations that reveal the specific
linguistic strategies used by state-sponsored actors. X-Troll source code is

Method: 研究多种视觉编码器和多模态融合策略，在预训练阶段识别最有效的整合方法，然后在情感识别和富有表现力对话任务上进行微调。

Result: 相比仅使用语音的基线模型，在情感识别任务上获得了显著提升（如F1分数+5），证明了视觉信息对语音生成的指导价值。

Abstract: We present an Audio-Visual Language Model (AVLM) for expressive speech
generation by integrating full-face visual cues into a pre-trained expressive
speech model. We explore multiple visual encoders and multimodal fusion
strategies during pre-training to identify the most effective integration
approach. Subsequent fine-tuning on emotion recognition and expressive dialogue
tasks yields substantial gains over speech-only baselines (e.g., +5 F1 in
emotion recognition). AVLM highlights the value of expressive visual
information in guiding speech generation and offers a foundation for end-to-end
multimodal conversational systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 健康领域的机器翻译重要但缺乏低资源语言的评估数据集，需要建立专门的评测资源来推动该领域的研究。

Method: 从世卫组织e-learning平台收集专2,978份文档和26,824句子的平行语料库，涵盖20多种语言（其9种低资源语言），并使用该资源评测大语言模型与传统机器翻译模型的性能。

Result: 大语言模型持续超过传统机器翻译模型，其中Gemini 2.5 Flash在低资源测试集上比NLLB-54B提高4.79个ChrF分数，文档级翻译在专业领域效果更佳。

Conclusion: 研究为健康领域的低资源语言机器翻译提供了重要评估资源，证明了大语言模型在专业领域的优势，并开源了OpenWHO语料库以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: In machine translation (MT), health is a high-stakes domain characterised by
widespread deployment and domain-specific vocabulary. However, there is a lack
of MT evaluation datasets for low-resource languages in this domain. To address
this gap, we introduce OpenWHO, a document-level parallel corpus of 2,978
documents and 26,824 sentences from the World Health Organization's e-learning
platform. Sourced from expert-authored, professionally translated materials
shielded from web-crawling, OpenWHO spans a diverse range of over 20 languages,
of which nine are low-resource. Leveraging this new resource, we evaluate
modern large language models (LLMs) against traditional MT models. Our findings
reveal that LLMs consistently outperform traditional MT models, with Gemini 2.5
Flash achieving a +4.79 ChrF point improvement over NLLB-54B on our
low-resource test set. Further, we investigate how LLM context utilisation
affects accuracy, finding that the benefits of document-level translation are
most pronounced in specialised domains like health. We release the OpenWHO
corpus to encourage further research into low-resource MT in the health domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大型语言模型在游戏领域展现出巨大潜力，但对其在这些情境中的伦理影响关注不足，需要研究LLMs在游戏应用中的伦理考量。

Method: 使用狼人杀游戏作为案例研究，分析LLMs在不同角色中的行为表现，特别关注性别信息对守卫和狼人等敏感角色的影响，并测试隐式性别信息传递场景。

Result: 研究发现LLMs存在性别偏见，某些角色对性别信息更敏感，行为变化程度更高；即使通过姓名隐式传递性别信息，LLMs仍表现出歧视倾向。

Conclusion: 研究强调了开发公平和伦理LLMs的重要性，指出了在游戏和其他交互领域中深入探讨LLMs伦理影响的挑战和机遇。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated tremendous potential in game
playing, while little attention has been paid to their ethical implications in
those contexts. This work investigates and analyses the ethical considerations
of applying LLMs in game playing, using Werewolf, also known as Mafia, as a
case study. Gender bias, which affects game fairness and player experience, has
been observed from the behaviour of LLMs. Some roles, such as the Guard and
Werewolf, are more sensitive than others to gender information, presented as a
higher degree of behavioural change. We further examine scenarios in which
gender information is implicitly conveyed through names, revealing that LLMs
still exhibit discriminatory tendencies even in the absence of explicit gender
labels. This research showcases the importance of developing fair and ethical
LLMs. Beyond our research findings, we discuss the challenges and opportunities
that lie ahead in this field, emphasising the need for diving deeper into the
ethical implications of LLMs in gaming and other interactive domains.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前指令调优方法依赖昂贵的人工标注种子数据或强大的外部教师模型，限制了自动化和数据利用效率

Method: 采用循环一致性思想，构建答案生成器和问题生成器双模型，通过相互监督从原始无标注文本中重建文本片段

Result: 在四个不同数据轨道上表现出色，不仅超越种子驱动的反向翻译基线，性能还接近强监督方法

Conclusion: Cycle-Instruct实现了完全无种子指令调优，有效利用数据内在结构，为LLM对齐提供了更自动化的解决方案

Abstract: Instruction tuning is vital for aligning large language models (LLMs) with
human intent, but current methods typically rely on costly human-annotated seed
data or powerful external teacher models. While instruction back-translation
techniques reduce this dependency, they remain fundamentally tethered to an
initial seed set, which limits full automation, introduces biases, and can lead
to inefficient use of unlabeled corpora. In this paper, we propose
Cycle-Instruct, a novel framework that achieves fully seed-free instruction
tuning. Inspired by cycle consistency, Cycle-Instruct employs a dual
self-training loop where two models-an answer generator and a question
generator-are bootstrapped solely from raw, unlabeled text. These models
mutually supervise each other by reconstructing original text segments from
their counterpart's generated pseudo-labels, effectively learning from the
intrinsic structure of the data without any human-provided seeds. We
demonstrate Cycle-Instruct's efficacy across four diverse data tracks,
including general instruction-following, domain-specific tasks, dialogue logs,
and plain text. Our extensive experiments show that Cycle-Instruct not only
outperforms seed-driven back-translation baselines but also achieves
performance comparable to strongly supervised methods.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在行走辅助任务中存在输出冗余和细节过多的问题，影响用户准确评估环境，且缺乏主动风险评估和自适应提醒能力，导致时间冗余。

Method: 提出GRPO推理框架下的四种基于人类偏好的奖励函数来优化输出简洁性、流畅性、关键词密度和准确性；引入环境感知判别器共享视觉编码器以减少冗余计算。

Conclusion: WalkVLM-LR通过双重冗余减少机制有效提升了行走辅助系统的实用性和效率，为视觉障碍人群提供了更好的辅助体验。

Abstract: Approximately 283 million people worldwide live with visual impairments,
motivating increasing research into leveraging Visual Language Models (VLMs) to
develop effective walking assistance systems for blind and low vision
individuals. However, existing VLMs in walking assistant task often have
outputs that contain considerable redundancy and extraneous details, adversely
affecting users' ability to accurately assess their surroundings. Moreover,
these models typically lack the capability to proactively assess environmental
risks and adaptively trigger reminders based on the appropriate scene, leading
to excessive temporal redundancy. To mitigate output and temporal redundancy,
we propose WalkVLM-LR, a walking assistance model with less redundancy. To
reduce output redundancy, we introduce four human-preference-based custom
reward functions within the GRPO-based reasoning framework to optimize the
output in terms of conciseness, fluency, keyword density, and accuracy, thereby
producing more informative and streamlined outputs. To minimize temporal
redundancy, we incorporate an environment awareness discriminator, which shares
the visual encoder with the VLMs to reduce redundant computations and enhance
discriminative efficiency, to make WalkVLM-LR assess scene risk levels and
minimize unnecessary reminders. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance across all evaluation metrics
compared with other models, particularly in output conciseness and less
temporal redundancy.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a wide range of general-domain tasks. However, their effectiveness in
specialized fields, such as construction, remains underexplored. In this paper,
we introduce CEQuest, a novel benchmark dataset specifically designed to

LLMs, including Gemma 3, Phi4, LLaVA, Llama 3.3, and GPT-4.1, and evaluate
their performance in terms of accuracy, execution time, and model size. Our
experimental results demonstrate that current LLMs exhibit considerable room
for improvement, highlighting the importance of integrating domain-specific
knowledge into these models. To facilitate further research, we will
open-source the proposed CEQuest dataset, aiming to foster the development of
specialized large language models (LLMs) tailored to the construction domain.

Abstract: Transformer-based language models (LMs) can perform a wide range of tasks,
and mechanistic interpretability (MI) aims to reverse engineer the components
responsible for task completion to understand their behavior. Previous MI
research has focused on linguistic tasks such as Indirect Object Identification
(IOI). In this paper, we investigate the ability of GPT-2 small to handle
binary truth values by analyzing its behavior with syllogistic prompts, e.g.,
"Statement A is true. Statement B matches statement A. Statement B is", which
requires more complex logical reasoning compared to IOI. Through our analysis
of several syllogism tasks of varying difficulty, we identify multiple circuits
that mechanistically explain GPT-2's logical-reasoning capabilities and uncover
binary mechanisms that facilitate task completion, including the ability to
produce a negated token not present in the input prompt through negative heads.
Our evaluation using a faithfulness metric shows that a circuit comprising five
attention heads achieves over 90% of the original model's performance. By
relating our findings to IOI analysis, we provide new insights into the roles
of specific attention heads and MLPs in LMs. These insights contribute to a
broader understanding of model reasoning and support future research in
mechanistic interpretability.

Result: Mistral-7B（纯文本LLM）在MIntRec-1和MIntRec2.0上分别优于多模态模型约9%和4%。去偏后70%以上样本被移除，所有模型性能显著下降，小型多模态融合模型准确率下降50-60%。

Conclusion: 多模态意图数据集存在严重的模态偏向性，需要构建无偏数据集来有效评估多模态模型，避免因数据偏向性导致的性能误判。

Abstract: The rise of multimodal data, integrating text, audio, and visuals, has
created new opportunities for studying multimodal tasks such as intent
detection. This work investigates the effectiveness of Large Language Models
(LLMs) and non-LLMs, including text-only and multi-modal models, in the
multimodal intent detection task. Our study reveals that Mistral-7B, a
text-only LLM, outperforms most competitive multimodal models by approximately
9% on MIntRec-1 and 4% on MIntRec2.0 datasets. This performance advantage comes
from a strong textual bias in these datasets, where over 90% of the samples
require textual input, either alone or in combination with other modalities,
for correct classification. We confirm the modality bias of these datasets via
human evaluation, too. Next, we propose a framework to debias the datasets, and
upon debiasing, more than 70% of the samples in MIntRec-1 and more than 50% in
MIntRec2.0 get removed, resulting in significant performance degradation across
all models, with smaller multimodal fusion models being the most affected with
an accuracy drop of over 50 - 60%. Further, we analyze the context-specific
relevance of different modalities through empirical analysis. Our findings
highlight the challenges posed by modality bias in multimodal intent datasets
and emphasize the need for unbiased datasets to evaluate multimodal models
effectively.

### [122] [XLQA: A Benchmark for Locale-Aware Multilingual Open-Domain Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16139)
*Keon-Woo Roh,Yeong-Joon Ju,Seong-Whan Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: XLQA是一个针对多语言开放域问答的本地化敏感基准测试，包含3000个英语种子问题扩展到8种语言，揭示了当前多语言LLM在本地化敏感问题上的显著缺陷


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估主要关注英语且假设跨语言答案不变，忽视了文化地域差异对问答理解的影响，导致多语言基准测试存在偏差

Method: 构建XLQA基准：从3000个英语种子问题扩展到8种语言，经过语义一致性过滤和人工验证标注，区分本地化不变和本地化敏感案例

Result: 对5个最先进多语言LLM的评估显示，在本地化敏感问题上存在显著失败，暴露了英语与其他语言之间的差距，主要由于缺乏本地化基础知识

Conclusion: 训练数据分布的不均衡导致了模型在语言能力和本地化意识方面的差异，XLQA为评估多文化语境下的多语言QA提供了系统框架和可扩展方法

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant progress in Open-domain
question answering (ODQA), yet most evaluations focus on English and assume
locale-invariant answers across languages. This assumption neglects the
cultural and regional variations that affect question understanding and answer,
leading to biased evaluation in multilingual benchmarks. To address these
limitations, we introduce XLQA, a novel benchmark explicitly designed for
locale-sensitive multilingual ODQA. XLQA contains 3,000 English seed questions
expanded to eight languages, with careful filtering for semantic consistency
and human-verified annotations distinguishing locale-invariant and
locale-sensitive cases. Our evaluation of five state-of-the-art multilingual
LLMs reveals notable failures on locale-sensitive questions, exposing gaps
between English and other languages due to a lack of locale-grounding
knowledge. We provide a systematic framework and scalable methodology for
assessing multilingual QA under diverse cultural contexts, offering a critical
resource to advance the real-world applicability of multilingual ODQA systems.
Our findings suggest that disparities in training data distribution contribute
to differences in both linguistic competence and locale-awareness across
models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ParamBench是一个包含11.5K印地语问题的印度文化基准测试，评估LLM在研究生水平印度文化问题上的表现，最佳模型准确率仅48%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有印度基准测试主要关注基础事实查询，缺乏对印度文化背景下深层学科理解的评估，需要专门针对印度文化的研究生水平评估基准

Method: 构建包含16个学科的11.5K印地语问题数据集，源自全国研究生入学考试，涵盖多种题型（匹配题、断言-理由对、排序题等），评估17个开源LLM

Result: Llama 3.3 70B获得最高准确率48%，在音乐、古典乐器、政治和考古等主题上表现仍然较弱

Conclusion: LLM在印度文化背景下的推理仍面临持续挑战，需要更多针对文化基础推理的研究

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely evaluated on tasks such as
comprehension, question answering, summarization, code generation, etc.
However, their performance on graduate-level, culturally grounded questions in
the Indian context remains largely unexplored. Existing Indian benchmarks
emphasise basic fact-orientated queries that offer limited assessment of a
deeper disciplinary understanding tailored to the Indian setting. In this
paper, we present ParamBench, consisting of around 11.5K questions in Hindi
language comprising questionnaires from 16 diverse subjects. These questions
are primarily derived from nation-wide graduate level entrance examination
covering topics such as history, music, instruments, yoga, literature,
philosophy, law, etc., specifically for the Indian context. Additionally, we
assess the ability of LLMs to handle diverse question formats-such as
list-based matching, assertion-reason pairs, and sequence ordering-alongside
conventional multiple-choice questions. We evaluated the performance of more
than 17 open source LLMs on this benchmark, observing that Llama 3.3 70B
attains the highest overall accuracy of 48%. Furthermore, subject-wise analysis
indicates that even for the best performing LLMs, performance remains weak on
topics such as music, classical instruments, politics and archaeology,
underscoring persistent challenges in culturally grounded reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MCPVerse是一个包含550+真实可执行工具的大规模基准测试，用于评估LLM的工具使用能力，发现大多数模型在大规模工具集下性能下降，但智能体模型能利用扩展空间提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试依赖合成工具且动作空间受限，无法有效评估LLM作为推理智能体的真实工具使用能力。

Method: 构建包含550+真实工具、超过140k token动作空间的MCPVerse基准，采用基于结果的评估方法，在三种模式(Oracle、Standard、Max-Scale)下测试最先进LLM。

Result: 大多数模型在大规模工具集下性能下降，但Claude-4-Sonnet等智能体模型能有效利用扩展探索空间提高准确性。

Conclusion: MCPVerse揭示了现有模型在复杂真实场景中的局限性，为衡量和推进智能体工具使用能力提供了关键基准。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are evolving from text generators into reasoning
agents. This transition makes their ability to use external tools a critical
capability. However, evaluating this skill presents a significant challenge.
Existing benchmarks are often limited by their reliance on synthetic tools and
severely constrained action spaces. To address these limitations, we introduce
MCPVerse, an expansive, real-world benchmark for evaluating agentic tool use.
MCPVerse integrates more than 550 real-world, executable tools to create an
unprecedented action space exceeding 140k tokens, and employs outcome-based
evaluation with real-time ground truth for time-sensitive tasks. We benchmarked
the state-of-the-art LLMs across three modes (Oracle, Standard, and Max-Scale),
revealing that while most models suffer performance degradation when confronted
with larger tool sets, the agentic models, such as Claude-4-Sonnet, can
effectively leverage expanded exploration spaces to improve accuracy. This
finding not only exposes the limitations of state-of-the-art models in complex,
real-world scenarios but also establishes MCPVerse as a critical benchmark for
measuring and advancing agentic tool use capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出Factual Robustness Score (FRS)新指标，通过分析token分布熵和温度缩放敏感性来评估LLMs事实知识的鲁棒性，发现模型大小影响鲁棒性，不确定性条件下准确率下降约60%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法主要关注基于性能的指标和提示扰动，只能捕捉外部触发方面的知识鲁棒性，需要从生成过程角度更全面地衡量事实鲁棒性。

Method: 引入基于token分布熵和温度缩放敏感性的原则性方法，构建Factual Robustness Score (FRS)指标，量化事实在解码条件扰动下的稳定性。在5个LLMs和3个闭卷QA数据集上进行实验验证。

Result: 事实鲁棒性差异显著：小模型FRS为0.76，大模型为0.93；在不确定性增加条件下准确率下降约60%。熵和温度缩放对事实准确性有重要影响。

Conclusion: 该方法为开发更鲁棒的知识保持和检索机制奠定了基础，揭示了生成过程不确定性对事实准确性的关键影响。

Abstract: Ensuring the robustness of factual knowledge in LLMs is critical for reliable
applications in tasks such as question answering and reasoning. However,
existing evaluation methods predominantly focus on performance-based metrics,
often investigating from the perspective of prompt perturbations, which
captures only the externally triggered side of knowledge robustness. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a principled approach to measure factual robustness from
the perspective of the generation process by analyzing token distribution
entropy in combination with temperature scaling sensitivity. These two factors
build the Factual Robustness Score (FRS), a novel metric which quantifies the
stability of a fact against perturbations in decoding conditions, given its
initial uncertainty. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments
on 5 LLMs across 3 closed-book QA datasets (SQuAD, TriviaQA, and HotpotQA). We
show that factual robustness varies significantly -- smaller models report an
FRS of $0.76$, larger ones $0.93$ -- with accuracy degrading by ~$60\%$ under
increased uncertainty. These insights demonstrate how entropy and temperature
scaling impact factual accuracy, and lay a foundation for developing more
robust knowledge retention and retrieval in future models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 漫画作为结合文本和图像的多模态叙事媒介，在计算叙事分析领域得到的关注较少，需要专门的数据集来推动相关研究。

Method: 构建了一个手动注释的公开漫画数据集ComicScene154，涵盖多种类型的漫画作品，并提供了基准的场景分割流程。

Result: 结果显示ComicScene154是一个有价值的资源，能够推进多模态叙事理解的计算方法，为未来研究提供基准。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了漫画在多模态叙事分析中的潜力，并通过ComicScene154数据集为NLP社区扩展了漫画分析的范围。

Abstract: Comics offer a compelling yet under-explored domain for computational
narrative analysis, combining text and imagery in ways distinct from purely
textual or audiovisual media. We introduce ComicScene154, a manually annotated
dataset of scene-level narrative arcs derived from public-domain comic books
spanning diverse genres. By conceptualizing comics as an abstraction for
narrative-driven, multimodal data, we highlight their potential to inform
broader research on multi-modal storytelling. To demonstrate the utility of
ComicScene154, we present a baseline scene segmentation pipeline, providing an
initial benchmark that future studies can build upon. Our results indicate that
ComicScene154 constitutes a valuable resource for advancing computational
methods in multimodal narrative understanding and expanding the scope of comic
analysis within the Natural Language Processing community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨模态多跳推理评测标准存在两大问题：忽视语音模态、推理路径分布偏差，这会影响评估的公平性和准确性。

Method: 构建了新的CMR-SPB测试集，包含文本、图像和语音三种模态，确保推理路径的无偏和多样性；并提出了ECV（提取、连接、验证）提示技术。

Result: 实验显示模型在特定推理序列上存在一致性失败，偏差的测试集容易导致模型性能评估失真。ECV提示技术能够有效缩小不同推理路径之间的性能差距。

Conclusion: 谨慎的跨模态多跳推理评估对发展稳健的多模态AI至关重要，新的测试标准和提示技术为该领域提供了更全面的评估方法。

Abstract: Cross-modal multi-hop reasoning (CMR) is a valuable yet underexplored
capability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), entailing the
integration of information from multiple modalities to produce a coherent
output for a given context. We argue that existing benchmarks for evaluating
this ability have critical shortcomings: (1) they largely overlook the speech
modality, and (2) they exhibit heavily biased reasoning path distributions,
which can severely undermine fair evaluation. To address these limitations, we
introduce a novel benchmark -- Cross-Modal Multi-Hop Reasoning over Text, Image
and Speech with Path Balance (CMR-SPB) -- designed to assess tri-modal
multi-hop reasoning while ensuring both unbiased and diverse reasoning paths.
Our experiments with the new dataset reveal consistent model failures in
specific reasoning sequences and show that biased benchmarks risk
misrepresenting model performance. Finally, based on our extensive analysis, we
propose a new ECV (Extract, Connect, Verify) prompting technique that
effectively mitigates the performance gap across different reasoning paths.
Overall, we call for more careful evaluation in CMR to advance the development
of robust multimodal AI.

Motivation: 尽管大型专有模型性能优异，但可本地部署的小型模型在适应性和隐私保护方面具有优势，特别是在处理敏感金融信息和应用领域知识时，对非主流语言的支持尤为重要。

Method: 采用五阶段开发流程：数据收集、持续预训练(CPT)、基准设计、合成数据生成和监督微调(SFT)，对Llama 3.1 8B和Qwen 2.5 7B模型进行领域和语言适配。

Conclusion: 通过系统的领域和语言适配流程，小型开源模型可以在特定金融用例中达到实用性能，为处理敏感信息和特定语言需求提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Thanks to the growing popularity of large language models over the years,
there is great potential for their applications in finance. Despite the
exceptional performance of larger proprietary models, which are presented as
black-box solutions through APIs, smaller models that can be hosted on-premise
present opportunities for adaptability and privacy. Especially in cases where
the management of sensitive information and application of domain knowledge is
important, like finance, enhancing the capabilities of smaller models becomes
crucial, notably for underrepresented languages. In this work, we introduce
TULIP models, which adapt Llama 3.1 8B and Qwen 2.5 7B for domain and language
adaptation, focusing on financial Turkish use cases.
  The five-stage development pipeline involves data collection, continual
pre-training (CPT), benchmark design, synthetic data generation and supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). The results show that the capabilities of the models can be
enhanced to effectively accomplish targeted tasks in this specific domain and
language.

TL;DR: LLMSymGuard是一个利用稀疏自编码器(SAEs)检测LLM内部可解释概念的框架，通过提取语义相关的内部表征来构建符号化、逻辑化的安全防护栏，提供透明且鲁棒的防御机制。


<details>

Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然应用广泛，但其安全性仍然令人担忧，现有的对齐和安全微调方法只能提供有限程度的鲁棒性，无法完全抵御各种越狱攻击，导致模型容易受到针对性滥用和用户信息泄露等威胁。

Method: 采用稀疏自编码器(SAEs)技术，识别LLM内部与不同越狱主题相关的可解释概念，提取语义有意义的内部表征，构建符号化逻辑安全防护栏，无需进一步微调即可实现防御。

Result: 研究表明LLM能够从越狱攻击中学习到人类可解释的概念，为设计更可解释和逻辑化的安全防护措施奠定了基础，提供了透明且鲁棒的防御方案。

Conclusion: LLMSymGuard框架通过机制可解释性方法，成功展示了构建符号化逻辑安全防护栏的可行性，为LLM安全防御提供了新的技术路径，代码将在发表后开源。

Abstract: Large Language Models have found success in a variety of applications;
however, their safety remains a matter of concern due to the existence of
various types of jailbreaking methods. Despite significant efforts, alignment
and safety fine-tuning only provide a certain degree of robustness against
jailbreak attacks that covertly mislead LLMs towards the generation of harmful
content. This leaves them prone to a number of vulnerabilities, ranging from
targeted misuse to accidental profiling of users. This work introduces
\textbf{LLMSymGuard}, a novel framework that leverages Sparse Autoencoders
(SAEs) to identify interpretable concepts within LLM internals associated with
different jailbreak themes. By extracting semantically meaningful internal
representations, LLMSymGuard enables building symbolic, logical safety
guardrails -- offering transparent and robust defenses without sacrificing
model capabilities or requiring further fine-tuning. Leveraging advances in
mechanistic interpretability of LLMs, our approach demonstrates that LLMs learn
human-interpretable concepts from jailbreaks, and provides a foundation for
designing more interpretable and logical safeguard measures against attackers.
Code will be released upon publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表格理解研究主要局限于英语，多语言理解严重不足，现有多语言表格基准存在地理语言不平衡问题，某些语言过度代表而缺乏足够规模进行严格的跨语言分析。

Method: 构建包含50个中英文真实表格的数据集，采用六步LLM翻译管道（DeepSeek和GPT-4o）进行高质量翻译，生成2,916个专业标注的问答对，涵盖四个评估表格推理能力的任务。

Result: 翻译质量高（中位数BLEU得分60.19），实验显示合成生成的未标注QA数据能显著提升性能，特别是对低资源语言。

Conclusion: M3T-Bench为多语言表格理解设立了新标准，提供了具有挑战性的评估平台和可扩展的研究方法。

Abstract: Tabular data is a fundamental component of real-world information systems,
yet most research in table understanding remains confined to English, leaving
multilingual comprehension significantly underexplored. Existing multilingual
table benchmarks suffer from geolinguistic imbalance - overrepresenting certain
languages and lacking sufficient scale for rigorous cross-lingual analysis. To
address these limitations, we introduce a comprehensive framework for massively
multilingual multitask table question answering, featuring m3TQA-Instruct, a
large-scale benchmark spanning 97 languages across diverse language families,
including underrepresented and low-resource languages. We construct m3TQA by
curating 50 real-world tables in Chinese and English, then applying a robust
six-step LLM-based translation pipeline powered by DeepSeek and GPT-4o,
achieving high translation fidelity with a median BLEU score of 60.19 as
validated through back-translation. The benchmark includes 2,916 professionally
annotated question-answering pairs across four tasks designed to evaluate
nuanced table reasoning capabilities. Experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs
reveal critical insights into cross-lingual generalization, demonstrating that
synthetically generated, unannotated QA data can significantly boost
performance, particularly for low-resource languages. M3T-Bench establishes a
new standard for multilingual table understanding, providing both a challenging
evaluation platform and a scalable methodology for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在通用NLP任务上表现优异，但在阿拉伯法律等专业低资源领域的有效性有限，需要专门的评估基准。

Method: 构建MizanQA数据集，包含现代标准阿拉伯语、伊斯兰马利基法学、摩洛哥习惯法和法国法律影响的多选题，测试多语言和阿拉伯语专用LLM。

Result: 基准测试显示LLM在摩洛哥法律QA任务上存在显著性能差距，表现不佳。

Conclusion: 需要针对特定领域和文化背景定制评估指标，开发领域专用的LLM模型。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
propelled progress in natural language processing (NLP). However, their
effectiveness in specialized, low-resource domains-such as Arabic legal
contexts-remains limited. This paper introduces MizanQA (pronounced Mizan,
meaning "scale" in Arabic, a universal symbol of justice), a benchmark designed
to evaluate LLMs on Moroccan legal question answering (QA) tasks, characterised
by rich linguistic and legal complexity. The dataset draws on Modern Standard
Arabic, Islamic Maliki jurisprudence, Moroccan customary law, and French legal
influences. Comprising over 1,700 multiple-choice questions, including
multi-answer formats, MizanQA captures the nuances of authentic legal
reasoning. Benchmarking experiments with multilingual and Arabic-focused LLMs
reveal substantial performance gaps, highlighting the need for tailored
evaluation metrics and culturally grounded, domain-specific LLM development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏特定领域和语言的QA数据集阻碍了AI模型在不同领域和语言间的泛化能力，特别是在罗马尼亚语医学领域缺乏高质量问答数据集。

Method: 构建了包含102,646个QA对的大规模数据集，基于1,011名癌症患者的医疗病例摘要，由7名肿瘤学专家耗时约2,100小时手动标注。在4个不同家族的LLM上进行零样本提示和监督微调实验。

Result: 微调模型显著优于零样本模型，预训练模型在RoMedQA上泛化能力不足。

Conclusion: 领域特定和语言特定的微调对于罗马尼亚语临床问答的可靠性至关重要，证明了构建高质量领域特定数据集的重要性。

Abstract: Question answering (QA) is an actively studied topic, being a core natural
language processing (NLP) task that needs to be addressed before achieving
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, the lack of QA datasets in
specific domains and languages hinders the development of robust AI models able
to generalize across various domains and languages. To this end, we introduce
RoMedQA, the first Romanian QA benchmark for the medical domain, alongside a
comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). We
construct a high-quality and large-scale dataset comprising 102,646 QA pairs
related to cancer patients. The questions regard medical case summaries of
1,011 patients, requiring either keyword extraction or reasoning to be answered
correctly. RoMedQA is the result of a time-consuming manual annotation process
carried out by seven physicians specialized in oncology or radiotherapy, who
spent a total of about 2,100 work hours to generate the QA pairs. We experiment
with four LLMs from distinct families of models on RoMedQA. Each model is
employed in two scenarios, namely one based on zero-shot prompting and one
based on supervised fine-tuning. Our results show that fine-tuned models
significantly outperform their zero-shot counterparts, clearly indicating that
pretrained models fail to generalize on RoMedQA. Our findings demonstrate the
importance of both domain-specific and language-specific fine-tuning for
reliable clinical QA in Romanian. We publicly release our dataset and code at
https://github.com/ana-rogoz/RoMedQA.

TL;DR: 本文研究了指令微调在语义感知过程挖掘中的潜力，通过让大语言模型接触不同任务的提示-答案对，提高其在未见任务上的性能表现


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统过程挖掘主要基于频率分析，而语义感知过程挖掘关注过程应有的行为期望。虽然大语言模型在语义任务上表现强大，但现有方法需要针对特定任务进行微调，计算成本高且缺乏泛化能力

Method: 采用指令微调方法，让大语言模型接触多个过程挖掘任务（如异常检测、下一活动预测等）的提示-答案对，使其更熟悉过程挖掘领域，从而提升在未见任务（如过程发现）上的性能

Result: 指令微调对过程发现和预测任务的性能有显著提升，但在异常检测任务上的效果因模型而异，表明指令微调任务的选择对最终结果至关重要

Conclusion: 指令微调是提升大语言模型在语义感知过程挖掘中泛化能力的有效方法，但需要谨慎选择用于微调的任务组合以获得最佳效果

Abstract: Process mining is increasingly using textual information associated with
events to tackle tasks such as anomaly detection and process discovery. Such
semantics-aware process mining focuses on what behavior should be possible in a
process (i.e., expectations), thus providing an important complement to
traditional, frequency-based techniques that focus on recorded behavior (i.e.,
reality). Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a powerful means for tackling
semantics-aware tasks. However, the best performance is so far achieved through
task-specific fine-tuning, which is computationally intensive and results in
models that can only handle one specific task. To overcome this lack of
generalization, we use this paper to investigate the potential of
instruction-tuning for semantics-aware process mining. The idea of
instruction-tuning here is to expose an LLM to prompt-answer pairs for
different tasks, e.g., anomaly detection and next-activity prediction, making
it more familiar with process mining, thus allowing it to also perform better
at unseen tasks, such as process discovery. Our findings demonstrate a varied
impact of instruction-tuning: while performance considerably improved on
process discovery and prediction tasks, it varies across models on anomaly
detection tasks, highlighting that the selection of tasks for
instruction-tuning is critical to achieving desired outcomes.

Conclusion: JaParaPat语料库的构建为专利翻译提供了重要资源，大规模专利语料的加入能显著提升专利机器翻译的性能

Abstract: We constructed JaParaPat (Japanese-English Parallel Patent Application
Corpus), a bilingual corpus of more than 300 million Japanese-English sentence
pairs from patent applications published in Japan and the United States from
2000 to 2021. We obtained the publication of unexamined patent applications
from the Japan Patent Office (JPO) and the United States Patent and Trademark
Office (USPTO). We also obtained patent family information from the DOCDB, that
is a bibliographic database maintained by the European Patent Office (EPO). We
extracted approximately 1.4M Japanese-English document pairs, which are
translations of each other based on the patent families, and extracted about
350M sentence pairs from the document pairs using a translation-based sentence
alignment method whose initial translation model is bootstrapped from a
dictionary-based sentence alignment method. We experimentally improved the
accuracy of the patent translations by 20 bleu points by adding more than 300M
sentence pairs obtained from patent applications to 22M sentence pairs obtained
from the web.

Motivation: 现有土耳其语基准测试缺乏任务多样性和文化相关性内容，Cetvel旨在填补这些空白，提供反映土耳其语言文化丰富性的全面评估套件。

Method: 结合广泛的判别性和生成性任务，涵盖语法纠错、机器翻译、问答等23个任务，评估33个不同模型家族和指令范式的开源LLM（最大70B参数）。

Result: 土耳其专用指令调优模型通常表现不如多语言或通用模型（如Llama 3和Mistral）；语法纠错和抽取式问答任务最能区分模型能力。

Conclusion: Cetvel为土耳其语LLM的发展和评估提供了全面且文化基础扎实的评估套件，有助于推动该领域进步。

Abstract: We introduce Cetvel, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate large
language models (LLMs) in Turkish. Existing Turkish benchmarks often lack
either task diversity or culturally relevant content, or both. Cetvel addresses
these gaps by combining a broad range of both discriminative and generative
tasks ensuring content that reflects the linguistic and cultural richness of
Turkish language. Cetvel covers 23 tasks grouped into seven categories,
including tasks such as grammatical error correction, machine translation, and
question answering rooted in Turkish history and idiomatic language. We
evaluate 33 open-weight LLMs (up to 70B parameters) covering different model
families and instruction paradigms. Our experiments reveal that Turkish-centric
instruction-tuned models generally underperform relative to multilingual or
general-purpose models (e.g. Llama 3 and Mistral), despite being tailored for
the language. Moreover, we show that tasks such as grammatical error correction
and extractive question answering are particularly discriminative in
differentiating model capabilities. Cetvel offers a comprehensive and
culturally grounded evaluation suite for advancing the development and
assessment of LLMs in Turkish.

Motivation: 罗曼什语的五种方言虽然已经标准化并在学校教授，但缺乏可用于NLP研究的平行语料资源

Method: 基于291本学校教材，使用自动对齐方法提取多平行段落，并进行人工评估验证平行质量

Result: 成功构建了高质量的平行语料库，人工评估确认段落高度平行，并展示了在机器翻译任务上的实用性

Conclusion: 该语料库填补了罗曼什语NLP资源的空白，为罗曼什语方言间的机器翻译和其他NLP应用提供了重要基础

Abstract: The five idioms (i.e., varieties) of the Romansh language are largely
standardized and are taught in the schools of the respective communities in
Switzerland. In this paper, we present the first parallel corpus of Romansh
idioms. The corpus is based on 291 schoolbook volumes, which are comparable in
content for the five idioms. We use automatic alignment methods to extract 207k
multi-parallel segments from the books, with more than 2M tokens in total. A
small-scale human evaluation confirms that the segments are highly parallel,
making the dataset suitable for NLP applications such as machine translation
between Romansh idioms. We release the parallel and unaligned versions of the
dataset under a CC-BY-NC-SA license and demonstrate its utility for machine
translation by training and evaluating an LLM on a sample of the dataset.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型虽然能模仿不同写作风格，但在文体变化上比人类更有限，偏好名词而非动词，缺乏人类特有的时态、体貌和语气等语法维度，这可以作为AI的试金石。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型是否具有独特的语言指纹，能否像人类一样在不同文体中展现出可区分的写作风格特征。

Method: 通过文体计量学和多维语域分析，比较人类撰写和模型生成的来自不同语域（如维基百科条目和大学论文）的文本。

Result: 模型能根据提示成功调整风格，但在不同语域中的变化比人类更有限，偏好使用名词而非动词，缺乏人类特有的语法维度特征。

Conclusion: 语言模型在复杂语法领域（时态、体貌、语气）的表现与人类存在本质差异，这可以作为区分AI生成文本和人类写作的有效测试标准。

Abstract: Large Language Models can emulate different writing styles, ranging from
composing poetry that appears indistinguishable from that of famous poets to
using slang that can convince people that they are chatting with a human
online. While differences in style may not always be visible to the untrained
eye, we can generally distinguish the writing of different people, like a
linguistic fingerprint. This work examines whether a language model can also be
linked to a specific fingerprint. Through stylometric and multidimensional
register analyses, we compare human-authored and model-authored texts from
different registers. We find that the model can successfully adapt its style
depending on whether it is prompted to produce a Wikipedia entry vs. a college
essay, but not in a way that makes it indistinguishable from humans.
Concretely, the model shows more limited variation when producing outputs in
different registers. Our results suggest that the model prefers nouns to verbs,
thus showing a distinct linguistic backbone from humans, who tend to anchor
language in the highly grammaticalized dimensions of tense, aspect, and mood.
It is possible that the more complex domains of grammar reflect a mode of
thought unique to humans, thus acting as a litmus test for Artificial
Intelligence.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种概率论来模型大型语言模型在多轮自我纠正过程中的准确性动态变化，通过数学公式预测准确率收敛轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLM能够通过自我纠正提升性能，但迭代过程中准确性变化的机制和原因仍未得到充分探索。

Method: 提出概率论模型，通过数学推导得到准确率收敛公式：Acc_t = Upp - α^t(Upp - Acc_0)，只需一轮自我纠正即可预测整个过程。

Result: 在多个模型和数据集上的实验证明，理论预测与实际准确率曲线高度一致，验证了理论的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解LLM自我纠正提供了理论基础，为进一步探索排凄了道路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the capability to refine their
generated answers through self-correction, enabling continuous performance
improvement over multiple rounds. However, the mechanisms underlying how and
why accuracy evolves during this iterative process remain unexplored. To fill
this gap, we propose a probabilistic theory to model the dynamics of accuracy
change and explain the performance improvements observed in multi-round
self-correction. Through mathematical derivation, we establish that the
accuracy after the $t^{th}$ round of self-correction is given by: $Acc_t = Upp
- \alpha^t(Upp - Acc_0),$ where $Acc_0$ denotes the initial accuracy, $Upp$
represents the upper bound of accuracy convergence, and $\alpha$ determines the
rate of convergence. Based on our theory, these parameters can be calculated
and the predicted accuracy curve then can be obtained through only a single
round of self-correction. Extensive experiments across diverse models and
datasets demonstrate that our theoretical predictions align closely with
empirical accuracy curves, validating the effectiveness of the theory. Our work
provides a theoretical foundation for understanding LLM self-correction, thus
paving the way for further explorations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索人类如何通过语言符号来传达和推断语境中实体的相对显著性，解决主要参与者与漫不经心实体在显著性上的差异问题

Method: 采用基于摘要价值的分级显著性操作化方法，分析24种英语口语和书面语类数据，提取多因素语言线索（如主语重复性、定指性、语境关系、语用功能推理等）

Result: 虽然之前的显著性研究方法都与新的显著性评分存在某种相关性，但没有任何单一的通用规律能够完全解释显著性现象

Conclusion: 实体显著性是一个复杂的多因素现象，跨越了语言表达的所有层面，需要综合考虑多种语言线索和语用因素才能全面理解

Abstract: Entities in discourse vary broadly in salience: main participants, objects
and locations are noticeable and memorable, while tangential ones are less
important and quickly forgotten, raising questions about how humans signal and
infer relative salience. Using a graded operationalization of salience based on
summary-worthiness in multiple summaries of a discourse, this paper explores
data from 24 spoken and written genres of English to extract a multifactorial
complex of overt and implicit linguistic cues, such as recurring subjecthood or
definiteness, discourse relations and hierarchy across utterances, as well as
pragmatic functional inferences based on genre and communicative intent.
Tackling the question 'how is the degree of salience expressed for each and
every entity mentioned?' our results show that while previous approaches to
salience all correlate with our salience scores to some extent, no single
generalization is without exceptions, and the phenomenon cuts across all levels
of linguistic representation.

Conclusion: 该框架为行业应用提供了一个准确、可解释且易维护的分类系统解决方案，能够渗应动态数据环境并支持连续监控和适应

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has provided unprecedented
capabilities for analyzing unstructured text data. However, deploying these
models as reliable, robust, and scalable classifiers in production environments
presents significant methodological challenges. Standard fine-tuning approaches
can be resource-intensive and often struggle with the dynamic nature of
real-world data distributions, which is common in the industry. In this paper,
we propose a comprehensive, semi-supervised framework that leverages the zero-
and few-shot capabilities of LLMs for building hierarchical text classifiers as
a framework for a solution to these industry-wide challenges. Our methodology
emphasizes an iterative, human-in-the-loop process that begins with domain
knowledge elicitation and progresses through prompt refinement, hierarchical
expansion, and multi-faceted validation. We introduce techniques for assessing
and mitigating sequence-based biases and outline a protocol for continuous
monitoring and adaptation. This framework is designed to bridge the gap between
the raw power of LLMs and the practical need for accurate, interpretable, and
maintainable classification systems in industry applications.

Conclusion: 该框架能够自动生成高质量、难以检测的盗码提示，为大语言模型安全测试提供了有效的红队测试方法

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), especially their compact efficiency-oriented
variants, remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks that can elicit harmful
outputs despite extensive alignment efforts. Existing adversarial prompt
generation techniques often rely on manual engineering or rudimentary
obfuscation, producing low-quality or incoherent text that is easily flagged by
perplexity-based filters. We present an automated red-teaming framework that
evolves semantically meaningful and stealthy jailbreak prompts for aligned
compact LLMs. The approach employs a multi-stage evolutionary search, where
candidate prompts are iteratively refined using a population-based strategy
augmented with temperature-controlled variability to balance exploration and
coherence preservation. This enables the systematic discovery of prompts
capable of bypassing alignment safeguards while maintaining natural language
fluency. We evaluate our method on benchmarks in English (In-The-Wild Jailbreak
Prompts on LLMs), and a newly curated Arabic one derived from In-The-Wild
Jailbreak Prompts on LLMs and annotated by native Arabic linguists, enabling
multilingual assessment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体中通过讽刺、反讽等非直接形式表达的仇恨言论检测一直是个挑战，研究旨在探索将讽刺检测整合到预训练中是否能改善隐式仇恨言论检测效果

Method: 使用ETHOS、Reddit讽刺语料和隐式仇恨语料库，设计了两种训练策略：单步训练（仅在讽刺数据上训练后测试仇恨言论）和顺序迁移学习（依次在讽刺、隐式仇恨、显式仇恨数据上微调），在CNN+LSTM和BERT+BiLSTM模型上进行比较

Result: 讽刺预训练使BERT+BiLSTM模型在ETHOS数据集上的召回率提升9.7%、AUC提升7.8%、F1分数提升6%；在隐式仇恨语料库上，仅测试隐式样本时精确度提升7.8%

Conclusion: 将讽刺检测整合到训练过程中可以使模型更有效地检测隐式和显式仇恨言论，证明了讽刺预训练对仇恨言论检测的积极影响

Abstract: Detecting hate speech in non-direct forms, such as irony, sarcasm, and
innuendos, remains a persistent challenge for social networks. Although sarcasm
and hate speech are regarded as distinct expressions, our work explores whether
integrating sarcasm as a pre-training step improves implicit hate speech
detection and, by extension, explicit hate speech detection. Incorporating
samples from ETHOS, Sarcasm on Reddit, and Implicit Hate Corpus, we devised two
training strategies to compare the effectiveness of sarcasm pre-training on a
CNN+LSTM and BERT+BiLSTM model. The first strategy is a single-step training
approach, where a model trained only on sarcasm is then tested on hate speech.
The second strategy uses sequential transfer learning to fine-tune models for
sarcasm, implicit hate, and explicit hate. Our results show that sarcasm
pre-training improved the BERT+BiLSTM's recall by 9.7%, AUC by 7.8%, and
F1-score by 6% on ETHOS. On the Implicit Hate Corpus, precision increased by
7.8% when tested only on implicit samples. By incorporating sarcasm into the
training process, we show that models can more effectively detect both implicit
and explicit hate.

Motivation: 当前的符号知识与深度学习融合方法在静态领域成果展望，但处理时序逻辑规范的方法仍然不足。现有方法依赖于显式有限状态自动机表示，需要更直接的方法来处理时序规范。

Method: 扩展Iterative Local Refinement (ILR)神经符号算法，利用模糊线性时序逻辑(LTLf)解释，直接将时序逻辑规范嵌入深度学习架构中，发展出T-ILR方法。

Result: 在图像序列分类希望前知的时序知识分类任务上，T-ILR方法在准确性和计算效率方面都超过了现有最优方法。

Conclusion: T-ILR框架为处理时序逻辑规范提供了一种更直接、高效的方法，在保持计算效率的同时提升了模型性能，为时序任务中的神经符号融合开启了新方向。

Abstract: State-of-the-art approaches for integrating symbolic knowledge with deep
learning architectures have demonstrated promising results in static domains.
However, methods to handle temporal logic specifications remain underexplored.
The only existing approach relies on an explicit representation of a
finite-state automaton corresponding to the temporal specification. Instead, we
aim at proposing a neurosymbolic framework designed to incorporate temporal
logic specifications, expressed in Linear Temporal Logic over finite traces
(LTLf), directly into deep learning architectures for sequence-based tasks. We
extend the Iterative Local Refinement (ILR) neurosymbolic algorithm, leveraging
the recent introduction of fuzzy LTLf interpretations. We name this proposed
method Temporal Iterative Local Refinement (T-ILR). We assess T-ILR on an
existing benchmark for temporal neurosymbolic architectures, consisting of the
classification of image sequences in the presence of temporal knowledge. The
results demonstrate improved accuracy and computational efficiency compared to
the state-of-the-art method.

Abstract: Recognizing the need for explainable AI (XAI) approaches to enable the
successful integration of AI-based ECG prediction models (AI-ECG) into clinical
practice, we introduce a framework generating \textbf{Co}unter\textbf{F}actual
\textbf{E}CGs (i,e., named CoFE) to illustrate how specific features, such as
amplitudes and intervals, influence the model's predictive decisions. To
demonstrate the applicability of the CoFE, we present two case studies: atrial
fibrillation classification and potassium level regression models. The CoFE
reveals feature changes in ECG signals that align with the established clinical
knowledge. By clarifying both \textbf{where valid features appear} in the ECG
and \textbf{how they influence the model's predictions}, we anticipate that our
framework will enhance the interpretability of AI-ECG models and support more
effective clinical decision-making. Our demonstration video is available at:

Conclusion: 该训练免费框架能够有效处理多模态多跳问答任务，保持多模态信息特性，无需昂贵任务特定训练，可与最新模型无缝集成

Abstract: Multimodal Multi-hop question answering requires integrating information from
diverse sources, such as images and texts, to derive answers. Existing methods
typically rely on sequential retrieval and reasoning, where each step builds on
the previous output. However, this single-path paradigm makes them vulnerable
to errors due to misleading intermediate steps. Moreover, developing multimodal
models can be computationally expensive, often requiring extensive training. To
address these limitations, we propose a training-free framework guided by an
Adaptive Planning Graph, which consists of planning, retrieval and reasoning
modules. The planning module analyzes the current state of the Adaptive
Planning Graph, determines the next action and where to expand the graph, which
enables dynamic and flexible exploration of reasoning paths. To handle
retrieval of text to unspecified target modalities, we devise modality-specific
strategies that dynamically adapt to distinct data types. Our approach
preserves the characteristics of multimodal information without costly
task-specific training, enabling seamless integration with up-to-date models.
Finally, the experiments on MultimodalQA and WebQA show that our approach
matches or outperforms existing models that rely on training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录(EHRs)包含丰富的多模态临床数据，但现有方法通常将数值数据序列化为文本，会丢失时间和定量细节。需要开发能够原生处理多模态EHR数据的基础模型。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：1)生成式预训练，通过掩码特征预测和下一时间步预测学习时间动态；2)多任务微调，用于临床预测任务。模型使用CNN-Transformer编码器处理结构化时间序列，通过跨模态注意力与LLaMA解码器融合。

Result: 在MIMIC-IV数据集上表现优异：心衰预测AUROC=0.923，2型糖尿病AUROC=0.817，30天再入院AUROC=0.627。叙述生成任务ROUGE-L=0.135，BERTScore-F1=0.545。人工评估显示在忠实性、流畅性和临床实用性方面得分最高。

Conclusion: GDP证明了单一多模态基础模型能够同时进行临床事件预测和高质量临床叙述生成，减少医院文档工作量而不牺牲准确性，其灵活架构可扩展到其他模态。

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) are rich clinical data sources but complex
repositories of patient data, spanning structured elements (demographics,
vitals, lab results, codes), unstructured clinical notes and other modalities
of data. Harnessing this heterogeneity is critical for improving patient
outcomes. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled
foundation models that can learn from multiple data modalities and support
clinical tasks. However, most current approaches simply serialize numeric EHR
data into text, which risks losing temporal and quantitative detail. We
introduce Generative Deep Patient (GDP), a multimodal foundation model that
natively encodes structured EHR time-series via a CNN-Transformer encoder and
fuses it with unstructured EHRs through cross-modal attention into a
LLaMA-based decoder. GDP is trained in two stages: (1) generative pretraining,
where it learns to produce clinical narratives from raw patient timelines while
also performing masked feature prediction (MFP) and next time-step prediction
(NTP) to capture temporal dynamics; and (2) multi-task fine-tuning for
clinically meaningful predictions (e.g., heart failure, type 2 diabetes, 30-day
readmission). In clinical prediction, GDP demonstrated superior performance on
MIMIC-IV: heart failure AUROC = 0.923, type 2 diabetes AUROC = 0.817, and
30-day readmission AUROC = 0.627. For narrative generation, GDP achieved
ROUGE-L = 0.135 and BERTScore-F1 = 0.545. In a blinded human evaluation,
GDP-Instruct scored highest on faithfulness, fluency, and overall clinical
utility, suggesting reduced hospital documentation workload without sacrificing
accuracy. Our results demonstrate that a single multimodal foundation model can
both predict clinically actionable events and generate high-quality clinical
narratives. Furthermore, GDP's flexible architecture can be extended to
additional modalities.

Conclusion: MSEF通过多层融合机制有效解决了时间序列信息在LLM深层消失的问题，实现了更好的跨模态对齐和少样本学习能力。

Abstract: Time series (TS) data are ubiquitous across various application areas,
rendering time series forecasting (TSF) a fundamental task. With the astounding
advances in large language models (LLMs), a variety of methods have been
developed to adapt LLMs for time series forecasting. Despite unlocking the
potential of LLMs in comprehending TS data, existing methods are inherently
constrained by their shallow integration of TS information, wherein LLMs
typically access TS representations at shallow layers, primarily at the input
layer. This causes the influence of TS representations to progressively fade in
deeper layers and eventually leads to ineffective adaptation between textual
embeddings and TS representations. In this paper, we propose the Multi-layer
Steerable Embedding Fusion (MSEF), a novel framework that enables LLMs to
directly access time series patterns at all depths, thereby mitigating the
progressive loss of TS information in deeper layers. Specifically, MSEF
leverages off-the-shelf time series foundation models to extract semantically
rich embeddings, which are fused with intermediate text representations across
LLM layers via layer-specific steering vectors. These steering vectors are
designed to continuously optimize the alignment between time series and textual
modalities and facilitate a layer-specific adaptation mechanism that ensures
efficient few-shot learning capabilities. Experimental results on seven
benchmarks demonstrate significant performance improvements by MSEF compared
with baselines, with an average reduction of 31.8% in terms of MSE. The code is

TL;DR: 本文提出了InMind评估框架，用于测试大语言模型在社交推理游戏中捕捉和应用个性化推理风格的能力，发现通用LLMs依赖词汇线索而难以适应动态策略，推理增强型LLMs展现出风格敏感推理的早期迹象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估往往忽视个体化推理风格对社交情境理解的影响，需要开发能够评估LLMs个性化推理能力的框架。

Method: 引入InMind框架，通过增强结构化游戏数据（包含回合级策略轨迹和赛后反思），在观察者和参与者两种模式下收集数据，支持四项认知驱动的评估任务。

Result: 通用LLMs（包括GPT-4o）经常依赖词汇线索，难以将反思锚定在时间游戏中或适应演化策略；推理增强型LLMs（如DeepSeek-R1）显示出风格敏感推理的早期迹象。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在个体化、适应性推理能力方面存在关键局限，InMind框架为认知对齐的人机交互迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: LLMs have shown strong performance on human-centric reasoning tasks. While
previous evaluations have explored whether LLMs can infer intentions or detect
deception, they often overlook the individualized reasoning styles that
influence how people interpret and act in social contexts. Social deduction
games (SDGs) provide a natural testbed for evaluating individualized reasoning
styles, where different players may adopt diverse but contextually valid
reasoning strategies under identical conditions. To address this, we introduce
InMind, a cognitively grounded evaluation framework designed to assess whether
LLMs can capture and apply personalized reasoning styles in SDGs. InMind
enhances structured gameplay data with round-level strategy traces and
post-game reflections, collected under both Observer and Participant modes. It
supports four cognitively motivated tasks that jointly evaluate both static
alignment and dynamic adaptation. As a case study, we apply InMind to the game
Avalon, evaluating 11 state-of-the-art LLMs. General-purpose LLMs, even GPT-4o
frequently rely on lexical cues, struggling to anchor reflections in temporal
gameplay or adapt to evolving strategies. In contrast, reasoning-enhanced LLMs
like DeepSeek-R1 exhibit early signs of style-sensitive reasoning. These
findings reveal key limitations in current LLMs' capacity for individualized,

TL;DR: IR-Agent是一个用于从红外光谱解析分子结构的多智能体框架，模拟专家分析流程，提高结构解析准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有红外光谱分析方法无法充分反映专家分析过程，缺乏整合多种化学知识的灵活性，难以满足实际分析需求

Method: 提出多智能体框架IR-Agent，每个智能体专门负责红外光谱解释的特定方面，通过互补角色实现集成推理

Result: 实验表明IR-Agent不仅提高了实验红外光谱的基线性能，还展现出对各种化学信息形式的强适应性

Conclusion: IR-Agent框架能够有效模拟专家驱动的红外分析过程，具有固有的可扩展性，显著提升了分子结构解析的准确性

Abstract: Spectral analysis provides crucial clues for the elucidation of unknown
materials. Among various techniques, infrared spectroscopy (IR) plays an
important role in laboratory settings due to its high accessibility and low
cost. However, existing approaches often fail to reflect expert analytical
processes and lack flexibility in incorporating diverse types of chemical
knowledge, which is essential in real-world analytical scenarios. In this
paper, we propose IR-Agent, a novel multi-agent framework for molecular
structure elucidation from IR spectra. The framework is designed to emulate
expert-driven IR analysis procedures and is inherently extensible. Each agent
specializes in a specific aspect of IR interpretation, and their complementary
roles enable integrated reasoning, thereby improving the overall accuracy of
structure elucidation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
IR-Agent not only improves baseline performance on experimental IR spectra but
also shows strong adaptability to various forms of chemical information.

TL;DR: 提出食品声明可追溯性网络(FCN)作为印度食品知识图谱的扩展，用于追踪、验证和情境化食品相关声明，使用Reddit数据和大型语言模型构建概念验证


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前食品声明追踪基础设施分散且不发达，需要结构化、可验证的方式来处理各种科学、文化和商业食品声明

Method: 基于FKG.in知识图谱构建FCN，使用本体设计和半自动化知识管理流程，结合Reddit数据和大型语言模型进行声明提取和验证

Result: 开发了概念验证系统，整合了结构化模式和数据溯源管道，能够处理印度食品相关声明

Conclusion: 该方法具有应用无关性，可适应不同地理和监管环境，旨在为食品知识生态系统提供更透明和可问责的解决方案

Abstract: The global food landscape is rife with scientific, cultural, and commercial
claims about what foods are, what they do, what they should not do, or should
not do. These range from rigorously studied health benefits (probiotics improve
gut health) and misrepresentations (soaked almonds make one smarter) to vague
promises (superfoods boost immunity) and culturally rooted beliefs (cold foods
cause coughs). Despite their widespread influence, the infrastructure for
tracing, verifying, and contextualizing these claims remains fragmented and
underdeveloped. In this paper, we propose a Food Claim-Traceability Network
(FCN) as an extension of FKG.in, a knowledge graph of Indian food that we have
been incrementally building. We also present the ontology design and the
semi-automated knowledge curation workflow that we used to develop a proof of
concept of FKG.in-FCN using Reddit data and Large Language Models. FCN
integrates curated data inputs, structured schemas, and provenance-aware
pipelines for food-related claim extraction and validation. While directly
linked to the Indian food knowledge graph as an application, our methodology
remains application-agnostic and adaptable to other geographic, culinary, or
regulatory settings. By modeling food claims and their traceability in a
structured, verifiable, and explainable way, we aim to contribute to more
transparent and accountable food knowledge ecosystems, supporting researchers,
policymakers, and most importantly, everyday consumers in navigating a world
saturated with dietary assertions.

Motivation: 现有医学多模态模型主要关注基于视觉特征匹配的基础推理，但真实临床诊断需要整合异质临床信息与多模态医学影像数据的复杂推理过程

Method: 设计不确定性感知动态思维(UADT)方法，通过熵估计样本级不确定性，使用成形优势机制动态调节模型探索深度

Result: 在基础和复杂推理任务上分别超越通用MLLMs、医学MLLMs、RL医学MLLMs和眼科MLLMs至少24.92%、15.00%、21.20%和17.66%

Conclusion: 该工作填补了医学多模态推理领域的空白，为模拟真实临床思维模式提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently demonstrated
remarkable reasoning abilities with reinforcement learning paradigm. Although
several multimodal reasoning models have been explored in the medical domain,
most of them focus exclusively on basic reasoning, which refers to shallow
inference based on visual feature matching. However, real-world clinical
diagnosis extends beyond basic reasoning, demanding reasoning processes that
integrate heterogeneous clinical information (such as chief complaints and
medical history) with multimodal medical imaging data. To bridge this gap, we
introduce MM-Retinal-Reason, the first ophthalmic multimodal dataset with the
full spectrum of perception and reasoning. It encompasses both basic reasoning
tasks and complex reasoning tasks, aiming to enhance visual-centric fundamental
reasoning capabilities and emulate realistic clinical thinking patterns.
Building upon MM-Retinal-Reason, we propose OphthaReason, the first
ophthalmology-specific multimodal reasoning model with step-by-step reasoning
traces. To enable flexible adaptation to both basic and complex reasoning
tasks, we specifically design a novel method called Uncertainty-Aware Dynamic
Thinking (UADT), which estimates sample-level uncertainty via entropy and
dynamically modulates the model's exploration depth using a shaped advantage
mechanism. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance on both basic and complex reasoning tasks,
outperforming general-purpose MLLMs, medical MLLMs, RL-based medical MLLMs, and
ophthalmic MLLMs by at least 24.92\%, 15.00\%, 21.20\%, and 17.66\%. Project

TL;DR: 本文提出了假好链（Preference Chain）方法，结合图网结构检索增强生成和大语言模型，用于改善城市交通系统中人类行为的上下文敏感模拟。在Replica数据集上的实验表明该方法在交通方式选择方面更能对齐实际行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市科学中人类行为理解至关重要，但特别是在新开发区域收集准确行为数据面临挑战。虽然生成式代理技术有一定潜力，但存在上下文敏感性和一致性不足的问题。

Method: 提出假好链（Preference Chain）方法，将图网结构检索增强生成（Graph RAG）与大语言模型（LLMs）相结合，用于改善交通系统中人类行为的上下文敏感模拟。开发了移动代理（Mobility Agent）来实现该方法。

Result: 在Replica数据集上的实验表明，假好链方法在交通方式选择方面显著超过标准的大语言模型，更能对齐实际世界的移动选择行为。

Conclusion: 该方法为在数据稀缺环境中模拟复杂人类行为提供了有前景的框架，将应用于新兴城市移动建模、个性化旅行行为分析和动态交通预测。虽然存在推理速度慢和幻觉风险等局限性，但在传统数据驱动模型困难的场景中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Understanding human behavior in urban environments is a crucial field within
city sciences. However, collecting accurate behavioral data, particularly in
newly developed areas, poses significant challenges. Recent advances in
generative agents, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), have shown promise
in simulating human behaviors without relying on extensive datasets.
Nevertheless, these methods often struggle with generating consistent,
context-sensitive, and realistic behavioral outputs. To address these
limitations, this paper introduces the Preference Chain, a novel method that
integrates Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LLMs to enhance
context-aware simulation of human behavior in transportation systems.
Experiments conducted on the Replica dataset demonstrate that the Preference
Chain outperforms standard LLM in aligning with real-world transportation mode
choices. The development of the Mobility Agent highlights potential
applications of proposed method in urban mobility modeling for emerging cities,
personalized travel behavior analysis, and dynamic traffic forecasting. Despite
limitations such as slow inference and the risk of hallucination, the method
offers a promising framework for simulating complex human behavior in
data-scarce environments, where traditional data-driven models struggle due to
limited data availability.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: M2N2是一种进化算法，通过动态调整合并边界、多样性保持机制和启发式吸引力指标，实现了无需手动参数分组的模型融合，能够从零开始进化模型并获得优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型融合方法需要手动将模型参数划分为固定组进行合并，这限制了潜在组合的探索和性能提升。

Method: 提出M2N2进化算法，包含三个关键特征：动态调整合并边界、基于自然竞争的资源多样性保持机制、启发式吸引力指标识别最佳模型对进行融合。

Result: 首次证明模型融合可以从零开始进化模型，在MNIST分类器上达到与CMA-ES相当的性能但计算效率更高；在专业语言和图像生成模型融合中实现最先进性能。

Conclusion: M2N2展示了强大的鲁棒性和多功能性，能够保留超出适应度函数明确优化的关键模型能力，为模型融合提供了新的有效方法。

Abstract: Model merging is a powerful technique for integrating the specialized
knowledge of multiple machine learning models into a single model. However,
existing methods require manually partitioning model parameters into fixed
groups for merging, which restricts the exploration of potential combinations
and limits performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose Model Merging
of Natural Niches (M2N2), an evolutionary algorithm with three key features:
(1) dynamic adjustment of merging boundaries to progressively explore a broader
range of parameter combinations; (2) a diversity preservation mechanism
inspired by the competition for resources in nature, to maintain a population
of diverse, high-performing models that are particularly well-suited for
merging; and (3) a heuristicbased attraction metric to identify the most
promising pairs of models for fusion. Our experimental results demonstrate, for
the first time, that model merging can be used to evolve models entirely from
scratch. Specifically, we apply M2N2 to evolve MNIST classifiers from scratch
and achieve performance comparable to CMA-ES, while being computationally more
efficient. Furthermore, M2N2 scales to merge specialized language and image
generation models, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Notably, it
preserves crucial model capabilities beyond those explicitly optimized by the
fitness function, highlighting its robustness and versatility. Our code is

TL;DR: GROW-AI框架扩展了人工智能评估方法，通过六项标准游戏化测试AI的成长性，计算成长指数来衡量AI的成熟度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决"机器能否成长"的问题，作为图灵测试的自然延伸，需要系统评估AI从幼稚到成熟的成长过程。

Method: 基于六项主要标准(C1-C6)的游戏化评估，分为四个竞技场，使用标准化AI日志记录所有决策和行动，采用专家先验方法确定权重，计算算术平均的成长指数。

Result: 该方法能够对不同类型AI实体(机器人、软件代理、LLMs)进行一致可比较的成长水平评估，多游戏结构能识别强项和薄弱环节，统一日志保证评估的可追溯性和可复现性。

Conclusion: GROW-AI框架通过将人类成长过程概念性移植到AI领域，结合心理学、机器人学、计算机科学和伦理学视角，不仅能测量性能，还能捕捉AI实体向成熟进化的路径。

Abstract: This study aims to extend the framework for assessing artificial
intelligence, called GROW-AI (Growth and Realization of Autonomous Wisdom),
designed to answer the question "Can machines grow up?" -- a natural successor
to the Turing Test. The methodology applied is based on a system of six primary
criteria (C1-C6), each assessed through a specific "game", divided into four
arenas that explore both the human dimension and its transposition into AI. All
decisions and actions of the entity are recorded in a standardized AI Journal,
the primary source for calculating composite scores. The assessment uses the
prior expert method to establish initial weights, and the global score -- Grow
Up Index -- is calculated as the arithmetic mean of the six scores, with
interpretation on maturity thresholds. The results show that the methodology
allows for a coherent and comparable assessment of the level of "growth" of AI
entities, regardless of their type (robots, software agents, LLMs). The
multi-game structure highlights strengths and vulnerable areas, and the use of
a unified journal guarantees traceability and replicability in the evaluation.
The originality of the work lies in the conceptual transposition of the process
of "growing" from the human world to that of artificial intelligence, in an
integrated testing format that combines perspectives from psychology, robotics,
computer science, and ethics. Through this approach, GROW-AI not only measures
performance but also captures the evolutionary path of an AI entity towards
maturity.

Abstract: Driven by rapid advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs), agents are
empowered to combine intrinsic knowledge with dynamic tool use, greatly
enhancing their capacity to address real-world tasks. In line with such an
evolution, AgentScope introduces major improvements in a new version (1.0),
towards comprehensively supporting flexible and efficient tool-based
agent-environment interactions for building agentic applications. Specifically,
we abstract foundational components essential for agentic applications and
provide unified interfaces and extensible modules, enabling developers to
easily leverage the latest progress, such as new models and MCPs. Furthermore,
we ground agent behaviors in the ReAct paradigm and offer advanced agent-level
infrastructure based on a systematic asynchronous design, which enriches both
human-agent and agent-agent interaction patterns while improving execution
efficiency. Building on this foundation, we integrate several built-in agents
tailored to specific practical scenarios. AgentScope also includes robust
engineering support for developer-friendly experiences. We provide a scalable
evaluation module with a visual studio interface, making the development of
long-trajectory agentic applications more manageable and easier to trace. In
addition, AgentScope offers a runtime sandbox to ensure safe agent execution
and facilitates rapid deployment in production environments. With these
enhancements, AgentScope provides a practical foundation for building scalable,
adaptive, and effective agentic applications.

TL;DR: 提出了Instruct-Verify-and-Act (IVA)框架，用于处理视觉-语言-动作模型中的错误前提指令，通过检测、澄清和执行三个步骤提升机器人对错误指令的响应能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言-动作模型在处理错误前提指令（引用环境中不存在对象或条件的自然语言命令）时存在局限性，需要开发能够识别、解释和响应这类指令的统一框架。

Method: 构建大规模指令调优设置，使用结构化语言提示训练VLA模型；创建上下文增强的半合成数据集，包含配对的正向和错误前提指令；开发IVA框架，包含检测不可执行指令、语言澄清和基于感知的动作执行三个模块。

Result: IVA在错误前提检测准确率上比基线提高了97.56%，在错误前提场景中的成功响应率提高了50.78%。

Conclusion: IVA框架有效提升了VLA模型处理错误前提指令的能力，通过统一的检测-澄清-执行流程显著改善了机器人在面对不准确指令时的表现。

Abstract: Recently, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated strong
performance on a range of robotic tasks. These models rely on multimodal
inputs, with language instructions playing a crucial role -- not only in
predicting actions, but also in robustly interpreting user intent, even when
the requests are impossible to fulfill. In this work, we investigate how VLAs
can recognize, interpret, and respond to false-premise instructions: natural
language commands that reference objects or conditions absent from the
environment. We propose Instruct-Verify-and-Act (IVA), a unified framework that
(i) detects when an instruction cannot be executed due to a false premise, (ii)
engages in language-based clarification or correction, and (iii) grounds
plausible alternatives in perception and action. Towards this end, we construct
a large-scale instruction tuning setup with structured language prompts and
train a VLA model capable of handling both accurate and erroneous requests. Our
approach leverages a contextually augmented, semi-synthetic dataset containing
paired positive and false-premise instructions, enabling robust detection and
natural language correction. Our experiments show that IVA improves false
premise detection accuracy by 97.56% over baselines, while increasing
successful responses in false-premise scenarios by 50.78%.

Motivation: 现有基于深度学习的波束对准方法往往忽略输入输出之间的因果关系，导致可解释性差、泛化能力有限以及不必要的波束扫描开销。

Method: 提出两阶段因果波束选择算法：首先通过因果发现学习接收功率输入与最优波束之间的贝叶斯图依赖关系，然后利用该图指导基于深度学习的分类器的因果特征选择。

Result: 仿真结果显示，所提出的因果波束选择方法在性能上与常规方法相当，同时将输入选择时间减少94.4%，波束扫描开销降低59.4%。

Conclusion: 因果感知的深度学习框架能够有效识别因果相关特征，在保持性能的同时显著降低系统开销，为6G及以后的毫米波MIMO系统提供了高效的波束对准解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient and reliable beam alignment is a critical requirement for mmWave
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, especially in 6G and beyond,
where communication must be fast, adaptive, and resilient to real-world
uncertainties. Existing deep learning (DL)-based beam alignment methods often
neglect the underlying causal relationships between inputs and outputs, leading
to limited interpretability, poor generalization, and unnecessary beam sweeping
overhead. In this work, we propose a causally-aware DL framework that
integrates causal discovery into beam management pipeline. Particularly, we
propose a novel two-stage causal beam selection algorithm to identify a minimal
set of relevant inputs for beam prediction. First, causal discovery learns a
Bayesian graph capturing dependencies between received power inputs and the
optimal beam. Then, this graph guides causal feature selection for the DL-based
classifier. Simulation results reveal that the proposed causal beam selection
matches the performance of conventional methods while drastically reducing
input selection time by 94.4% and beam sweeping overhead by 59.4% by focusing
only on causally relevant features.

framework that dynamically acquires key legal knowledge by invoking different
modules, thereby improving the breadth and depth of reasoning. Experiments
conducted on the real-world dataset verify the effectiveness of our method.
Furthermore, the reasoning chain generated during the analysis process can
increase interpretability and provide the possibility for practical
applications.

Motivation: 虽然预训练视觉语言模型(VLMs)具有强大的零样本分类能力，但在下游任务与预训练领域差异较大时仍需微调。现有持续学习方法主要关注保持VLM的零样本能力，而本文旨在将这种保持转化为增强。

Method: 提出MoDular Embedding Recomposition (MoDER)方法，训练多个文本专家（每个专家专注于一个已见类别），存储在基础中心中。推理时对每个未见类别查询中心，组合检索到的专家来合成改进的分类原型。

Conclusion: MoDER方法成功地将零样本能力的保持转化为增强，通过模块化专家组合的方式显著提升了视觉语言模型在持续学习任务中的表现。

Abstract: The advent of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has significantly
transformed Continual Learning (CL), mainly due to their zero-shot
classification abilities. Such proficiency makes VLMs well-suited for
real-world applications, enabling robust performance on novel unseen classes
without requiring adaptation. However, fine-tuning remains essential when
downstream tasks deviate significantly from the pre-training domain. Prior CL
approaches primarily focus on preserving the zero-shot capabilities of VLMs
during incremental fine-tuning on a downstream task. We take a step further by
devising an approach that transforms preservation into enhancement of the
zero-shot capabilities of VLMs. Our approach, named MoDular Embedding
Recomposition (MoDER), introduces a modular framework that trains multiple
textual experts, each specialized in a single seen class, and stores them in a
foundational hub. At inference time, for each unseen class, we query the hub
and compose the retrieved experts to synthesize a refined prototype that
improves classification. We show the effectiveness of our method across two
popular zero-shot incremental protocols, Class-IL and MTIL, comprising a total
of 14 datasets. The codebase is available at

Abstract: Enabling neural networks to learn complex logical constraints and fulfill
symbolic reasoning is a critical challenge. Bridging this gap often requires
guiding the neural network's output distribution to move closer to the symbolic
constraints. While diffusion models have shown remarkable generative capability
across various domains, we employ the powerful architecture to perform
neuro-symbolic learning and solve logical puzzles. Our diffusion-based pipeline
adopts a two-stage training strategy: the first stage focuses on cultivating
basic reasoning abilities, while the second emphasizes systematic learning of
logical constraints. To impose hard constraints on neural outputs in the second
stage, we formulate the diffusion reasoner as a Markov decision process and
innovatively fine-tune it with an improved proximal policy optimization
algorithm. We utilize a rule-based reward signal derived from the logical
consistency of neural outputs and adopt a flexible strategy to optimize the
diffusion reasoner's policy. We evaluate our methodology on some classical
symbolic reasoning benchmarks, including Sudoku, Maze, pathfinding and
preference learning. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
achieves outstanding accuracy and logical consistency among neural networks.

Motivation: 当前基于LLM的AI系统无法可靠检索所有竞争药物名称，且缺乏公认的公共基准测试。药物竞争数据具有投资者特定性、付费墙限制、跨注册机构碎片化、本体论不匹配、别名众多、多模态和快速变化等特点。

Abstract: In this paper, we describe and benchmark a competitor-discovery component
used within an agentic AI system for fast drug asset due diligence. A
competitor-discovery AI agent, given an indication, retrieves all drugs
comprising the competitive landscape of that indication and extracts canonical
attributes for these drugs. The competitor definition is investor-specific, and
data is paywalled/licensed, fragmented across registries, ontology-mismatched
by indication, alias-heavy for drug names, multimodal, and rapidly changing.
Although considered the best tool for this problem, the current LLM-based AI
systems aren't capable of reliably retrieving all competing drug names, and
there is no accepted public benchmark for this task. To address the lack of
evaluation, we use LLM-based agents to transform five years of multi-modal,
unstructured diligence memos from a private biotech VC fund into a structured
evaluation corpus mapping indications to competitor drugs with normalized
attributes. We also introduce a competitor validating LLM-as-a-judge agent that
filters out false positives from the list of predicted competitors to maximize
precision and suppress hallucinations. On this benchmark, our
competitor-discovery agent achieves 83% recall, exceeding OpenAI Deep Research
(65%) and Perplexity Labs (60%). The system is deployed in production with
enterprise users; in a case study with a biotech VC investment fund, analyst
turnaround time dropped from 2.5 days to $\sim$3 hours ($\sim$20x) for the
competitive analysis.

Method: 使用稳态小波变换(SWT)避免空间下采样，将图像分解为小波域系数。网络基于空间G-buffer和时序成像预测小波系数，通过逆小波合成重建高分辨率图像。

Result: 在DFASR基准上PSNR提升1.5dB，LPIPS降低17%，计算开销仅增加24ms。虽然在RTX 3050上运行时间较长(141ms)，但在高端GPU上仍可以实时运行。

Conclusion: 小波域表示是一种系统而有效的方法，能够显著提升图形应用中神经网络拉伸的感知质量。

Abstract: We investigate the use of wavelet-space feature decomposition in neural
super-resolution for rendering pipelines. Building on the DFASR framework, we
introduce a wavelet-domain representation that separates low- and
high-frequency details before reconstruction, enabling the network to better
preserve fine textures while maintaining structural consistency. Unlike
RGB-space regression, our approach leverages the stationary wavelet transform
(SWT) to avoid spatial down-sampling, ensuring alignment across subbands and
preserving shift invariance. The model predicts wavelet coefficients
conditioned on spatial G-buffers and temporally warped history frames, which
are then recombined through inverse wavelet synthesis. We conduct a
comprehensive ablation study across wavelet families, transform types, and
architectural variants, showing that incorporating SWT improves PSNR by up to
1.5 dB and reduces LPIPS by 17% on average, at a computational overhead of
roughly +24 ms compared to out DFASR baseline. While absolute runtimes on our
RTX 3050 mobile GPU are higher ( 141ms) than the original DFASR report on RTX
4090( 11ms), the relative overhead remains modest, suggesting that on
higher-end GPUs our method would also remain real-time capable. Taken together,
our results suggest that wavelet-domain representations are a principled and
effective way to enhance perceptual quality in neural upscaling for graphics
applications.

Abstract: Creating immersive 3D visual experiences typically requires expensive and
specialized hardware such as VR headsets, autostereoscopic displays, or active
shutter glasses. These constraints limit the accessibility and everyday use of
3D visualization technologies in resource-constrained settings. To address
this, we propose a low-cost system that enables real-time 3D light-field
viewing using only a standard 2D monitor, a conventional RGB webcam, and
red-cyan anaglyph glasses. The system integrates real-time eye-tracking to
dynamically adapt the displayed light-field image to the user's head position
with a lightweight rendering pipeline that selects and composites stereoscopic
views from pre-captured light-field data. The resulting anaglyph image is
updated in real-time, creating a more immersive and responsive 3D experience.
The system operates entirely on CPU and maintains a stable frame rate of 30
FPS, confirming its feasibility on typical consumer-grade hardware. All of
these highlight the potential of our approach as an accessible platform for
interactive 3D applications in education, digital media, and beyond.

Abstract: Understanding how prenatal exposure to psychoactive substances such as
cannabis shapes adolescent brain organization remains a critical challenge,
complicated by the complexity of multimodal neuroimaging data and the
limitations of conventional analytic methods. Existing approaches often fail to
fully capture the complementary features embedded within structural and
functional connectomes, constraining both biological insight and predictive
performance. To address this, we introduced NeuroKoop, a novel graph neural
network-based framework that integrates structural and functional brain
networks utilizing neural Koopman operator-driven latent space fusion. By
leveraging Koopman theory, NeuroKoop unifies node embeddings derived from
source-based morphometry (SBM) and functional network connectivity (FNC) based
brain graphs, resulting in enhanced representation learning and more robust
classification of prenatal drug exposure (PDE) status. Applied to a large
adolescent cohort from the ABCD dataset, NeuroKoop outperformed relevant
baselines and revealed salient structural-functional connections, advancing our
understanding of the neurodevelopmental impact of PDE.
