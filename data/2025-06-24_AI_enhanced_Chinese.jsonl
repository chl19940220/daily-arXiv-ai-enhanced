High-resolution soil\nmaps are essential for characterizing permafrost distribution, identifying\nvulnerable areas, and informing adaptation strategies.

As aging is closely associated with increased fall risk,\nparticularly in wet and confined environments such as bathrooms where over 80\npercent of falls occur. Although recent research has increasingly focused on\nnon-intrusive, privacy-preserving approaches that do not rely on wearable\ndevices or video-based monitoring, these efforts have not fully overcome the\nlimitations of existing unimodal systems (e.g., WiFi-, infrared-, or\nmmWave-based), which are prone to reduced accuracy in complex environments.\nThese limitations stem from fundamental constraints in unimodal sensing,\nincluding system bias and environmental interference, such as multipath fading\nin WiFi-based systems and drastic temperature changes in infrared-based\nmethods. To address these challenges, we propose a Privacy-Preserving\nMultimodal Fall Detection System for Elderly People in Bathroom Environments.\nFirst, we develop a sensor evaluation framework to select and fuse\nmillimeter-wave radar with 3D vibration sensing, and use it to construct and\npreprocess a large-scale, privacy-preserving multimodal dataset in real\nbathroom settings, which will be released upon publication. Second, we\nintroduce P2MFDS, a dual-stream network combining a CNN-BiLSTM-Attention branch\nfor radar motion dynamics with a multi-scale CNN-SEBlock-Self-Attention branch\nfor vibration impact detection. By uniting macro- and micro-scale features,\nP2MFDS delivers significant gains in accuracy and recall over state-of-the-art\napproaches.

However, in\nreal-world settings, AI systems may experience performance degradation over\ntime, due to factors such as shifting data distributions, changes in patient\ncharacteristics, evolving clinical protocols, and variations in data quality.\nThese factors can compromise model reliability, posing safety concerns and\nincreasing the likelihood of inaccurate predictions or adverse outcomes. This\nreview presents a forward-looking perspective on monitoring and maintaining the\n\"health\" of AI systems in healthcare. We highlight the urgent need for\ncontinuous performance monitoring, early degradation detection, and effective\nself-correction mechanisms. The paper begins by reviewing common causes of\nperformance degradation at both data and model levels. We then summarize key\ntechniques for detecting data and model drift, followed by an in-depth look at\nroot cause analysis. Correction strategies are further reviewed, ranging from\nmodel retraining to test-time adaptation.

Such\ninformation includes geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T), measures,\nmaterial specifications, and textual annotations. Manual extraction is slow and\nlabor-intensive, while generic OCR models often fail due to complex layouts,\nengineering symbols, and rotated text, leading to incomplete and unreliable\noutputs. These limitations result in incomplete and unreliable outputs. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a hybrid vision-language framework that\nintegrates a rotation-aware object detection model (YOLOv11-obb) with a\ntransformer-based vision-language parser. Our structured pipeline applies\nYOLOv11-OBB to localize annotations and extract oriented bounding box (OBB)\npatches, which are then parsed into structured outputs using a fine-tuned,\nlightweight vision-language model (VLM). We curate a dataset of 1,367 2D\nmechanical drawings annotated across nine key categories. YOLOv11-OBB is\ntrained on this dataset to detect OBBs and extract annotation patches. These\nare parsed using two open-source VLMs: Donut and Florence-2. Both models are\nlightweight and well-suited for specialized industrial tasks under limited\ncomputational overhead. Following fine-tuning of both models on the curated\ndataset of image patches paired with structured annotation labels, a\ncomparative experiment is conducted to evaluate parsing performance across four\nkey metrics. Donut outperforms Florence-2, achieving 88.5% precision, 99.2%\nrecall, and a 93.5% F1-score, with a hallucination rate of 11.5%.

The project page:\n  https://github.com/deep-optimization/Morse", "summary": "In this paper, we present Morse, a simple dual-sampling framework for\naccelerating diffusion models losslessly. The key insight of Morse is to\nreformulate the iterative generation (from noise to data) process via taking\nadvantage of fast jump sampling and adaptive residual feedback strategies.\nSpecifically, Morse involves two models called Dash and Dot that interact with\neach other. The Dash model is just the pre-trained diffusion model of any type,\nbut operates in a jump sampling regime, creating sufficient space for sampling\nefficiency improvement. The Dot model is significantly faster than the Dash\nmodel, which is learnt to generate residual feedback conditioned on the\nobservations at the current jump sampling point on the trajectory of the Dash\nmodel, lifting the noise estimate to easily match the next-step estimate of the\nDash model without jump sampling. By chaining the outputs of the Dash and Dot\nmodels run in a time-interleaved fashion, Morse exhibits the merit of flexibly\nattaining desired image generation performance while improving overall runtime\nefficiency. With our proposed weight sharing strategy between the Dash and Dot\nmodels, Morse is efficient for training and inference. Our method shows a\nlossless speedup of 1.78X to 3.31X on average over a wide range of sampling\nstep budgets relative to 9 baseline diffusion models on 6 image generation\ntasks. Furthermore, we show that our method can be also generalized to improve\nthe Latent Consistency Model (LCM-SDXL, which is already accelerated with\nconsistency distillation technique) tailored for few-step text-to-image\nsynthesis.

In\nthis work, we propose to instead leverage Vision Mamba RNN (VMRNN) with a\nstate-space model (SSM) and LSTM-like memory mechanisms to effectively capture\nnuanced trends in breast tissue evolution. To further enhance our approach, we\nincorporate an asymmetry module that utilizes a Spatial Asymmetry Detector\n(SAD) and Longitudinal Asymmetry Tracker (LAT) to identify clinically relevant\nbilateral differences. This integrated framework demonstrates notable\nimprovements in predicting cancer onset, especially for the more challenging\nhigh-density breast cases and achieves superior performance at extended time\npoints (years four and five), highlighting its potential to advance early\nbreast cancer recognition and enable more personalized screening strategies.\nOur code is available at https://github.com/Mortal-Suen/VMRA-MaR.git.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eVision Mamba RNN\uff08VMRNN\uff09\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\uff08SSM\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4e73\u817a\u764c\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4e73\u817a\u75c5\u4f8b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e73\u817a\u764c\u662f\u5168\u7403\u4e3b\u8981\u6b7b\u56e0\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u6700\u8fd1\u4e00\u6b21\u7b5b\u67e5\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5229\u7528\u7eb5\u5411\u5f71\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528VMRNN\u7ed3\u5408SSM\u548cLSTM\u673a\u5236\u6355\u6349\u4e73\u817a\u7ec4\u7ec7\u53d8\u5316\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6a21\u5757\uff08SAD\u548cLAT\uff09\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e34\u5e8a\u76f8\u5173\u53cc\u4fa7\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u764c\u75c7\u53d1\u75c5\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5bf9\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4e73\u817a\u75c5\u4f8b\u548c\u957f\u671f\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\uff08\u7b2c\u56db\u548c\u7b2c\u4e94\u5e74\uff09\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u671b\u63a8\u52a8\u4e73\u817a\u764c\u65e9\u671f\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7b5b\u67e5\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

In this\npaper, we tackle this problem by quantifying the prices assigned by multiple\nLLMs to a series of user discomforts: additional walking, waiting, hunger and\npain. We uncover several key concerns that strongly question the prospect of\nusing current LLMs as decision-making assistants: (1) a large variance in\nresponses between LLMs, (2) within a single LLM, responses show fragility to\nminor variations in prompt phrasing (e.g., reformulating the question in the\nfirst person can considerably alter the decision), (3) LLMs can accept\nunreasonably low rewards for major inconveniences (e.g., 1 Euro to wait 10\nhours), and (4) LLMs can reject monetary gains where no discomfort is imposed\n(e.g., 1,000 Euro to wait 0 minutes).

The key challenge of this task lies in the inherent\ncomplexities of two-person dance interactions, where the partners need to\nsynchronize both with each other and with the music. Inspired by the recent\nadvances in motion synthesis, we propose a two-stage solution: encoding\ntwo-person motions into discrete tokens and then generating these tokens from\nmusic. To effectively capture intricate interactions, we represent both\ndancers' motions as a unified whole to learn the necessary motion tokens, and\nadopt a coarse-to-fine learning strategy in both the stages. Our first stage\nutilizes a VQ-VAE that hierarchically separates high-level semantic features at\na coarse temporal resolution from low-level details at a finer resolution,\nproducing two discrete token sequences at different abstraction levels.\nSubsequently, in the second stage, two generative masked transformers learn to\nmap music signals to these dance tokens: the first producing high-level\nsemantic tokens, and the second, conditioned on music and these semantic\ntokens, producing the low-level tokens. We train both transformers to learn to\npredict randomly masked tokens within the sequence, enabling them to\niteratively generate motion tokens by filling an empty token sequence during\ninference. Through the hierarchical masked modeling and dedicated interaction\nrepresentation, DuetGen achieves the generation of synchronized and interactive\ntwo-person dances across various genres.

To this end, we present PhysUniBench, a large-scale multimodal\nbenchmark designed to evaluate and improve the reasoning capabilities of\nmultimodal large language models (MLLMs) specifically on undergraduate-level\nphysics problems. PhysUniBench consists of 3,304 physics questions spanning 8\nmajor sub-disciplines of physics, each accompanied by one visual diagrams. The\nbenchmark includes both open-ended and multiple-choice questions,\nsystematically curated and difficulty-rated through an iterative\nmodel-in-the-loop process.

Second, these works typically assume the presence of an additional\nvalidation set to fix critical hyper-parameters, which is highly\ndata-inefficient. This work challenges these favorable deployment scenarios and\nintroduces a realistic, imbalanced, validation-free adaptation setting. Our\nextensive benchmark across various modalities and downstream tasks demonstrates\nthat current methods systematically compromise their performance when operating\nunder realistic conditions, occasionally even performing worse than zero-shot\ninference. Also, we introduce a training-free linear probe that adaptively\nblends visual and textual supervision. Detailed studies demonstrate that the\nproposed solver is a strong, efficient baseline, enabling robust adaptation in\nchallenging scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u9a8c\u8bc1\u96c6\u4e14\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u5173\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u9488\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VLMs\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5047\u8bbe\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u5e73\u8861\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u9a8c\u8bc1\u96c6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u4e14\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0d\u7b26\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u878d\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u9488\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u4e14\u65e0\u9a8c\u8bc1\u96c6\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u4e0d\u5982\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u800c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u9488\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

While recent work in AI safety\nand mechanistic interpretability has advanced formal methods for alignment,\nthey often fall short of the generalisation required of control frameworks for\nother technologies. There is also a lack of research into how to render\ndifferent alignment/control protocols interoperable. We argue that by recasting\nalignment through principles of formal optimal control and framing alignment in\nterms of hierarchical stack from physical to socio-technical layers according\nto which controls may be applied we can develop a better understanding of the\npotential and limitations for controlling frontier models and agentic AI\nsystems.

This\npaper proposes a novel multi-agent system for automated fact-checking that\nenhances accuracy, efficiency, and explainability. The system comprises four\nspecialized agents: an Input Ingestion Agent for claim decomposition, a Query\nGeneration Agent for formulating targeted subqueries, an Evidence Retrieval\nAgent for sourcing credible evidence, and a Verdict Prediction Agent for\nsynthesizing veracity judgments with human-interpretable explanations.\nEvaluated on benchmark datasets (FEVEROUS, HOVER, SciFact), the proposed system\nachieves a 12.3% improvement in Macro F1-score over baseline methods.

To address\nthis challenge, we present FedMRG, the first framework that leverages Federated\nLearning (FL) to enable privacy-preserving, multi-center development of\nLLM-driven MRG models, specifically designed to overcome the critical challenge\nof communication-efficient LLM training under multi-modal data heterogeneity.\nTo start with, our framework tackles the fundamental challenge of communication\noverhead in FL-LLM tuning by employing low-rank factorization to efficiently\ndecompose parameter updates, significantly reducing gradient transmission costs\nand making LLM-driven MRG feasible in bandwidth-constrained FL settings.\nFurthermore, we observed the dual heterogeneity in MRG under the FL scenario:\nvarying image characteristics across medical centers, as well as diverse\nreporting styles and terminology preferences. To address this, we further\nenhance FedMRG with (1) client-aware contrastive learning in the MRG encoder,\ncoupled with diagnosis-driven prompts, which capture both globally\ngeneralizable and locally distinctive features while maintaining diagnostic\naccuracy; and (2) a dual-adapter mutual boosting mechanism in the MRG decoder\nthat harmonizes generic and specialized adapters to address variations in\nreporting styles and terminology.

This\nmethod is extended on the basis of the existing pre-trained Transformer model,\nand integrates a multi-stage semantic inference mechanism to realize the\ncontext understanding of system logs and the automatic reconstruction of fault\nchains. Firstly, the system log is dynamically structured, and the unsupervised\nclustering and embedding mechanism is used to extract the event template and\nsemantic schema. Subsequently, the fine-tuned LLM combined with the multi-round\nattention mechanism to perform contextual reasoning on the log sequence to\ngenerate potential fault assumptions and root cause paths. Furthermore, this\npaper introduces a reinforcement learning-based policy-guided recovery planner,\nwhich is driven by the remediation strategy generated by LLM to support dynamic\ndecision-making and adaptive debugging in the cloud environment.

Nevertheless, existing agent systems encounter notable\nlimitations. Firstly, they predominantly depend on trial and error decision\nmaking rather than progressive reasoning, thereby lacking the capability to\nlearn and adapt from interactive encounters. Secondly, these systems are\nassessed using overly simplistic single step accuracy metrics, which do not\nadequately reflect the intricate nature of real world GUI interactions. In this\npaper, we present CogniGUI, a cognitive framework developed to overcome these\nlimitations by enabling adaptive learning for GUI automation resembling\nhuman-like behavior. Inspired by Kahneman's Dual Process Theory, our approach\ncombines two main components: (1) an omni parser engine that conducts immediate\nhierarchical parsing of GUI elements through quick visual semantic analysis to\nidentify actionable components, and (2) a Group based Relative Policy\nOptimization (GRPO) grounding agent that assesses multiple interaction paths\nusing a unique relative reward system, promoting minimal and efficient\noperational routes. This dual-system design facilitates iterative ''exploration\nlearning mastery'' cycles, enabling the agent to enhance its strategies over\ntime based on accumulated experience. Moreover, to assess the generalization\nand adaptability of agent systems, we introduce ScreenSeek, a comprehensive\nbenchmark that includes multi application navigation, dynamic state\ntransitions, and cross interface coherence, which are often overlooked\nchallenges in current benchmarks.

This has led to conflicting views: some suppress\nidentity cues to reduce bias, while others rely on them as forensic evidence.\nTo reconcile these views, we analyze two hypotheses: (1) whether face identity\nalone is discriminative for detecting deepfakes, and (2) whether such identity\nfeatures generalize poorly across manipulation methods. Our experiments confirm\nthat identity is informative but context-dependent. While some manipulations\npreserve identity-consistent artifacts, others distort identity cues and harm\ngeneralization. We argue that identity features should neither be blindly\nsuppressed nor relied upon, but instead be explicitly modeled and adaptively\ncontrolled based on per-sample relevance. We propose \\textbf{SELFI}\n(\\textbf{SEL}ective \\textbf{F}usion of \\textbf{I}dentity), a generalizable\ndetection framework that dynamically modulates identity usage. SELFI consists\nof: (1) a Forgery-Aware Identity Adapter (FAIA) that extracts identity\nembeddings from a frozen face recognition model and projects them into a\nforgery-relevant space via auxiliary supervision; and (2) an Identity-Aware\nFusion Module (IAFM) that selectively integrates identity and visual features\nusing a relevance-guided fusion mechanism.

However, recent studies show that\nSDE models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which are often limited to\nunrealistic settings, e.g., digital perturbations on separate stereo views in\nstatic scenes, restricting their real-world applicability. This raises a\ncritical question: how can we design physically realizable, scene-adaptive, and\ntransferable attacks against SDE under realistic constraints?\n  To answer this, we make two key contributions. First, we propose a unified\nattack framework that extends optimization-based techniques to four core stages\nof stereo matching: feature extraction, cost-volume construction, cost\naggregation, and disparity regression. A comprehensive stage-wise evaluation\nacross 9 mainstream SDE models, under constraints like photometric consistency,\nreveals that optimization-based patches suffer from poor transferability.\nInterestingly, partially transferable patches suggest that patterns, rather\nthan pixel-level perturbations, may be key to generalizable attacks. Motivated\nby this, we present PatchHunter, the first optimization-free adversarial patch\nattack against SDE. PatchHunter formulates patch generation as a reinforcement\nlearning-driven search over a structured space of visual patterns crafted to\ndisrupt SDE assumptions.\n  We validate PatchHunter across three levels: the KITTI dataset, the CARLA\nsimulator, and real-world vehicle deployment. PatchHunter not only surpasses\noptimization-based methods in effectiveness but also achieves significantly\nbetter black-box transferability.

Existing approaches\noften rely on historical screenshots or actions to implicitly represent the\ntask state. This reliance poses challenges for GUI agents in accurately\nunderstanding task states and underscores the absence of effective mechanisms\nto store critical information in complex and lengthy cross-app tasks. To\naddress these challenges, we propose Chain-of-Memory (CoM), a novel approach\nfor explicitly modeling short-term and long-term memory in GUI agents. CoM\nachieves this by capturing action descriptions, integrating task-relevant\nscreen information, and maintaining a dedicated memory module to store and\nmanage this information. By leveraging explicit memory representations, CoM\nenables GUI agents to better understand task states and retain critical\nhistorical information persistently. To equip GUI agents with memory management\ncapabilities and evaluate the effectiveness of CoM, we developed the GUI\nOdyssey-CoM, a dataset comprising 111k screen-action pairs annotated with\nChain-of-Memory.

Egocentric vision, characterized by cameras worn by observers,\ncaptures diverse changes in illumination, viewpoint, and environment.

By\nleveraging action sequences, we aim to enhance the model's generalization\nability across unseen environments. Our proposed method, named SeqDG,\nintroduces a visual-text sequence reconstruction objective (SeqRec) that uses\ncontextual cues from both text and visual inputs to reconstruct the central\naction of the sequence.

Results on\nEPIC-KITCHENS-100, show that SeqDG leads to +2.4% relative average improvement\nin cross-domain action recognition in unseen environments, and on EGTEA the\nmodel achieved +0.6% Top-1 accuracy over SOTA in intra-domain action\nrecognition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSeqDG\u7684\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u89c6\u89d2\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e8f\u5217\u91cd\u6784\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u89c6\u89d2\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u610f\u56fe\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSeqDG\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u89c6\u89c9-\u6587\u672c\u5e8f\u5217\u91cd\u6784\u76ee\u6807\uff08SeqRec\uff09\u548c\u8de8\u57df\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e8f\u5217\u6df7\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08SeqMix\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728EPIC-KITCHENS-100\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8de8\u57df\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u53472.4%\uff1b\u5728EGTEA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u57df\u5185\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522bTop-1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u53470.6%\u3002", "conclusion": "SeqDG\u901a\u8fc7\u5e8f\u5217\u91cd\u6784\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002"}}

Using data from Allegheny\nCounty in western Pennsylvania, we find strong evidence that non-adherence\nadvances adverse outcomes by approximately 1 to 4 months.

However, most prior approaches either handle these modalities separately\nor rely on simplistic fusion strategies that ignore the directional,\nhierarchical causal interactions by which narrative observations precipitate\ndiagnoses and propagate risk across admissions. In this paper, we propose\nTHCM-CAL, a Temporal-Hierarchical Causal Model with Conformal Calibration. Our\nframework constructs a multimodal causal graph where nodes represent clinical\nentities from two modalities: Textual propositions extracted from notes and ICD\ncodes mapped to textual descriptions.

Recent\nmethods commonly utilize a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model to\nsynthesize new content of previously unseen regions along camera movement.\nHowever, the underlying 2D diffusion model lacks 3D awareness and results in\ndistorted artifacts. Moreover, they are limited to generating views of static\n3D scenes, neglecting to capture object movements within the dynamic 4D world.\nTo alleviate these issues, we present DreamJourney, a two-stage framework that\nleverages the world simulation capacity of video diffusion models to trigger a\nnew perpetual scene view generation task with both camera movements and object\ndynamics. Specifically, in stage I, DreamJourney first lifts the input image to\n3D point cloud and renders a sequence of partial images from a specific camera\ntrajectory. A video diffusion model is then utilized as generative prior to\ncomplete the missing regions and enhance visual coherence across the sequence,\nproducing a cross-view consistent video adheres to the 3D scene and camera\ntrajectory. Meanwhile, we introduce two simple yet effective strategies (early\nstopping and view padding) to further stabilize the generation process and\nimprove visual quality. Next, in stage II, DreamJourney leverages a multimodal\nlarge language model to produce a text prompt describing object movements in\ncurrent view, and uses video diffusion model to animate current view with\nobject movements. Stage I and II are repeated recurrently, enabling perpetual\ndynamic scene view generation.

During SME, the general capabilities of LLMs can be\nnegatively affected due to the introduction of new parameters. In this paper,\nwe propose a queue-based self-correction framework (QueueEDIT) that not only\nenhances SME performance by addressing long-sequence dependency but also\nmitigates the impact of parameter bias on the general capabilities of LLMs.\nSpecifically, we first introduce a structural mapping editing loss to map the\ntriplets to the knowledge-sensitive neurons within the Transformer layers of\nLLMs. We then store the located parameters for each piece of edited knowledge\nin a queue and dynamically align previously edited parameters. In each edit, we\nselect queue parameters most relevant to the currently located parameters to\ndetermine whether previous knowledge needs realignment. Irrelevant parameters\nin the queue are frozen, and we update the parameters at the queue head to the\nLLM to ensure they do not harm general abilities.

However, automated segmentation\nremains challenging due to factors such as complex organ morphologies and\nconfusing context. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Pattern\nDivide-and-Conquer Network (PDC-Net) for PRI segmentation. The core idea is to\nuse different network modules to \"divide\" various local and global patterns\nand, through flexible feature selection, to \"conquer\" the Regions of Interest\n(ROI) during the decoding phase. Specifically, considering that our ROI often\nmanifests as strip-like or circular-like structures in MR slices, we introduce\na Multi-Direction Aggregation (MDA) module. This module enhances the model's\nability to fit the shape of the organ by applying strip convolutions in four\ndistinct directions. Additionally, to mitigate the challenge of confusing\ncontext, we propose a Memory-Guided Context (MGC) module.

What drives this stability in the\ngeneration? We investigate this phenomenon through the lens of probability\nconcentration in the model's output distribution. To quantify this\nconcentration, we introduce the Branching Factor (BF) -- a token-invariant\nmeasure of the effective number of plausible next steps during generation. Our\nempirical analysis reveals two key findings: (1) BF often decreases as\ngeneration progresses, suggesting that LLMs become more predictable as they\ngenerate. (2) alignment tuning substantially sharpens the model's output\ndistribution from the outset, reducing BF by nearly an order of magnitude\n(e.g., from 12 to 1.2) relative to base models. This stark reduction helps\nexplain why aligned models often appear less sensitive to decoding strategies.\nBuilding on this insight, we find this stability has surprising implications\nfor complex reasoning. Aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) models (e.g.,\nDeepSeek-distilled models), for instance, leverage this effect; by generating\nlonger reasoning chains, they push generation into later, more deterministic\n(lower BF) stages, resulting in more stable outputs. We hypothesize that\nalignment tuning does not fundamentally change a model's behavior, but instead\nsteers it toward stylistic tokens (e.g., \"Sure\") that unlock low-entropy\ntrajectories already present in the base model. This view is supported by\nnudging experiments, which show that prompting base models with such tokens can\nsimilarly reduce BF. Together, our findings establish BF as a powerful\ndiagnostic for understanding and controlling LLM outputs - clarifying how\nalignment reduces variability, how CoT promotes stable generations, and how\nbase models can be steered away from diversity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u8f93\u51fa\u7f3a\u4e4f\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5206\u652f\u56e0\u5b50\uff08BF\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8861\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u7684\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5bf9\u9f50\u8c03\u6574\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86BF\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5176\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\u5927\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8f93\u51fa\u5f80\u5f80\u7f3a\u4e4f\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u8fd9\u79cd\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5206\u652f\u56e0\u5b50\uff08BF\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5316\u8f93\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\u6982\u7387\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790BF\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u9f50\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0BF\u968f\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u9012\u51cf\uff0c\u5bf9\u9f50\u8c03\u6574\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4eBF\uff1b\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\uff08CoT\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u5229\u7528\u4f4eBF\u9636\u6bb5\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "BF\u662f\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u63a7\u5236LLM\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u6709\u529b\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5bf9\u9f50\u5982\u4f55\u51cf\u5c11\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4ee5\u53caCoT\u5982\u4f55\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7a33\u5b9a\u751f\u6210\u3002"}}

An Empirical Study on Text-to-Image Diffusion Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Model editing offers a low-cost technique to inject or correct a particular\nbehavior in a pre-trained model without extensive retraining, supporting\napplications such as factual correction and bias mitigation. Despite this\ncommon practice, it remains unknown whether edits persist after fine-tuning or\nwhether they are inadvertently reversed. This question has fundamental\npractical implications. For example, if fine-tuning removes prior edits, it\ncould serve as a defence mechanism against hidden malicious edits. Vice versa,\nthe unintended removal of edits related to bias mitigation could pose serious\nsafety concerns. We systematically investigate the interaction between model\nediting and fine-tuning in the context of T2I diffusion models, which are known\nto exhibit biases and generate inappropriate content. Our study spans two T2I\nmodel families (Stable Diffusion and FLUX), two sota editing techniques, and\nthree fine-tuning methods (DreamBooth, LoRA, and DoRA). Through an extensive\nempirical analysis across diverse editing tasks and evaluation metrics, our\nfindings reveal a trend: edits generally fail to persist through fine-tuning,\neven when fine-tuning is tangential or unrelated to the edits. Notably, we\nobserve that DoRA exhibits the strongest edit reversal effect. At the same\ntime, among editing methods, UCE demonstrates greater robustness, retaining\nsignificantly higher efficacy post-fine-tuning compared to ReFACT. These\nfindings highlight a crucial limitation in current editing methodologies,\nemphasizing the need for more robust techniques to ensure reliable long-term\ncontrol and alignment of deployed AI systems.

In this work, we propose \\textbf{LoLA-SpecViT}(Low-rank adaptation\nLocal Attention Spectral Vision Transformer), a lightweight spectral vision\ntransformer that addresses these limitations through a parameter-efficient\narchitecture tailored to the unique characteristics of hyperspectral imagery.\nOur model combines a 3D convolutional spectral front-end with local\nwindow-based self-attention, enhancing both spectral feature extraction and\nspatial consistency while reducing computational complexity. To further improve\nadaptability, we integrate low-rank adaptation (LoRA) into attention and\nprojection layers, enabling fine-tuning with over 80\\% fewer trainable\nparameters. A novel cyclical learning rate scheduler modulates LoRA adaptation\nstrength during training, improving convergence and generalisation.

We provide an in-depth experimental\nevaluation of our solution, demonstrating its capability to extract accurate\ninformation that can be applied to different types of content across PDFs.

In\norder to analyze the dynamic and static components of videos acquired under\nundesirable conditions, such as hardware, environmental, and power limitations,\nit is essential to establish an FBS method that can handle videos with low\nframe rates and various types of noise. Existing FBS methods have two\nlimitations that prevent us from accurately separating foreground and\nbackground components from such degraded videos. First, they only capture\neither data-specific or general features of the components. Second, they do not\ninclude explicit models for various types of noise to remove them in the FBS\nprocess. To this end, we propose a robust FBS method with a CSR-based\nforeground model. This model can adaptively capture specific spatial structures\nscattered in imaging data. Then, we formulate FBS as a constrained multiconvex\noptimization problem that incorporates CSR, functions that capture general\nfeatures, and explicit noise characterization functions for multiple types of\nnoise.

In this paper, we propose Programming by\nBackprop (PBB) as a potential driver of this effect - teaching a model to\nevaluate a program for inputs by training on its source code alone, without\never seeing I/O examples. To explore this idea, we finetune LLMs on two sets of\nprograms representing simple maths problems and algorithms: one with source\ncode and I/O examples (w/ IO), the other with source code only (w/o IO). We\nfind evidence that LLMs have some ability to evaluate w/o IO programs for\ninputs in a range of experimental settings, and make several observations.\nFirstly, PBB works significantly better when programs are provided as code\nrather than semantically equivalent language descriptions. Secondly, LLMs can\nproduce outputs for w/o IO programs directly, by implicitly evaluating the\nprogram within the forward pass, and more reliably when stepping through the\nprogram in-context via chain-of-thought. We further show that PBB leads to more\nrobust evaluation of programs across inputs than training on I/O pairs drawn\nfrom a distribution that mirrors naturally occurring data. Our findings suggest\na mechanism for enhanced reasoning through code training: it allows LLMs to\ninternalise reusable algorithmic abstractions. Significant scope remains for\nfuture work to enable LLMs to more effectively learn from symbolic procedures,\nand progress in this direction opens other avenues like model alignment by\ntraining on formal constitutional principles.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faProgramming by Backprop\uff08PBB\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u8bad\u7ec3\u589e\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22LLMs\u901a\u8fc7\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u65e0\u9700\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u793a\u4f8b\uff08I/O\uff09\u65f6\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03LLMs\u5728\u4e24\u7ec4\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff08\u5e26I/O\u548c\u4e0d\u5e26I/O\uff09\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5176\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0PBB\u5728\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u4e14LLMs\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u9690\u5f0f\u8bc4\u4f30\u7a0b\u5e8f\u751f\u6210\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u8003\uff08chain-of-thought\uff09\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f7fLLMs\u5185\u5316\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u7b97\u6cd5\u62bd\u8c61\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u53ef\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u7b26\u53f7\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u3002"}}

Secondly, synthetic models fall short of\nmatching the performance of real data, even for in-domain downstream\napplications. Recent methods for image generation have focused on maximising\nimage diversity instead of fidelity solely to improve the mode coverage and\ntherefore the downstream performance of synthetic data. In this work, we shift\nperspective and highlight how maximizing diversity can also be interpreted as\nprotecting natural persons from being singled out, which leads to predicate\nsingling-out (PSO) secure synthetic datasets. Specifically, we propose a\ngeneralisable framework for training diffusion models on personal data which\nleads to unpersonal synthetic datasets achieving performance within one\npercentage point of real-data models while significantly outperforming\nstate-of-the-art methods that do not ensure privacy.

While\nwritten GEC is well-established, spoken GEC (SGEC), aiming to provide feedback\nbased on learners' speech, poses additional challenges due to disfluencies,\ntranscription errors, and the lack of structured input. SGEC systems typically\nfollow a cascaded pipeline consisting of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR),\ndisfluency detection, and GEC, making them vulnerable to error propagation\nacross modules.

Cascaded, partial-cascaded and E2E architectures are\ncompared, all built on the Whisper foundation model. A challenge for E2E\nsystems is the scarcity of GEC labeled spoken data. To address this, an\nautomatic pseudo-labeling framework is examined, increasing the training data\nfrom 77 to over 2500 hours. To improve the accuracy of the SGEC system,\nadditional contextual information, exploiting the ASR output, is investigated.\nCandidate feedback of their mistakes is an essential step to improving\nperformance. In E2E systems the SGEC output must be compared with an estimate\nof the fluent transcription to obtain the feedback.

However, the inherent spatial heterogeneity of WSIs presents\ncritical challenges, as morphologically similar tissue types are often\ndispersed across distant anatomical regions. Conventional MIL methods struggle\nto model these scattered tissue distributions and capture cross-regional\nspatial interactions effectively. To address these limitations, we propose a\nnovel Multiple instance learning framework with Context-Aware Clustering\n(MiCo), designed to enhance cross-regional intra-tissue correlations and\nstrengthen inter-tissue semantic associations in WSIs. MiCo begins by\nclustering instances to distill discriminative morphological patterns, with\ncluster centroids serving as semantic anchors. To enhance cross-regional\nintra-tissue correlations, MiCo employs a Cluster Route module, which\ndynamically links instances of the same tissue type across distant regions via\nfeature similarity. These semantic anchors act as contextual hubs, propagating\nsemantic relationships to refine instance-level representations. To eliminate\nsemantic fragmentation and strengthen inter-tissue semantic associations, MiCo\nintegrates a Cluster Reducer module, which consolidates redundant anchors while\nenhancing information exchange between distinct semantic groups. Extensive\nexperiments on two challenging tasks across nine large-scale public cancer\ndatasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MiCo, showcasing its superiority over\nstate-of-the-art methods.

Weakly supervised learning\nprovides a more efficient alternative by leveraging sparse and coarse\nannotations instead of dense, precise ones.

CmFNet consists of three main\ncomponents: a modality-specific feature learning network, a cross-modal feature\nlearning network, and a hybrid-supervised learning strategy. Specifically, the\nmodality-specific feature learning network and the cross-modal feature learning\nnetwork effectively integrate complementary information from multi-modal\nimages, enhancing shared features across modalities to improve segmentation\nperformance.

Our proposed Incremental\nTraining Strategy consists of four stages. Stage 1 injects domain knowledge by\nperforming Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to the pretrained model on the COT\ndata. Stage 2 aligns the COT data format by conducting a small amount of Group\nRelative Policy Optimization (GRPO) training constrained only by format rewards\non the COT data. Stage 3 enhances reasoning ability by applying GRPO training\non the COT data with constraints on both format and accuracy rewards. The\nresulting model shows significant improvement compared to the baseline. Stage 4\naddresses the limited capacity of the SVLMs and the weak ability to capture\ncomplex patterns by proposing ClipLow GRPO (CLGRPO) to constrain the capture\nspace of the training process.

One of the most popular\napplications of LLMs are chatbots that interact with users.

So, a question that\nimmediately arises is whether there is a potential benefit in optimizing\ntokenizers for chatbot conversations.

The results show that conversation-optimized tokenizers\nconsistently reduce the number of tokens in chatbot dialogues, which can lead\nto meaningful energy savings, in the range of 5% to 10% while having minimal or\neven slightly positive impact on tokenization efficiency for the original\ntraining corpus.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4e3a\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4f18\u5316\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u597d\u5904\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e865%\u523010%\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u8282\u7701\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u6210\u672c\u56e0\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5927\u548c\u7528\u6237\u6570\u91cf\u6fc0\u589e\u800c\u6025\u5267\u4e0a\u5347\u3002\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7387\u4e2d\u8d77\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u804a\u5929\u5bf9\u8bdd\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u516c\u5f00\u7684\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u5bf9\u8bdd\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u5728\u804a\u5929\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4ee4\u724c\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e865%\u523010%\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u8282\u7701\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5bf9\u539f\u59cb\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u6548\u7387\u5f71\u54cd\u6781\u5c0f\u751a\u81f3\u7565\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4f18\u5316\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u76ca\uff0c\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u80fd\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u7565\u5fae\u63d0\u5347\u539f\u6709\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Previous approaches, exemplified by LongWriter, typically rely on\n''teaching'', which involves supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on synthetic\nlong-form outputs. However, this strategy heavily depends on synthetic SFT\ndata, which is difficult and costly to construct, often lacks coherence and\nconsistency, and tends to be overly artificial and structurally monotonous. In\nthis work, we propose an incentivization-based approach that, starting entirely\nfrom scratch and without relying on any annotated or synthetic data, leverages\nreinforcement learning (RL) to foster the emergence of ultra-long, high-quality\ntext generation capabilities in LLMs. We perform RL training starting from a\nbase model, similar to R1-Zero, guiding it to engage in reasoning that\nfacilitates planning and refinement during the writing process.

We first introduce additive quantization with a\nlightweight encoder and codebook to compress the KV cache, which can be decoded\nvia simple matrix multiplication. To further reduce computational costs during\ndecoding, we design the codebook to be commutative with Rotary Position\nEmbedding (RoPE) and train it using an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.\nThis enables efficient integration of decoding into the self-attention\nmechanism. Our approach achieves high accuracy with additive quantization and\nlow overhead via the RoPE-commutative codebook.

Drive-R1\nfirst undergoes the supervised finetuning on a elaborate dataset containing\nboth long and short COT data. Drive-R1 is encouraged to reason step-by-step\nfrom visual input to final planning decisions. Subsequently, Drive-R1 is\ntrained within a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes the\ndiscovery of reasoning paths that are more informative for planning, guided by\nrewards based on predicted trajectories and meta actions. Experimental\nevaluations on the nuScenes and DriveLM-nuScenes benchmarks demonstrate that\nDrive-R1 achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art\nVLMs. We believe that Drive-R1 presents a promising direction for bridging\nreasoning and planning in AD, offering methodological insights for future\nresearch and applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faDrive-R1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5386\u53f2\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u89c4\u5212\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3VLM\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u5386\u53f2\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u89c4\u5212\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u4e24\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "Drive-R1\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u4ece\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u63a8\u7406\u5230\u89c4\u5212\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "result": "\u5728nuScenes\u548cDriveLM-nuScenes\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709VLM\u3002", "conclusion": "Drive-R1\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u89c4\u5212\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u542f\u793a\u3002"}}

Although\nthree-dimensional (3D) sensing technologies have been developed for plant and\ncanopy reconstruction, severe occlusion and complex architectures hinder\naccurate canopy descriptions. In this study, we propose a point cloud\ncompletion model for 3D reconstruction of rapeseed populations from seeding to\nsilique stages using multi-view imaging. A complete point cloud generation\nframework was developed with the virtual-real integration (VRI) simulation\nmethod and occlusion point detection algorithm to annotate the training dataset\nby distinguishing surface from occluded points. The rapeseed population point\ncloud completion network (RP-PCN) was designed with a multi-resolution dynamic\ngraph convolutional encoder (MRDG) and point pyramid decoder (PPD) to predict\noccluded points based on input surface point clouds. A dynamic graph\nconvolutional feature extractor (DGCFE) was introduced to capture structural\nvariations across the growth period. The effectiveness of point cloud\ncompletion was validated by predicting yield using architectural indicators\nfrom complete point clouds of rapeseed population. The results demonstrated\nthat RP-PCN achieved chamfer distance (CD) values of 3.35 cm, 3.46 cm, 4.32 cm,\nand 4.51 cm at the seedling, bolting, flowering, and silique stages,\nrespectively. Ablation studies showed the effectiveness of the MRDG and DGCFE\nmodules, reducing CD values by 10% and 23%, respectively. The silique\nefficiency index (SEI) from RP-PCN improved yield prediction accuracy by 11.2%\ncompared to incomplete point clouds.

An intriguing challenge arises when agents\ninteract with the world as a dynamic data stream and ad-hoc queries from users:\nsupporting knowledge for queries, namely evidence, usually appears\nasynchronously with the arrival time of queries, and agents need to ground\ntheir responses in historical data, present observations, and even future\nstreams. We frame this challenge as Query-Evidence Asynchrony, where user\nqueries and their supporting evidence typically arrive asynchronously in the\nstreaming setting. This setting requires not only strong reasoning capabilities\nbut also the ability to retain past observations and respond to queries with\ntemporal awareness. In this paper, we introduce a diagnostic benchmark that\nevaluates Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on their ability to handle\ninteraction with streaming data.

This decomposition allows us to identify and quantify the sources\nof teacher bias. To address them, we introduce (1) a rebalanced inter-group\nloss that calibrates the teacher's group-level predictions and (2) a uniform\nintra-group loss that ensures equal contribution from all groups during\ndistillation. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100-LT, TinyImageNet-LT, and\nImageNet-LT show that LTKD consistently outperforms existing KD methods,\nachieving significant gains in both overall accuracy and tail-class\nperformance.

The concept of\nrevocable biometrics was developed to address this concern. A biometric scheme\nis revocable if an individual can have their current enrollment in the scheme\nrevoked, so that the compromised biometric template becomes worthless, and the\nindividual can re-enroll with a new template that has similar recognition\npower. We show that modern deep CNN face matchers inherently allow for a robust\nrevocable biometric scheme.

The equivalent recognition power\nextends to the point of generating impostor and genuine distributions that have\nthe same shape and placement on the similarity dimension, meaning that the\nmodels can share a similarity threshold for a 1-in-10,000 false match rate. The\nbiometric templates from different model instances are so strongly incompatible\nthat the cross-instance similarity score for images of the same person is\ntypically lower than the same-instance similarity score for images of different\npersons.

Firstly, the\nnext-token-prediction capability of the AR model significantly enhances its\neffectiveness in facilitating progressive multi-view synthesis.

To manage multi-modal\nconditions simultaneously, a progressive training strategy is employed. This\nstrategy initially adopts the text-to-multi-view (t2mv) model as a baseline to\nenhance the development of a comprehensive X-to-multi-view (X2mv) model through\nthe randomly dropping and combining conditions. Finally, to alleviate the\noverfitting problem caused by limited high-quality data, we propose the\n\"Shuffle View\" data augmentation technique, thus significantly expanding the\ntraining data by several magnitudes. Experiments demonstrate the performance\nand versatility of our MV-AR, which consistently generates consistent\nmulti-view images across a range of conditions and performs on par with leading\ndiffusion-based multi-view image generation models.

Existing encoder decoder based methods\ntypically compress inputs into low-dimensional bottlenecks on the assumption\nthat the compression process can effectively suppress the transmission of\nlogical anomalies to the decoder. However, logical anomalies present a\nparticular difficulty because, while their local features often resemble normal\nsemantics, their global semantics deviate significantly from normal patterns.\nThanks to the generalisation capabilities inherent in neural networks, these\nabnormal semantic features can propagate through low-dimensional bottlenecks.\nThis ultimately allows the decoder to reconstruct anomalous images with\nmisleading fidelity. To tackle the above challenge, we propose a novel\nnormality prior guided multi-semantic fusion network for unsupervised anomaly\ndetection. Instead of feeding the compressed bottlenecks to the decoder\ndirectly, we introduce the multi-semantic features of normal samples into the\nreconstruction process. To this end, we first extract abstract global semantics\nof normal cases by a pre-trained vision-language network, then the learnable\nsemantic codebooks are constructed to store representative feature vectors of\nnormal samples by vector quantisation. Finally, the above multi-semantic\nfeatures are fused and employed as input to the decoder to guide the\nreconstruction of anomalies to approximate normality.

Existing methods, including encoder-decoder networks and prompt-driven\nvariants of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), rely heavily on local cues or\nuser prompts and lack integrated semantic priors, thus failing to generalize\nwell to low-contrast or overlapping targets. To address these issues, we\npropose MedSeg-R, a lightweight, dual-stage framework inspired by inspired by\nclinical reasoning. Its cognitive stage interprets medical report into\nstructured semantic priors (location, texture, shape), which are fused via\ntransformer block.

Effective alignment between motion and musical beats\nenhances viewer engagement and visual appeal, particularly in music videos,\npromotional content, and cinematic editing.

While some generative models\nhandle joint video and music generation, they often entangle the two\nmodalities, limiting flexibility in aligning video to music beats while\npreserving the full visual content. In this paper, we propose a novel and\nefficient framework, termed MVAA (Music-Video Auto-Alignment), that\nautomatically edits video to align with the rhythm of a given music track while\npreserving the original visual content. To enhance flexibility, we modularize\nthe task into a two-step process in our MVAA: aligning motion keyframes with\naudio beats, followed by rhythm-aware video inpainting. Specifically, we first\ninsert keyframes at timestamps aligned with musical beats, then use a\nframe-conditioned diffusion model to generate coherent intermediate frames,\npreserving the original video's semantic content.

However,\nexisting film generation systems struggle to implement cinematic principles and\nthus fail to generate professional-quality films, particularly lacking diverse\ncamera language and cinematic rhythm.

To address this, we introduce FilMaster, an end-to-end\nAI system that integrates real-world cinematic principles for\nprofessional-grade film generation, yielding editable, industry-standard\noutputs. FilMaster is built on two key principles: (1) learning cinematography\nfrom extensive real-world film data and (2) emulating professional,\naudience-centric post-production workflows. Inspired by these principles,\nFilMaster incorporates two stages: a Reference-Guided Generation Stage which\ntransforms user input to video clips, and a Generative Post-Production Stage\nwhich transforms raw footage into audiovisual outputs by orchestrating visual\nand auditory elements for cinematic rhythm. Our generation stage highlights a\nMulti-shot Synergized RAG Camera Language Design module to guide the AI in\ngenerating professional camera language by retrieving reference clips from a\nvast corpus of 440,000 film clips. Our post-production stage emulates\nprofessional workflows by designing an Audience-Centric Cinematic Rhythm\nControl module, including Rough Cut and Fine Cut processes informed by\nsimulated audience feedback, for effective integration of audiovisual elements\nto achieve engaging content. The system is empowered by generative AI models\nlike (M)LLMs and video generation models. Furthermore, we introduce FilmEval, a\ncomprehensive benchmark for evaluating AI-generated films.

To address these limitations, we introduce\nSurfel-Indexed View Memory (VMem), a mechanism that remembers past views by\nindexing them geometrically based on the 3D surface elements (surfels) they\nhave observed. VMem enables the efficient retrieval of the most relevant past\nviews when generating new ones. By focusing only on these relevant views, our\nmethod produces consistent explorations of imagined environments at a fraction\nof the computational cost of using all past views as context.

Starting from the video preliminarily relighted by an\ninflated video relighting model, it optimizes appearance embedding in the first\nstage to align global illumination. Then it optimizes the proposed canonical\nvideo representation, i.e., Unique Video Tensor (UVT), to align fine-grained\ntexture and lighting in the second stage. To comprehensively evaluate\nperformance, we also establish a long and highly dynamic video benchmark.\nExtensive experiments show that our method enables physically plausible\nrelighting results with superior temporal coherence and low computation cost.\nThe code and video demos are available at\nhttps://dekuliutesla.github.io/tclight/.", "AI": {"tldr": "TC-Light\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u4f18\u5316\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5149\u7167\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u6280\u672f\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u8096\u50cf\u89c6\u9891\u6216\u5b58\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0cTC-Light\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u540e\u4f18\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u4f18\u5316\u5916\u89c2\u5d4c\u5165\u4ee5\u5bf9\u9f50\u5168\u5c40\u5149\u7167\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u552f\u4e00\u89c6\u9891\u5f20\u91cf\uff08UVT\uff09\u4ee5\u5bf9\u9f50\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7eb9\u7406\u548c\u5149\u7167\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTC-Light\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u7269\u7406\u4e0a\u5408\u7406\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u7684\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "TC-Light\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u5149\u7167\u7f16\u8f91\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}
