The temporal coherence inherent in these tasks presents an opportunity to reuse intermediate results from previous frames and avoid redundant computations. Recent work has shown that caching intermediate features to be reused in subsequent inferences is an effective method to reduce latency in diffusion models. We extend this idea to real-time rendering and present ReFrame, which explores different caching policies to optimize trade-offs between quality and performance in rendering workloads. ReFrame can be applied to a variety of encoder-decoder style networks commonly found in rendering pipelines. Experimental results show that we achieve 1.4x speedup on average with negligible quality loss in three real-time rendering tasks.

However, there still lacks a comprehensive metric for assessing the editing quality. Existing metrics either require high human evaluation costs, which hinder large-scale evaluation, or are adapted from other tasks and lose task-specific concerns, failing to comprehensively evaluate both instruction-based modification and preservation of irrelevant regions, resulting in biased evaluation. To tackle this, we introduce a new metric called Balancing Preservation and Modification (BPM), tailored for instruction-based image editing by explicitly disentangling the image into editing-relevant and irrelevant regions for specific consideration. We first identify and locate editing-relevant regions, followed by a two-tier process to assess editing quality: Region-Aware Judge evaluates whether the position and size of the edited region align with the instruction, and Semantic-Aware Judge further assesses the instruction content compliance within editing-relevant regions as well as content preservation within irrelevant regions, yielding comprehensive and interpretable quality assessment. Moreover, the editing-relevant region localization in BPM can be integrated into image editing approaches to improve editing quality, demonstrating its broad applicability. We verify the effectiveness of the BPM metric on comprehensive instruction-editing data, and the results show the highest alignment with human evaluation compared to existing metrics, indicating its efficacy.

However, existing methods often rely on either high-poly mesh modeling with post-hoc simplification or massive 3D Gaussians, resulting in a complex pipeline or limited visual realism. In this paper, we demonstrate that such exhaustive modeling is unnecessary for achieving compelling immersive experience. We introduce ImmerseGen, a novel agent-guided framework for compact and photorealistic world modeling. ImmerseGen represents scenes as hierarchical compositions of lightweight geometric proxies, i.e., simplified terrain and billboard meshes, and generates photorealistic appearance by synthesizing RGBA textures onto these proxies. Specifically, we propose terrain-conditioned texturing for user-centric base world synthesis, and RGBA asset texturing for midground and foreground scenery.This reformulation offers several advantages: (i) it simplifies modeling by enabling agents to guide generative models in producing coherent textures that integrate seamlessly with the scene; (ii) it bypasses complex geometry creation and decimation by directly synthesizing photorealistic textures on proxies, preserving visual quality without degradation; (iii) it enables compact representations suitable for real-time rendering on mobile VR headsets. To automate scene creation from text prompts, we introduce VLM-based modeling agents enhanced with semantic grid-based analysis for improved spatial reasoning and accurate asset placement. ImmerseGen further enriches scenes with dynamic effects and ambient audio to support multisensory immersion. Experiments on scene generation and live VR showcases demonstrate that ImmerseGen achieves superior photorealism, spatial coherence and rendering efficiency compared to prior methods.

For this purpose, we consider the Delaunay triangulation of template features as an useful tool through which to be guided in this iterative approach. The triangulation is treated as a graph and, starting from a single triangle, neighboring nodes are considered and the corresponding features are identified; then matches related to them are evaluated to determine if they are worthy to be grouped. This evaluation is based on local consistency criteria derived from geometric and photometric properties of local features. Our solution allows the identification of the object in situations where geometric models (e.g. homography) does not hold, thus enable the detection of objects such that the template is non planar or when it is planar but appears distorted in the image.

Natural language processing technologies, represented by Large Language Models (LLMs), have been widely applied to climate change-specific research, providing essential information support for decision-makers and the public. Some studies have improved model performance on relevant tasks by constructing climate change-related instruction data and instruction-tuning LLMs. However, current research remains inadequate in efficiently producing large volumes of high-precision instruction data for climate change, which limits further development of climate change LLMs. This study introduces an automated method for constructing instruction data. The method generates instructions using facts and background knowledge from documents and enhances the diversity of the instruction data through web scraping and the collection of seed instructions. Using this method, we constructed a climate change instruction dataset, named ClimateChat-Corpus, which was used to fine-tune open-source LLMs, resulting in an LLM named ClimateChat. Evaluation results show that ClimateChat significantly improves performance on climate change question-and-answer tasks. Additionally, we evaluated the impact of different base models and instruction data on LLM performance and demonstrated its capability to adapt to a wide range of climate change scientific discovery tasks, emphasizing the importance of selecting an appropriate base model for instruction tuning.

It augments virtual CAD models of buildings on the ground, enabling users to manipulate and visualize an architectural model before actual construction.

These methods remain a fundamental component of modern applications. However, animatable digital asset creation predominantly remains a manual process. Current automated tools often fall short of delivering the desired level of quality for intricate and complex geometries, requiring manual touch-ups. We propose a fully automatic and robust method for generating high quality skinning weights given a user-provided skeleton and mesh in A- or T-pose. Notably, our approach provides direct sparsity controls, limiting the number of bone influences per vertex, which is essential for efficient asset creation for large-scale mobile experiences with multiple concurrent users. Our method additionally addresses the need for level-of-detail (LoD) variations in performance-sensitive applications, which are exacerbated on mobile platforms. By optimizing weights in space rather than on discrete points, we enable a single optimization result to be seamlessly applied to all levels of detail of that asset or even variations of that asset. To achieve this, we introduce a novel parameterized family of functions called SkinCells.

However, concerns persist around their potential to replicate and magnify existing societal biases. To investigate these issues, we curated a diverse set of prompts spanning thematic categories such as occupations, traits, actions, ideologies, emotions, family roles, place descriptions, spirituality, and life events. For each of the 160 unique topics, we crafted multiple prompt variations to reflect a wide range of meanings and perspectives. Using Stable Diffusion 1.5 (UNet-based) and Flux-1 (DiT-based) models with original checkpoints, we generated over 16,000 images under consistent settings. Additionally, we collected 8,000 comparison images from Google Image Search. All outputs were filtered to exclude abstract, distorted, or nonsensical results. Our analysis reveals significant disparities in the representation of gender, race, age, somatotype, and other human-centric factors across generated images. These disparities often mirror and reinforce harmful stereotypes embedded in societal narratives.

The Vision-Language Reward Model (VL-RM) is key to aligning VL models by providing structured feedback, yet training effective VL-RMs faces two major challenges. First, the bootstrapping dilemma arises as high-quality training data depends on already strong VL models, creating a cycle where self-generated supervision reinforces existing biases. Second, modality bias and negative example amplification occur when VL models hallucinate incorrect visual attributes, leading to flawed preference data that further misguides training. To address these issues, we propose an iterative training framework leveraging vision experts, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales, and Margin-based Rejection Sampling.

To close this gap, our work explores learning the correspondence between LiDAR point clouds, human skeleton poses, IMU data, and text in a joint embedding space. More specifically, we present DeSPITE, a Deep Skeleton-Pointcloud-IMU-Text Embedding model, which effectively learns a joint embedding space across these four modalities through noise contrastive estimation. At the heart of our empirical exploration, we have combined the existing LIPD and Babel datasets, which enabled us to synchronize data of all four modalities, allowing us to explore the learning of a new joint embedding space. Our experiments demonstrate novel human activity understanding tasks for point cloud sequences enabled through DeSPITE, including Skeleton<->Pointcloud<->IMU matching, retrieval, and temporal moment retrieval.

As large language models (LLMs) enter high-stakes domains like education, healthcare, governance, and law, their behavior must reliably reflect human-aligned values and safety constraints. Yet current evaluations rely heavily on behavioral proxies such as refusal rates, G-Eval scores, and toxicity classifiers, all of which have critical blind spots. Aligned models are often vulnerable to jailbreaking, stochasticity of generation, and alignment faking.\n  To address this issue, we introduce the Alignment Quality Index (AQI). This novel geometric and prompt-invariant metric empirically assesses LLM alignment by analyzing the separation of safe and unsafe activations in latent space. By combining measures such as the Davies-Bouldin Score (DBS), Dunn Index (DI), Xie-Beni Index (XBI), and Calinski-Harabasz Index (CHI) across various formulations, AQI captures clustering quality to detect hidden misalignments and jailbreak risks, even when outputs appear compliant. AQI also serves as an early warning signal for alignment faking, offering a robust, decoding invariant tool for behavior agnostic safety auditing.\n  Additionally, we propose the LITMUS dataset to facilitate robust evaluation under these challenging conditions. Empirical tests on LITMUS across different models trained under DPO, GRPO, and RLHF conditions demonstrate AQI's correlation with external judges and ability to reveal vulnerabilities missed by refusal metrics.

Large-scale remote sensing, such as satellite imagery, is an important tool for this task. However, using supervised methods to detect changes is difficult because of the lack of satellite data annotated with change labels, especially for rare categories of change. Annotation proves challenging due to the sparse occurrence of changes in satellite images. Even within a vast collection of images, only a small fraction may exhibit persistent changes of interest. To address this challenge, we introduce OPTIMUS, a self-supervised learning method based on an intuitive principle: if a model can recover information about the relative order of images in the time series, then that implies that there are long-lasting changes in the images. OPTIMUS demonstrates this principle by using change point detection methods on model outputs in a time series. We demonstrate that OPTIMUS can directly detect interesting changes in satellite images, achieving an improvement in AUROC score from 56.3% to 87.6% at distinguishing changed time series from unchanged ones compared to baselines.

Vision-only methods often struggle to generalize, resulting in pixel misclassification between similar classes, poor generalization and boundary localization. Vision-Language Models offer robust, domain-invariant semantics but lack the spatial grounding required for dense prediction. We introduce HierVL, a unified framework that bridges this gap by integrating abstract text embeddings into a mask-transformer architecture tailored for semi-supervised segmentation. HierVL features three novel components: a Hierarchical Semantic Query Generator that filters and projects abstract class embeddings into multi-scale queries to suppress irrelevant classes and handle intra-class variability; a Cross-Modal Spatial Alignment Module that aligns semantic queries with pixel features for sharper boundaries under sparse supervision; and a Dual-Query Transformer Decoder that fuses semantic and instance-level queries to prevent instance collapse. We also introduce targeted regularization losses that maintain vision-language alignment throughout training to reinforce semantic grounding. HierVL establishes a new state-of-the-art by achieving a +4.4% mean improvement of the intersection over the union on COCO (with 232 labeled images), +3.1% on Pascal VOC (with 92 labels), +5.9% on ADE20 (with 158 labels) and +1.8% on Cityscapes (with 100 labels), demonstrating better performance under 1% supervision on four benchmark datasets.

Current AI systems based on large language models (LLMs) can provide feedback that makes people feel heard. Yet it remains unclear whether LLMs represent emotion in language as humans do, or whether and how the emotional tone of their output can be controlled. We assess human-AI emotional alignment across linguistic-cultural groups and model-families, using interpretable LLM features translated from concept-sets for over twenty nuanced emotion categories (including six basic emotions). Our analyses reveal that LLM-derived emotion spaces are structurally congruent with human perception, underpinned by the fundamental affective dimensions of valence and arousal. Furthermore, these emotion-related features also accurately predict large-scale behavioural data on word ratings along these two core dimensions, reflecting both universal and language-specific patterns. Finally, by leveraging steering vectors derived solely from human-centric emotion concepts, we show that model expressions can be stably and naturally modulated across distinct emotion categories, which provides causal evidence that human emotion concepts can be used to systematically induce LLMs to produce corresponding affective states when conveying content.

However, detecting and localizing unknown objects is crucial for safety-critical applications in domains such as autonomous driving and medical imaging. Recently, Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) detection has emerged as a vital research direction for OD, focusing on identifying incorrect predictions typically associated with unknown objects. This paper shows that the current evaluation protocol for OOD-OD violates the assumption of non-overlapping objects with respect to the In-Distribution (ID) datasets, and obscures crucial situations such as ignoring unknown objects, potentially leading to overconfidence in deployment scenarios where truly novel objects might be encountered. To address these limitations, we manually curate, and enrich the existing benchmark by exploiting semantic similarity to create new evaluation splits categorized as $\\textit{near}$, $\\textit{far}$, and $\\textit{farther}$ from ID distributions. Additionally, we incorporate established metrics from the Open Set community, providing deeper insights into how effectively methods detect unknowns, when they ignore them, and when they mistakenly classify OOD objects as ID. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that semantically and visually close OOD objects are easier to localize than far ones, but are also more easily confounded with ID objects. $\\textit{Far}$ and $\\textit{farther}$ objects are harder to localize but less prone to be taken for an ID object.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u5f53\u524dOOD-OD\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u5b58\u5728\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u6307\u6807\u4ee5\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u5730\u8861\u91cf\u672a\u77e5\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5c01\u95ed\u4e16\u754c\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u68c0\u6d4b\u672a\u77e5\u7269\u4f53\u3002\u5f53\u524dOOD-OD\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u81ea\u4fe1\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u624b\u52a8\u6784\u5efa\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08near\u3001far\u3001farther\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5f00\u653e\u96c6\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u63a5\u8fd1\u7684OOD\u7269\u4f53\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u4e0eID\u7269\u4f53\u6df7\u6dc6\uff1bfar\u548cfarther\u7269\u4f53\u66f4\u96be\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4f46\u4e0d\u6613\u88ab\u8bef\u8ba4\u4e3aID\u7269\u4f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u6307\u6807\u80fd\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u5730\u8861\u91cfOOD-OD\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u3002"}}

In this setting, we assume we use a pre-trained large vision-language model (LVLM; CLIP) to generate from a smaller 2D dataset with no additional paired labels and with a pre-defined 3D morphable model (FLAME). First, we disentangle using canonicalization to a 2D reference frame from a deformable neural 3D triplane representation. But another form of entanglement arises from the significant noise in the LVLM's embedding space that describes irrelevant features. This damages output quality and diversity, but we overcome this with a Jacobian regularization that can be computed efficiently with a stochastic approximator.

To handle multi-modality, recent methods follow a similar Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, but utilize Visual Language Models (VLMs) based embedding model to embed and retrieve relevant pages as images, and generate answers with VLMs that can accept an image as input. In this paper, we introduce SimpleDoc, a lightweight yet powerful retrieval - augmented framework for DocVQA. It boosts evidence page gathering by first retrieving candidates through embedding similarity and then filtering and re-ranking these candidates based on page summaries. A single VLM-based reasoner agent repeatedly invokes this dual-cue retriever, iteratively pulling fresh pages into a working memory until the question is confidently answered.

Existing approaches typically treat all facial pixels equally, resulting in suboptimal allocation of computational resources and degraded FSR performance. CNN is relatively sensitive to high-frequency facial features, such as component contours and facial outlines. Meanwhile, Mamba excels at capturing low-frequency features like facial color and fine-grained texture, and does so with lower complexity than Transformers. Motivated by these observations, we propose FADPNet, a Frequency-Aware Dual-Path Network that decomposes facial features into low- and high-frequency components and processes them via dedicated branches.

While existing methods achieve strong performance, balancing accuracy and real-time inference remains a challenge. To address this, we propose a logits-based knowledge distillation framework for MOS, aiming to improve accuracy while maintaining real-time efficiency. Specifically, we adopt a Bird's Eye View (BEV) projection-based model as the student and a non-projection model as the teacher. To handle the severe imbalance between moving and non-moving classes, we decouple them and apply tailored distillation strategies, allowing the teacher model to better learn key motion-related features. This approach significantly reduces false positives and false negatives. Additionally, we introduce dynamic upsampling, optimize the network architecture, and achieve a 7.69% reduction in parameter count, mitigating overfitting.

We experiment on IU-xray dataset, which exhibits the aforementioned criteria, and evaluate BiomedCLIP in classifying images (radiographs) in three contexts: zero-shot inference, full finetuning, and linear probing. The results show that the model under zero-shot settings over-predicts all labels, leading to poor precision and inter-class separability. Full fine-tuning improves classification of distinct diseases, while linear probing detects overlapping features. We demonstrate visual understanding of the model using Grad-CAM heatmaps and compare with 15 annotations by a radiologist.

Smith", "Sewoong Oh"], "title": "Sampling from Your Language Model One Byte at a Time", "comment": "23 pages, 8 figures", "summary": "Tokenization is used almost universally by modern language models, enabling efficient text representation using multi-byte or multi-character tokens. However, prior work has shown that tokenization can introduce distortion into the model's generations. For example, users are often advised not to end their prompts with a space because it prevents the model from including the space as part of the next token. This Prompt Boundary Problem (PBP) also arises in languages such as Chinese and in code generation, where tokens often do not line up with syntactic boundaries. Additionally mismatching tokenizers often hinder model composition and interoperability. For example, it is not possible to directly ensemble models with different tokenizers due to their mismatching vocabularies. To address these issues, we present an inference-time method to convert any autoregressive LM with a BPE tokenizer into a character-level or byte-level LM, without changing its generative distribution at the text level. Our method efficient solves the PBP and is also able to unify the vocabularies of language models with different tokenizers, allowing one to ensemble LMs with different tokenizers at inference time as well as transfer the post-training from one model to another using proxy-tuning. We demonstrate in experiments that the ensemble and proxy-tuned models outperform their constituents on downstream evals.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u4efb\u4f55\u4f7f\u7528BPE\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5b57\u7b26\u7ea7\u6216\u5b57\u8282\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u5f15\u5165\u7684Prompt Boundary Problem\uff08PBP\uff09\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u666e\u904d\u4f7f\u7528\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\uff0c\u4f46\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u5931\u771f\uff08\u5982PBP\u95ee\u9898\uff09\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\uff08\u5982\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u96c6\u6210\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06BPE\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5b57\u7b26\u7ea7\u6216\u5b57\u8282\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u53d8\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86PBP\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u548c\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u548c\u4ee3\u7406\u8c03\u4f18\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Therefore, we use distance and reward margin to quantify these differences, and combine them to get Distance Calibrated Reward Margin (DCRM), a metric that measures the quality of a response pair for PO. Intuitively, DCRM encourages minimal noisy differences and maximal desired differences. With this, we study 3 types of commonly used preference datasets, classified along two axes: the source of the responses and the preference labeling function. We establish a general correlation between higher DCRM of the training set and better learning outcome. Inspired by this, we propose a best-of-$N^2$ pairing method that selects response pairs with the highest DCRM.

While existing approaches primarily focus on social interactions between pedestrians, they often overlook the rich environmental context that significantly shapes human movement patterns. In this paper, we propose SceneAware, a novel framework that explicitly incorporates scene understanding to enhance trajectory prediction accuracy. Our method leverages a Vision Transformer~(ViT) scene encoder to process environmental context from static scene images, while Multi-modal Large Language Models~(MLLMs) generate binary walkability masks that distinguish between accessible and restricted areas during training. We combine a Transformer-based trajectory encoder with the ViT-based scene encoder, capturing both temporal dynamics and spatial constraints. The framework integrates collision penalty mechanisms that discourage predicted trajectories from violating physical boundaries, ensuring physically plausible predictions. SceneAware is implemented in both deterministic and stochastic variants. Comprehensive experiments on the ETH/UCY benchmark datasets show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with more than 50\\% improvement over previous models. Our analysis based on different trajectory categories shows that the model performs consistently well across various types of pedestrian movement. This highlights the importance of using explicit scene information and shows that our scene-aware approach is both effective and reliable in generating accurate and physically plausible predictions.

However, their potential for video generation remains under-explored. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{VideoMAR}, a concise and efficient decoder-only autoregressive image-to-video model with continuous tokens, composing temporal frame-by-frame and spatial masked generation. We first identify temporal causality and spatial bi-directionality as the first principle of video AR models, and propose the next-frame diffusion loss for the integration of mask and video generation. Besides, the huge cost and difficulty of long sequence autoregressive modeling is a basic but crucial issue. To this end, we propose the temporal short-to-long curriculum learning and spatial progressive resolution training, and employ progressive temperature strategy at inference time to mitigate the accumulation error.

Evaluating this bias is challenging, as conventional direct-query methods are susceptible to social desirability effects and fail to capture its subtle, multi-dimensional nature. To this end, we propose an evaluation framework that leverages the Stereotype Content Model (SCM) to reconceptualize bias as a multi-dimensional failure in ToM across Competence, Sociability, and Morality. The framework introduces two indirect tasks: the Word Association Bias Test (WABT) to assess implicit lexical associations and the Affective Attribution Test (AAT) to measure covert affective leanings, both designed to probe latent stereotypes without triggering model avoidance. Extensive experiments on 8 State-of-the-Art LLMs demonstrate our framework's capacity to reveal complex bias structures, including pervasive sociability bias, multi-dimensional divergence, and asymmetric stereotype amplification, thereby providing a more robust methodology for identifying the structural nature of implicit bias.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\u5185\u5bb9\u6a21\u578b\uff08SCM\uff09\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u95f4\u63a5\u4efb\u52a1\uff08WABT\u548cAAT\uff09\u63ed\u793aLLMs\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u9690\u6027\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u76f4\u63a5\u67e5\u8be2\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u9690\u6027\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u6027\u548c\u9690\u853d\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528SCM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1WABT\uff08\u8bcd\u6c47\u8054\u60f3\u504f\u89c1\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff09\u548cAAT\uff08\u60c5\u611f\u5f52\u56e0\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff09\u95f4\u63a5\u8bc4\u4f30\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "result": "\u57288\u4e2a\u5148\u8fdbLLMs\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u666e\u904d\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u6027\u504f\u89c1\u3001\u591a\u7ef4\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\u653e\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u8bc6\u522b\u9690\u6027\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, current studies have limitations in modality selection, feature extraction and fusion, and co-inference for decision making, which restrict further improvement in the accuracy, applicability and reliability of multimodal fusion models. To address this problem, this study proposes a Multi-stage Augmented Multimodal Interaction Network (MAINet) for quantifying fish feeding intensity. Firstly, a general feature extraction framework is proposed to efficiently extract feature information from input image, audio and water wave datas. Second, an Auxiliary-modality Reinforcement Primary-modality Mechanism (ARPM) is designed for inter-modal interaction and generate enhanced features, which consists of a Channel Attention Fusion Network (CAFN) and a Dual-mode Attention Fusion Network (DAFN). Finally, an Evidence Reasoning (ER) rule is introduced to fuse the output results of each modality and make decisions, thereby completing the quantification of fish feeding intensity. The experimental results show that the constructed MAINet reaches 96.76%, 96.78%, 96.79% and 96.79% in accuracy, precision, recall and F1-Score respectively, and its performance is significantly higher than the comparison models. Compared with models that adopt single-modality, dual-modality fusion and different decision-making fusion methods, it also has obvious advantages.

We also show that by using label smoothing, we are in fact optimizing a regularized pairwise ranking loss. This result, in turn, provides a new view of training reward models, which links generative models and discriminative models under the same class of training objectives. The outcome of these techniques is a foundation reward model, which can be applied to a wide range of tasks with little or no further fine-tuning effort.

Despite deep models have made significant advances in capturing the discriminative long-term dependency of surgical videos to achieve improved recognition, they rarely account for exploring and modeling the uncertainty in surgical videos, which should be crucial for reliable online surgical phase recognition. We categorize the sources of uncertainty into two types, frame ambiguity in videos and unbalanced distribution among surgical phases, which are inevitable in surgical videos. To address this pivot issue, we introduce a meta-learning-optimized classification diffusion model (Meta-SurDiff), to take full advantage of the deep generative model and meta-learning in achieving precise frame-level distribution estimation for reliable online surgical phase recognition. For coarse recognition caused by ambiguous video frames, we employ a classification diffusion model to assess the confidence of recognition results at a finer-grained frame-level instance. For coarse recognition caused by unbalanced phase distribution, we use a meta-learning based objective to learn the diffusion model, thus enhancing the robustness of classification boundaries for different surgical phases.We establish effectiveness of Meta-SurDiff in online surgical phase recognition through extensive experiments on five widely used datasets using more than four practical metrics. The datasets include Cholec80, AutoLaparo, M2Cai16, OphNet, and NurViD, where OphNet comes from ophthalmic surgeries, NurViD is the daily care dataset, while the others come from laparoscopic surgeries.

Existing human-object interaction (HOI) detection methods mainly focus on the third-person perspectives, overlooking a more intuitive way from the egocentric view of HOI, namely Ego-HOI. This paper introduces an Ego-HOIBench, a new dataset to promote the benchmarking and development of Ego-HOI detection. Our Ego-HOIBench comprises more than 27K egocentric images with high-quality hand-verb-object triplet annotations across 123 fine-grained interaction categories and locations, covering a rich diversity of scenarios, object types, and hand configurations in daily activities. In addition, we explore and adapt third-person HOI detection methods to Ego-HOIBench and illustrate the challenges of hand-occluded objects and the complexity of single- and two-hand interactions. To build a new baseline, we propose a Hand Geometry and Interactivity Refinement (HGIR) scheme, which leverages hand pose and geometric information as valuable cues for interpreting interactions. Specifically, the HGIR scheme explicitly extracts global hand geometric features from the estimated hand pose proposals and refines the interaction-specific features using pose-interaction attention. This scheme enables the model to obtain a robust and powerful interaction representation, significantly improving the Ego-HOI detection capability. Our approach is lightweight and effective, and it can be easily applied to HOI baselines in a plug-and-play manner to achieve state-of-the-art results on Ego-HOIBench.

To address this, we propose Hierarchical Gaussian Splatting (HRGS), a memory-efficient framework with hierarchical block-level optimization. First, we generate a global, coarse Gaussian representation from low-resolution data. Then, we partition the scene into multiple blocks, refining each block with high-resolution data. The partitioning involves two steps: Gaussian partitioning, where irregular scenes are normalized into a bounded cubic space with a uniform grid for task distribution, and training data partitioning, where only relevant observations are retained for each block. By guiding block refinement with the coarse Gaussian prior, we ensure seamless Gaussian fusion across adjacent blocks. To reduce computational demands, we introduce Importance-Driven Gaussian Pruning (IDGP), which computes importance scores for each Gaussian and removes those with minimal contribution, speeding up convergence and reducing memory usage. Additionally, we incorporate normal priors from a pretrained model to enhance surface reconstruction quality. Our method enables high-quality, high-resolution 3D scene reconstruction even under memory constraints.

The paper proposes UniSpace-3D, which innovatively introduces a unified representation space for 3DVG, effectively bridging the gap between visual and textual features. Specifically, UniSpace-3D incorporates three innovative designs: i) a unified representation encoder that leverages the pre-trained CLIP model to map visual and textual features into a unified representation space, effectively bridging the gap between the two modalities; ii) a multi-modal contrastive learning module that further reduces the modality gap; iii) a language-guided query selection module that utilizes the positional and semantic information to identify object candidate points aligned with textual descriptions.

(2) What makes the challenge unique is inherent perturbed terms by semantic paraphasia, which are not exactly related to the target item, hindering the identification process. To address each, we propose robustifying the model from semantically paraphasic errors and enhancing the model with unseen terms with gradient-based selective augmentation. Specifically, the gradient value controls augmented data quality amid semantic errors, while the gradient variance guides the inclusion of unseen but relevant terms.

Yet, prevailing methodologies relying on handcrafted feature extraction face dual challenges: (1) Inconsistent point cloud density, induced by ego-motion dynamics and environmental disturbances during repeated traversals, leads to descriptor instability, and (2) Representation fragility stems from reliance on single-level geometric abstractions that lack discriminative power in structurally complex scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that redefines 3D place recognition through density-agnostic geometric reasoning. Specifically, we introduce an implicit 3D representation based on elastic points, which is immune to the interference of original scene point cloud density and achieves the characteristic of uniform distribution. Subsequently, we derive the occupancy grid and normal vector information of the scene from this implicit representation. Finally, with the aid of these two types of information, we obtain descriptors that fuse geometric information from both bird's-eye view (capturing macro-level spatial layouts) and 3D segment (encoding micro-scale surface geometries) perspectives. We conducted extensive experiments on numerous datasets (KITTI, KITTI-360, MulRan, NCLT) across diverse environments. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Leveraging information asymmetry, AgentSynth constructs subtasks that are simple during generation but significantly more challenging when composed into long-horizon tasks, enabling the creation of over 6,000 diverse and realistic tasks. Our pipeline begins with an LLM-based task proposer guided by a persona, followed by an execution agent that completes the task and logs the trajectory. This process is repeated iteratively to form a sequence of subtasks, which are then summarized by a separate agent into a composite task of controllable difficulty. A key strength of AgentSynth is its ability to precisely modulate task complexity by varying the number of subtasks. Empirical evaluations show that state-of-the-art LLM agents suffer a steep performance drop, from 18% success at difficulty level 1 to just 4% at level 6, highlighting the benchmark's difficulty and discriminative power.

Automating the key task of visual bridge inspection, classification of defects and building components on pixel level, improves efficiency, increases accuracy and enhances safety in the inspection process and resulting building assessment. Models overtaking this task must cope with an assortment of real-world conditions. They must be robust to variations in image quality, as well as background texture, as defects often appear on surfaces of diverse texture and degree of weathering. dacl10k is the largest and most diverse dataset for real-world concrete bridge inspections. However, the dataset exhibits class imbalance, which leads to notably poor model performance particularly when segmenting fine-grained classes such as cracks and cavities. This work introduces \"synth-dacl\", a compilation of three novel dataset extensions based on synthetic concrete textures. These extensions are designed to balance class distribution in dacl10k and enhance model performance, especially for crack and cavity segmentation. When incorporating the synth-dacl extensions, we observe substantial improvements in model robustness across 15 perturbed test sets.

While models have become proficient at detecting explicit patterns, which typically appear in texts as single remarks referred to as utterances, such as social media posts, malicious actors have shifted toward utilizing implicit influential verbal patterns embedded within conversations. These verbal patterns aim to mentally penetrate the victim's mind in order to influence them, enabling the actor to obtain the desired information through implicit means. This paper presents an improved approach for detecting such implicit influential patterns. Furthermore, the proposed model is capable of identifying the specific locations of these influential elements within a conversation. To achieve this, the existing dataset was augmented using the reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art language models. Our designed framework resulted in a 6% improvement in the detection of implicit influential patterns in conversations.

Inspired by recent developments in non-contrastive Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), this paper provides an initial exploration into training a generalizable feature extractor for cell images using such methods. However, there are two major challenges: 1) There is a large difference between the distributions of cell images and natural images, causing the view-generation process in existing SSL methods to fail; and 2) Unlike typical scenarios where each representation is based on a single image, cell profiling often involves multiple input images, making it difficult to effectively combine all available information. To overcome these challenges, we propose SSLProfiler, a non-contrastive SSL framework specifically designed for cell profiling. We introduce specialized data augmentation and representation post-processing methods tailored to cell images, which effectively address the issues mentioned above and result in a robust feature extractor.

For example in TRC, we need to understand the temporal semantic differences between the following two questions that are lexically near-identical: \"What finished right before the decision?\" or \"What finished right after the decision?\". To discern the two questions, existing solutions have relied on answer overlaps as a proxy label to contrast similar and dissimilar questions. However, we claim that answer overlap can lead to unreliable results, due to spurious overlaps of two dissimilar questions with coincidentally identical answers. To address the issue, we propose a novel approach that elicits proper reasoning behaviors through a module for predicting time spans of events. We introduce the Timeline Reasoning Network (TRN) operating in a two-step inductive reasoning process: In the first step model initially answers each question with semantic and syntactic information. The next step chains multiple questions on the same event to predict a timeline, which is then used to ground the answers.

This makes 360 scene understanding tasks, eg, segmentation and tracking, crucial for appications, such as autonomous driving, robotics. With the recent emergence of foundation models, the community is, however, impeded by the lack of large-scale, labelled real-world datasets. This is caused by the inherent spherical properties, eg, severe distortion in polar regions, and content discontinuities, rendering the annotation costly yet complex. This paper introduces Leader360V, the first large-scale, labeled real-world 360 video datasets for instance segmentation and tracking. Our datasets enjoy high scene diversity, ranging from indoor and urban settings to natural and dynamic outdoor scenes. To automate annotation, we design an automatic labeling pipeline, which subtly coordinates pre-trained 2D segmentors and large language models to facilitate the labeling. The pipeline operates in three novel stages. Specifically, in the Initial Annotation Phase, we introduce a Semantic- and Distortion-aware Refinement module, which combines object mask proposals from multiple 2D segmentors with LLM-verified semantic labels. These are then converted into mask prompts to guide SAM2 in generating distortion-aware masks for subsequent frames. In the Auto-Refine Annotation Phase, missing or incomplete regions are corrected either by applying the SDR again or resolving the discontinuities near the horizontal borders.

In contrast, expert problem solvers - such as Olympiad or programming contest teams - leverage a rich tapestry of experiences: absorbing mentorship from coaches, developing intuition from past problems, leveraging knowledge of tool usage and library functionality, adapting strategies based on the expertise and experiences of peers, continuously refining their reasoning through trial and error, and learning from other related problems even during competition. We introduce Xolver, a training-free multi-agent reasoning framework that equips a black-box LLM with a persistent, evolving memory of holistic experience. Xolver integrates diverse experience modalities, including external and self-retrieval, tool use, collaborative interactions, agent-driven evaluation, and iterative refinement. By learning from relevant strategies, code fragments, and abstract reasoning patterns at inference time, Xolver avoids generating solutions from scratch - marking a transition from isolated inference toward experience-aware language agents. Built on both open-weight and proprietary models, Xolver consistently outperforms specialized reasoning agents. Even with lightweight backbones (e.g., QWQ-32B), it often surpasses advanced models including Qwen3-235B, Gemini 2.5 Pro, o3, and o4-mini-high. With o3-mini-high, it achieves new best results on GSM8K (98.1%), AIME'24 (94.4%), AIME'25 (93.7%), Math-500 (99.8%), and LiveCodeBench-V5 (91.6%) - highlighting holistic experience learning as a key step toward generalist agents capable of expert-level reasoning.

At inference time, we use the pointwise map corresponding to the current functional map as guidance during the diffusion process.

We begin by constructing prior token embeddings for each tool based on the tool's name or description, which are used to initialize and regularize the learnable tool token embeddings. This ensures the learned embeddings are well-aligned with the word token space, improving tool call accuracy. We evaluate the method on tasks such as numerical reasoning, knowledge-based question answering, and embodied plan generation using GSM8K-XL, FuncQA, KAMEL, and VirtualHome datasets. The results demonstrate clear improvements over recent baselines, including CoT, REACT, ICL, and ToolkenGPT, indicating that our approach effectively augments LLMs with tools through relevant tokens across diverse domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u4ee4\u724c\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5de5\u5177\u4ee4\u724c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u8bcd\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u6570\u503c\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u8ba1\u5212\u751f\u6210\uff09\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u8003\u8651\u5de5\u5177\u4ee4\u724c\u4e0e\u8bcd\u4ee4\u724c\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5de5\u5177\u540d\u79f0\u6216\u63cf\u8ff0\u6784\u5efa\u5148\u9a8c\u4ee4\u724c\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u548c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u4ee4\u724c\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5176\u4e0e\u8bcd\u4ee4\u724c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5728GSM8K-XL\u3001FuncQA\u3001KAMEL\u548cVirtualHome\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6570\u503c\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u95ee\u7b54\u548c\u8ba1\u5212\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982CoT\u3001REACT\u7b49\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u5173\u4ee4\u724c\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u9886\u57df\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Existing approaches face three key challenges: 1) Excessive pre-training cost arising from multi-stage pre-training pipelines, 2) Ineffective spatial-temporal encoding due to manually split 3D rotary positional embeddings that hinder feature interactions, and 3) Imprecise learning objectives in soft-label multi-instance retrieval, which neglect negative pair correlations. In this paper, we introduce EVA02-AT, a suite of EVA02-based video-language foundation models tailored to egocentric video understanding tasks. EVA02-AT first efficiently transfers an image-based CLIP model into a unified video encoder via a single-stage pretraining. Second, instead of applying rotary positional embeddings to isolated dimensions, we introduce spatial-temporal rotary positional embeddings along with joint attention, which can effectively encode both spatial and temporal information on the entire hidden dimension. This joint encoding of spatial-temporal features enables the model to learn cross-axis relationships, which are crucial for accurately modeling motion and interaction in videos. Third, focusing on multi-instance video-language retrieval tasks, we introduce the Symmetric Multi-Similarity (SMS) loss and a novel training framework that advances all soft labels for both positive and negative pairs, providing a more precise learning objective. Extensive experiments on Ego4D, EPIC-Kitchens-100, and Charades-Ego under zero-shot and fine-tuning settings demonstrate that EVA02-AT achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse egocentric video-language tasks with fewer parameters. Models with our SMS loss also show significant performance gains on multi-instance retrieval benchmarks.

However, these agents often generate short-sighted responses that fail to sustain user guidance and meet expectations. Although preference optimization has proven effective in aligning LLMs with user expectations, it remains costly and performs poorly in multi-turn dialogue. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel multi-turn preference optimization (MTPO) paradigm ECPO, which leverages Expectation Confirmation Theory to explicitly model the evolution of user satisfaction throughout multi-turn dialogues, uncovering the underlying causes of dissatisfaction. These causes can be utilized to support targeted optimization of unsatisfactory responses, thereby achieving turn-level preference optimization.

While having multiple reference summaries is known to improve correlation with human judgments, the impact of using different reference sets on reference-based metrics has not been systematically investigated. This work examines the sensitivity of widely used reference-based metrics in relation to the choice of reference sets, analyzing three diverse multi-reference summarization datasets: SummEval, GUMSum, and DUC2004. We demonstrate that many popular metrics exhibit significant instability. This instability is particularly concerning for n-gram-based metrics like ROUGE, where model rankings vary depending on the reference sets, undermining the reliability of model comparisons. We also collect human judgments on LLM outputs for genre-diverse data and examine their correlation with metrics to supplement existing findings beyond newswire summaries, finding weak-to-no correlation.

In recent years, advancements in artificial intelligence have spurred the development of automatic remote sensing semantic segmentation methods. However, the existing semantic segmentation methods focus on distinguishing spectral characteristics of different objects while ignoring the differences in the elevation of the different targets. This results in land cover misclassification in complex scenarios involving shadow occlusion and spectral confusion. In this paper, we introduce a depth prompting two-dimensional (2D) remote sensing semantic segmentation framework (DepthSeg). It automatically models depth/height information from 2D remote sensing images and integrates it into the semantic segmentation framework to mitigate the effects of spectral confusion and shadow occlusion. During the feature extraction phase of DepthSeg, we introduce a lightweight adapter to enable cost-effective fine-tuning of the large-parameter vision transformer encoder pre-trained by natural images. In the depth prompting phase, we propose a depth prompter to model depth/height features explicitly.

Typically, the inner product performed in the Euclidean space calculates the algebraic\n  similarity rather than the semantic similarity, which results in undesired attention output and a decrease in fusion performance.\n  While the balance of low-level details and high-level semantics should be considered in infrared and visible image fusion task. To\n  address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel attention mechanism based on Grassmann manifold for infrared and visible\n  image fusion (GrFormer). Specifically, our method constructs a low-rank subspace mapping through projection constraints on the\n  Grassmann manifold, compressing attention features into subspaces of varying rank levels. This forces the features to decouple into\n  high-frequency details (local low-rank) and low-frequency semantics (global low-rank), thereby achieving multi-scale semantic\n  fusion. Additionally, to effectively integrate the significant information, we develop a cross-modal fusion strategy (CMS) based on\n  a covariance mask to maximise the complementary properties between different modalities and to suppress the features with high\n  correlation, which are deemed redundant.

Diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful tool for this task, combining DDIM inversion with conditional generation via classifier-free guidance (CFG). However, standard CFG applies a single global weight across all conditioning variables, which can lead to poor identity preservation and spurious attribute changes - a phenomenon known as attribute amplification. To address this, we propose Decoupled Classifier-Free Guidance (DCFG), a flexible and model-agnostic framework that introduces group-wise conditioning control. DCFG builds on an attribute-split embedding strategy that disentangles semantic inputs, enabling selective guidance on user-defined attribute groups. For counterfactual generation, we partition attributes into intervened and invariant sets based on a causal graph and apply distinct guidance to each.

The benchmark consists of manually curated sentence-negation pairs and a multiple-choice dataset that enables in-depth evaluation of models' negation understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "Thunder-NUBench\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53e5\u5b50\u7ea7\u5426\u5b9a\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u8868\u9762\u7ebf\u7d22\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u591a\u79cd\u5426\u5b9a\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u5e38\u5c06\u5426\u5b9a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6b21\u8981\u4efb\u52a1\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u5426\u5b9a\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u624b\u52a8\u6784\u5efa\u53e5\u5b50-\u5426\u5b9a\u5bf9\u548c\u591a\u9009\u9898\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u5426\u5b9a\u4e0e\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u5982\u5c40\u90e8\u5426\u5b9a\u3001\u77db\u76fe\u3001\u6539\u5199\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Thunder-NUBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5426\u5b9a\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "conclusion": "Thunder-NUBench\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u5426\u5b9a\u7406\u89e3\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Edits affecting causally dependent attributes risk generating unrealistic or misleading outcomes if these relationships are ignored. In this work, we propose a causally faithful framework for counterfactual video generation, guided by a vision-language model (VLM). Our method is agnostic to the underlying video editing system and does not require access to its internal mechanisms or finetuning. Instead, we guide the generation by optimizing text prompts based on an assumed causal graph, addressing the challenge of latent space control in LDMs. We evaluate our approach using standard video quality metrics and counterfactual-specific criteria, such as causal effectiveness and minimality. Our results demonstrate that causally faithful video counterfactuals can be effectively generated within the learned distribution of LDMs through prompt-based causal steering.

By systematically analyzing both single-attribute imbalance and compositional attribute imbalance, we reveal how the rarity of attributes affects model performance. To tackle these challenges, we propose adjusting the sampling probability of samples based on the rarity of their compositional attributes.

Existing benchmarks primarily assess static knowledge, while intelligence also entails the ability to rapidly learn from experience. To this end, we advocate for the evaluation of Test-time Learning, the capacity to improve performance in experience-based, reasoning-intensive tasks during test time. In this work, we propose semantic games as effective testbeds for evaluating test-time learning, due to their resistance to saturation and inherent demand for strategic reasoning. We introduce an objective evaluation framework that compares model performance under both limited and cumulative experience settings, and contains four forms of experience representation. To provide a comparative baseline, we recruit eight human participants to complete the same task. Results show that LLMs exhibit measurable test-time learning capabilities; however, their improvements are less stable under cumulative experience and progress more slowly than those observed in humans.

In this work, we propose MoTE, a scalable and memory-efficient approach to train Mixture-of-Ternary-Experts models from dense checkpoint. Instead of training fewer high-precision experts, we propose to train more low-precision experts during up-cycling. Specifically, we use the pre-trained FFN as a shared expert and train ternary routed experts with parameters in {-1, 0, 1}. Extensive experiments show that our approach has promising scaling trend along model size. MoTE achieves comparable performance to full-precision baseline MoE-LLaVA while offering lower memory footprint. Furthermore, our approach is compatible with post-training quantization methods and the advantage further amplifies when memory-constraint goes lower.

Verifying whether a specific LLM was trained on particular data instances or an entire dataset is extremely challenging. Dataset watermarking addresses this by embedding identifiable modifications in training data to detect unauthorized use. However, existing methods often lack stealth, making them relatively easy to detect and remove. In light of these limitations, we propose LexiMark, a novel watermarking technique designed for text and documents, which embeds synonym substitutions for carefully selected high-entropy words. Our method aims to enhance an LLM's memorization capabilities on the watermarked text without altering the semantic integrity of the text. As a result, the watermark is difficult to detect, blending seamlessly into the text with no visible markers, and is resistant to removal due to its subtle, contextually appropriate substitutions that evade automated and manual detection. We evaluated our method using baseline datasets from recent studies and seven open-source models: LLaMA-1 7B, LLaMA-3 8B, Mistral 7B, Pythia 6.9B, as well as three smaller variants from the Pythia family (160M, 410M, and 1B).

We introduce a novel method enhancing knowledge distillation with integrated gradients (IG) as a data augmentation strategy. Our approach overlays IG maps onto input images during training, providing student models with deeper insights into teacher models' decision-making processes. Extensive evaluation on CIFAR-10 demonstrates that our IG-augmented knowledge distillation achieves 92.6% testing accuracy with a 4.1x compression factor-a significant 1.1 percentage point improvement ($p<0.001$) over non-distilled models (91.5%). This compression reduces inference time from 140 ms to 13 ms. Our method precomputes IG maps before training, transforming substantial runtime costs into a one-time preprocessing step. Our comprehensive experiments include: (1) comparisons with attention transfer, revealing complementary benefits when combined with our approach; (2) Monte Carlo simulations confirming statistical robustness; (3) systematic evaluation of compression factor versus accuracy trade-offs across a wide range (2.2x-1122x); and (4) validation on an ImageNet subset aligned with CIFAR-10 classes, demonstrating generalisability beyond the initial dataset.

Attackers can exploit this by inducing excessive output, leading to resource exhaustion and service degradation. Prior energy-latency attacks aim to increase generation time by broadly shifting the output token distribution away from the EOS token, but they neglect the influence of token-level Part-of-Speech (POS) characteristics on EOS and sentence-level structural patterns on output counts, limiting their efficacy. To address this, we propose LingoLoop, an attack designed to induce MLLMs to generate excessively verbose and repetitive sequences. First, we find that the POS tag of a token strongly affects the likelihood of generating an EOS token. Based on this insight, we propose a POS-Aware Delay Mechanism to postpone EOS token generation by adjusting attention weights guided by POS information. Second, we identify that constraining output diversity to induce repetitive loops is effective for sustained generation. We introduce a Generative Path Pruning Mechanism that limits the magnitude of hidden states, encouraging the model to produce persistent loops. Extensive experiments demonstrate LingoLoop can increase generated tokens by up to 30 times and energy consumption by a comparable factor on models like Qwen2.5-VL-3B, consistently driving MLLMs towards their maximum generation limits. These findings expose significant MLLMs' vulnerabilities, posing challenges for their reliable deployment.

In this study, we fine-tune a lightweight 3B parameter vision-language model for Radiological VQA, demonstrating that small models, when appropriately tuned with curated data, can achieve robust performance across both open- and closed-ended questions. We propose a cost-effective training pipeline from synthetic question-answer pair generation to multi-stage fine-tuning on specialised radiological domain-targeted datasets (e.g., ROCO v2.0, MedPix v2.0). Our results show that despite operating at a fraction of the scale of state-of-the-art models such as LLaVA-Med, our model achieves promising performance given its small parameter size and the limited scale of training data.

We first introduce an omnidirectional panoramas dataset featuring a comprehensive suite of reliability-scored annotations. Specifically, our dataset contains 160K panoramas with 5M dense entity-level captions, 1M unique referring expressions, and 100K entity-grounded panoramic scene descriptions. Compared to multi-view alternatives, panoramas can provide more complete, compact, and continuous scene representations through equirectangular projections (ERP). However, the use of ERP introduces two key challenges for MLLMs: i) spatial continuity along the circle of latitude, and ii) latitude-dependent variation in information density. We address these challenges through ERP-RoPE, a position encoding scheme specifically designed for panoramic ERP.

Our approach is guided by Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HT-SR) theory, which analyzes the empirical spectral density (ESD) of weight correlation matrices to quantify \"heavy-tailedness.\" Modules exhibiting more pronounced heavy-tailed ESDs, reflecting stronger feature learning, are assigned weaker decay, while modules with lighter-tailed spectra receive stronger decay. Our method leverages tailored weight decay assignments to balance the module-wise differences in spectral properties, leading to improved performance.

To overcome these challenges, we introduce a modular generation framework, GenerationPrograms, inspired by recent advancements in executable \"code agent\" architectures. Unlike conventional generation methods that simultaneously generate outputs and attributions or rely on post-hoc attribution, GenerationPrograms decomposes the process into two distinct stages: first, creating an executable program plan composed of modular text operations (such as paraphrasing, compression, and fusion) explicitly tailored to the query, and second, executing these operations following the program's specified instructions to produce the final response. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that GenerationPrograms significantly improves attribution quality at both the document level and sentence level across two long-form question-answering tasks and a multi-document summarization task. We further demonstrate that GenerationPrograms can effectively function as a post-hoc attribution method, outperforming traditional techniques in recovering accurate attributions.

Speech, as a natural and intuitive modality, offers a promising alternative. Real-world speech inputs, however, often suffer from transcription errors due to accents, background noise, and varying speech rates, limiting the applicability of existing 3DVG methods. To address these challenges, we propose \\textbf{SpeechRefer}, a novel 3DVG framework designed to enhance performance in the presence of noisy and ambiguous speech-to-text transcriptions. SpeechRefer integrates seamlessly with xisting 3DVG models and introduces two key innovations. First, the Speech Complementary Module captures acoustic similarities between phonetically related words and highlights subtle distinctions, generating complementary proposal scores from the speech signal.

A particularly challenging class of this transpilation problem is translating between complex- (CISC) and reduced- (RISC) hardware architectures, due to fundamental differences in instruction complexity, memory models, and execution paradigms. In this work, we introduce GG (Guaranteed Guess), an ISA-centric transpilation pipeline that combines the translation power of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) with the rigor of established software testing constructs. Our method generates candidate translations using an LLM from one ISA to another, and embeds such translations within a software-testing framework to build quantifiable confidence in the translation. We evaluate our GG approach over two diverse datasets, enforce high code coverage (>98%) across unit tests, and achieve functional/semantic correctness of 99% on HumanEval programs and 49% on BringupBench programs, respectively. Further, we compare our approach to the state-of-the-art Rosetta 2 framework on Apple Silicon, showcasing 1.73x faster runtime performance, 1.47x better energy efficiency, and 2.41x better memory usage for our transpiled code, demonstrating the effectiveness of GG for real-world CISC-to-RISC translation tasks.

Most existing methods depend on hand-crafted features, key frames like onset, apex, and offset frames, or deep networks limited by small-scale and low-diversity datasets. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end micro-action-aware deep learning framework with advantages from transformer, graph convolution, and vanilla convolution. In particular, we propose a novel F5C block composed of fully-connected convolution and channel correspondence convolution to directly extract local-global features from a sequence of raw frames, without the prior knowledge of key frames. The transformer-style fully-connected convolution is proposed to extract local features while maintaining global receptive fields, and the graph-style channel correspondence convolution is introduced to model the correlations among feature patterns. Moreover, MER, optical flow estimation, and facial landmark detection are jointly trained by sharing the local-global features. The two latter tasks contribute to capturing facial subtle action information for MER, which can alleviate the impact of insufficient training data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework (i) outperforms the state-of-the-art MER methods on CASME II, SAMM, and SMIC benchmarks, (ii) works well for optical flow estimation and facial landmark detection, and (iii) can capture facial subtle muscle actions in local regions associated with MEs.

Our aggregation mechanism fuses continuous moral acceptability scores (beyond binary labels) into a collective probability, weighting contributions by model reliability.

Addressing the core challenge of autonomous UAV landing in complex and unknown environments, this study innovatively leverages the depth-normal synergy prediction capabilities of the Metric3D V2 model to construct an end-to-end safe landing zones (SLZ) estimation framework. By introducing a safe zone segmentation branch, we transform the landing zone estimation task into a binary semantic segmentation problem. The model is fine-tuned and annotated using the WildUAV dataset from a UAV perspective, while a cross-domain evaluation dataset is constructed to validate the model's robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that VisLanding significantly enhances the accuracy of safe zone identification through a depth-normal joint optimization mechanism, while retaining the zero-shot generalization advantages of Metric3D V2. The proposed method exhibits superior generalization and robustness in cross-domain testing compared to other approaches.

Due to their linguistic capacities, it is possible that LLMs are an efficient alternative to time-consuming manual coding and the pre-training of supervised machine learning models. As most existing research on this topic has focused on English-language responses relating to non-complex topics or on single LLMs, it is unclear whether its findings generalize and how the quality of these classifications compares to established methods. In this study, we investigate to what extent different LLMs can be used to code open-ended survey responses in other contexts, using German data on reasons for survey participation as an example. We compare several state-of-the-art LLMs and several prompting approaches, and evaluate the LLMs' performance by using human expert codings. Overall performance differs greatly between LLMs, and only a fine-tuned LLM achieves satisfactory levels of predictive performance. Performance differences between prompting approaches are conditional on the LLM used. Finally, LLMs' unequal classification performance across different categories of reasons for survey participation results in different categorical distributions when not using fine-tuning. We discuss the implications of these findings, both for methodological research on coding open-ended responses and for their substantive analysis, and for practitioners processing or substantively analyzing such data. Finally, we highlight the many trade-offs researchers need to consider when choosing automated methods for open-ended response classification in the age of LLMs. In doing so, our study contributes to the growing body of research about the conditions under which LLMs can be efficiently, accurately, and reliably leveraged in survey research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4e0d\u540cLLMs\u5728\u5fb7\u8bed\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u8c03\u67e5\u56de\u7b54\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4ec5\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684LLM\u8868\u73b0\u6ee1\u610f\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8LLMs\u5728\u975e\u82f1\u8bed\u3001\u590d\u6742\u4e3b\u9898\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u8c03\u67e5\u56de\u7b54\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5fb7\u8bed\u8c03\u67e5\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u591a\u79cdLLMs\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e13\u5bb6\u4eba\u5de5\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u4e0d\u540cLLMs\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\uff0c\u4ec5\u5fae\u8c03LLM\u8868\u73b0\u6ee1\u610f\uff1b\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u679c\u56e0LLM\u800c\u5f02\uff1b\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u5747\u5bfc\u81f4\u7c7b\u522b\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u6743\u8861\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u8d44\u6e90\uff1b\u4e3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

The background can be specified by natural images (image-based relighting) or generated from unlimited text prompts (text-based relighting). Existing studies primarily focus on image-based relighting, while with scant exploration into text-based scenarios. Some works employ intricate disentanglement pipeline designs relying on environment maps to provide relevant information, which grapples with the expensive data cost required for intrinsic decomposition and light source. Other methods take this task as an image translation problem and perform pixel-level transformation with autoencoder architecture. While these methods have achieved decent harmonization effects, they struggle to generate realistic and natural light interaction effects between the foreground and background. To alleviate these challenges, we reorganize the input data into a unified format and leverage the semantic prior provided by the pretrained diffusion model to facilitate the generation of natural results.

This study explores the extent to which fine-tuned LLMs can replicate and amplify polarizing discourse within online environments. Using a curated dataset of politically charged discussions extracted from Reddit, we fine-tune an open-source LLM to produce context-aware and ideologically aligned responses. The model's outputs are evaluated through linguistic analysis, sentiment scoring, and human annotation, with particular attention to credibility and rhetorical alignment with the original discourse. The results indicate that, when trained on partisan data, LLMs are capable of producing highly plausible and provocative comments, often indistinguishable from those written by humans.

Recent machine learning methods have improved risk estimation (i.e., predicting the likelihood of disease progression) and predictive modelling (i.e., the forecasting of future outcomes based on current data) using medical images, but clinical adoption remains limited due to their lack of interpretability. Existing approaches that generate future images for risk estimation are complex and impractical. Additionally, previous methods fail to localize anatomical knee landmarks, limiting interpretability. We address these gaps with a new interpretable machine learning method to estimate the risk of knee OA progression via multi-task predictive modelling that classifies future knee OA severity and predicts anatomical knee landmarks from efficiently generated high-quality future images. Such image generation is achieved by leveraging a diffusion model in a class-conditioned latent space to forecast disease progression, offering a visual representation of how particular health conditions may evolve.

However, their performance is limited by the small number of trainable parameters. Recent work combines LoRA with the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), i.e., LoRA-MoE, to enhance capacity, but two limitations remain in hindering the full exploitation of its potential: 1) the influence of downstream tasks when assigning expert numbers, and 2) the uniform rank assignment across all LoRA experts, which restricts representational diversity. To mitigate these gaps, we propose GuiLoMo, a fine-grained layer-wise expert numbers and ranks allocation strategy with GuidedSelection Vectors (GSVs). GSVs are learned via a prior bilevel optimization process to capture both model- and task-specific needs, and are then used to allocate optimal expert numbers and ranks. Experiments on three backbone models across diverse benchmarks show that GuiLoMo consistently achieves superior or comparable performance to all baselines. Further analysis offers key insights into how expert numbers and ranks vary across layers and tasks, highlighting the benefits of adaptive expert configuration.

We trained a wide range of base models on a variety of datasets including code generation, mathematical reasoning, and general-domain tasks, resulting in 1,000+ SFT models under controlled conditions. We then identified the dataset properties that matter most and examined the layer-wise modifications introduced by SFT. Our findings reveal that some training-task synergies persist across all models while others vary substantially, emphasizing the importance of model-specific strategies. Moreover, we demonstrate that perplexity consistently predicts SFT effectiveness--often surpassing superficial similarity between trained data and benchmark--and that mid-layer weight changes correlate most strongly with performance gains.

As a result, they often produce implausible poses under joint occlusions or rapid motion changes. To address these challenges, we propose the PoseGRAF framework. We first construct a dual graph convolutional structure that separately processes joint and bone graphs, effectively capturing their local dependencies. A Cross-Attention module is then introduced to model interdependencies between bone directions and joint features. Building upon this, a dynamic fusion module is designed to adaptively integrate both feature types by leveraging the relational dependencies between joints and bones. An improved Transformer encoder is further incorporated in a residual manner to generate the final output. Experimental results on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets show that our method exceeds state-of-the-art approaches.

Large general-purpose models are trained for many tasks, but work best on high-frequency use cases. After training, it is hard to adapt a model to perform well on specific use cases underrepresented in the training corpus. Relying on prompt engineering or few-shot examples to maximize the output quality on a particular test case can be frustrating, as models can be highly sensitive to small changes, react in unpredicted ways or rely on a fixed system prompt for maintaining performance. In this work, we ask: \"Can we optimize our training protocols to both improve controllability and performance on underrepresented use cases at inference time?\" We revisit the divide between training and inference techniques to improve long-tail performance while providing users with a set of control levers the model is trained to be responsive to. We create a detailed taxonomy of data characteristics and task provenance to explicitly control generation attributes and implicitly condition generations at inference time. We fine-tune a base model to infer these markers automatically, which makes them optional at inference time. This principled and flexible approach yields pronounced improvements in performance, especially on examples from the long tail of the training distribution. While we observe an average lift of 5.7% win rates in open-ended generation quality with our markers, we see over 9.1% gains in underrepresented domains.

Consistency models can distill these models into efficient one-step generators; however, unlike flow- and diffusion-based methods, their performance inevitably degrades when increasing the number of steps, which we show both analytically and empirically. Flow maps generalize these approaches by connecting any two noise levels in a single step and remain effective across all step counts. In this paper, we introduce two new continuous-time objectives for training flow maps, along with additional novel training techniques, generalizing existing consistency and flow matching objectives. We further demonstrate that autoguidance can improve performance, using a low-quality model for guidance during distillation, and an additional boost can be achieved by adversarial finetuning, with minimal loss in sample diversity. We extensively validate our flow map models, called Align Your Flow, on challenging image generation benchmarks and achieve state-of-the-art few-step generation performance on both ImageNet 64x64 and 512x512, using small and efficient neural networks.

In contrast to traditional approaches -- which typically assume full knowledge of the forward model or access to paired degraded and ground-truth images -- the proposed method operates under minimal assumptions and relies only on small, unpaired datasets. This makes it particularly well-suited for real-world scenarios, where the forward model is often unknown or misspecified, and collecting paired data is costly or infeasible. The method leverages conditional flow matching to model the distribution of degraded observations, while simultaneously learning the forward model via a distribution-matching loss that arises naturally from the framework. Empirically, it outperforms both single-image blind and unsupervised approaches on deblurring and non-uniform point spread function (PSF) calibration tasks. It also matches state-of-the-art performance on blind super-resolution. We also showcase the effectiveness of our method with a proof of concept for lens calibration: a real-world application traditionally requiring time-consuming experiments and specialized equipment.

Second, we empirically demonstrate that selecting distillation checkpoints based on entropy loss for RL training, rather than validation metrics, yields superior performance-efficiency trade-offs in subsequent RL training.

While recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3DGS methods increasingly incorporate dedicated compression modules, there is a lack of a comprehensive framework to evaluate their perceptual impact. Therefore we present 3DGS-IEval-15K, the first large-scale image quality assessment (IQA) dataset specifically designed for compressed 3DGS representations. Our dataset encompasses 15,200 images rendered from 10 real-world scenes through 6 representative 3DGS algorithms at 20 strategically selected viewpoints, with different compression levels leading to various distortion effects. Through controlled subjective experiments, we collect human perception data from 60 viewers. We validate dataset quality through scene diversity and MOS distribution analysis, and establish a comprehensive benchmark with 30 representative IQA metrics covering diverse types. As the largest-scale 3DGS quality assessment dataset to date, our work provides a foundation for developing 3DGS specialized IQA metrics, and offers essential data for investigating view-dependent quality distribution patterns unique to 3DGS.

Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) and similar schemes split text once, build a static vocabulary, and leave the model stuck with that choice. We relax this rigidity by introducing an autoregressive U-Net that learns to embed its own tokens as it trains. The network reads raw bytes, pools them into words, then pairs of words, then up to 4 words, giving it a multi-scale view of the sequence. At deeper stages, the model must predict further into the future -- anticipating the next few words rather than the next byte -- so deeper stages focus on broader semantic patterns while earlier stages handle fine details. When carefully tuning and controlling pretraining compute, shallow hierarchies tie strong BPE baselines, and deeper hierarchies have a promising trend.

However, since speech is continuous and complex, it is often discretized for autoregressive modeling. Speech tokens derived from self-supervised models (known as semantic tokens) typically focus on the linguistic aspects of speech but neglect prosodic information. As a result, models trained on these tokens can generate speech with reduced naturalness. Existing approaches try to fix this by adding pitch features to the semantic tokens. However, pitch alone cannot fully represent the range of paralinguistic attributes, and selecting the right features requires careful hand-engineering. To overcome this, we propose an end-to-end variational approach that automatically learns to encode these continuous speech attributes to enhance the semantic tokens. Our approach eliminates the need for manual extraction and selection of paralinguistic features. Moreover, it produces preferred speech continuations according to human raters.

The rise of large vision-language models (LVLMs) has enabled a rethinking of geo-localization as a reasoning-driven task grounded in visual cues. However, two major challenges persist. On the data side, existing reasoning-focused datasets are primarily based on street-view imagery, offering limited scene diversity and constrained viewpoints. On the modeling side, current approaches predominantly rely on supervised fine-tuning, which yields only marginal improvements in reasoning capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose a novel pipeline that constructs a reasoning-oriented geo-localization dataset, MP16-Reason, using diverse social media images.

In this paper, we revisit the classical coarse-to-fine design of FocalClick and introduce significant extensions. Inspired by its multi-stage strategy, we propose a novel pipeline, FocalClick-XL, to address these challenges simultaneously. Following the emerging trend of large-scale pretraining, we decompose interactive segmentation into meta-tasks that capture different levels of information -- context, object, and detail -- assigning a dedicated subnet to each level.This decomposition allows each subnet to undergo scaled pretraining with independent data and supervision, maximizing its effectiveness. To enhance flexibility, we share context- and detail-level information across different interaction forms as common knowledge while introducing a prompting layer at the object level to encode specific interaction types. As a result, FocalClick-XL achieves state-of-the-art performance on click-based benchmarks and demonstrates remarkable adaptability to diverse interaction formats, including boxes, scribbles, and coarse masks. Beyond binary mask generation, it is also capable of predicting alpha mattes with fine-grained details, making it a versatile and powerful tool for interactive segmentation.", "AI": {"tldr": "FocalClick-XL\u6269\u5c55\u4e86FocalClick\u7684\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7ea7\u5b50\u7f51\u5206\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f62\u5f0f\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u7ec6\u8282\u6355\u6349\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u652f\u6301\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f62\u5f0f\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFocalClick-XL\uff0c\u5206\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3001\u5bf9\u8c61\u548c\u7ec6\u8282\u4e09\u7ea7\u5b50\u7f51\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u793a\u5c42\u7f16\u7801\u4ea4\u4e92\u7c7b\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u70b9\u51fb\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u79cd\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f62\u5f0f\uff08\u5982\u6846\u3001\u6d82\u9e26\uff09\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u7ec6alpha\u906e\u7f69\u3002", "conclusion": "FocalClick-XL\u662f\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u5206\u5272\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f62\u5f0f\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u7ec6\u8282\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

Although existing methods have made progress in cross-modal interaction, low-light conditions, and model lightweight, there are still challenges like the lack of a unified single-stage framework, difficulty in balancing performance and fusion strategy, and unreasonable modality weight allocation. To address these, based on the YOLOv11 framework, we present YOLOv11-RGBT, a new comprehensive multimodal object detection framework. We designed six multispectral fusion modes and successfully applied them to models from YOLOv3 to YOLOv12 and RT-DETR. After reevaluating the importance of the two modalities, we proposed a P3 mid-fusion strategy and multispectral controllable fine-tuning (MCF) strategy for multispectral models. These improvements optimize feature fusion, reduce redundancy and mismatches, and boost overall model performance. Experiments show our framework excels on three major open-source multispectral object detection datasets, like LLVIP and FLIR. Particularly, the multispectral controllable fine-tuning strategy significantly enhanced model adaptability and robustness. On the FLIR dataset, it consistently improved YOLOv11 models' mAP by 3.41%-5.65%, reaching a maximum of 47.61%, verifying the framework and strategies' effectiveness.

The fusion of camera and LiDAR data addresses the limitations of individual sensors but relies on precise extrinsic calibration. Recently, numerous end-to-end calibration methods have been proposed; however, most predict extrinsic parameters in a single step and lack iterative optimization capabilities. To address the increasing demand for higher accuracy, we propose a versatile iterative framework based on surrogate diffusion. This framework can enhance the performance of any calibration method without requiring architectural modifications. Specifically, the initial extrinsic parameters undergo iterative refinement through a denoising process, in which the original calibration method serves as a surrogate denoiser to estimate the final extrinsics at each step. For comparative analysis, we selected four state-of-the-art calibration methods as surrogate denoisers and compared the results of our diffusion process with those of two other iterative approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that when integrated with our diffusion model, all calibration methods achieve higher accuracy, improved robustness, and greater stability compared to other iterative techniques and their single-step counterparts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u66ff\u4ee3\u6269\u6563\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u76f8\u673a\u4e0eLiDAR\u5916\u53c2\u6807\u5b9a\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u539f\u65b9\u6cd5\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6807\u5b9a\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4e3a\u5355\u6b65\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u66ff\u4ee3\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u521d\u59cb\u5916\u53c2\u8fdb\u884c\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u539f\u6807\u5b9a\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u66ff\u4ee3\u53bb\u566a\u5668\u9010\u6b65\u4f30\u8ba1\u6700\u7ec8\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u540e\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u6807\u5b9a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u6b65\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u8fed\u4ee3\u6280\u672f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u6807\u5b9a\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

They over-rely on partial cues and generate incorrect responses. Recently, methods like Visual Contrastive Decoding (VCD) and Instruction Contrastive Decoding (ICD) have been proposed to mitigate hallucinations by contrasting predictions from perturbed or negatively prefixed inputs against original outputs. In this work, we uncover that methods like VCD and ICD fundamentally influence internal attention dynamics of the model. This observation suggests that their effectiveness may not stem merely from surface-level modifications to logits but from deeper shifts in attention distribution. Inspired by this insight, we propose an attention-steerable contrastive decoding framework that directly intervenes in attention mechanisms of the model to offer a more principled approach to mitigating hallucinations.

While traditional stereo and active depth sensors have limitations in cost, power, and robustness, dual-pixel (DP) technology, ubiquitous in modern cameras, offers a compelling alternative.

DiFuse-Net features a window bi-directional parallax attention mechanism (WBiPAM) specifically designed to capture the subtle DP disparity cues unique to smartphone cameras with small aperture. A separate encoder extracts contextual information from the RGB image, and these features are fused to enhance depth prediction. We also propose a Cross-modal Transfer Learning (CmTL) mechanism to utilize large-scale RGB-D datasets in the literature to cope with the limitations of obtaining large-scale RGB-DP-D dataset.

Characterizing damage over a geographically dynamic and protracted armed conflict requires active monitoring. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has precedence for mapping disaster-induced damage with bi-temporal methods but applications to active monitoring during sustained crises are limited. Using interferometric SAR data from Sentinel-1, we apply a long temporal-arc coherent change detection (LT-CCD) approach to track weekly damage trends over the first year of the 2023- Israel-Hamas War. We detect 92.5% of damage labels in reference data from the United Nations with a negligible (1.2%) false positive rate. The temporal fidelity of our approach reveals rapidly increasing damage during the first three months of the war focused in northern Gaza, a notable pause in damage during a temporary ceasefire, and surges of new damage as conflict hot-spots shift from north to south. Three-fifths (191,263) of all buildings are damaged or destroyed by the end of the study.

A lifelike talking head requires synchronized coordination of subject identity, lip movements, facial expressions, and head poses. The absence of these synchronizations is a fundamental flaw, leading to unrealistic results. To address the critical issue of synchronization, identified as the ''devil'' in creating realistic talking heads, we introduce SyncTalk++, which features a Dynamic Portrait Renderer with Gaussian Splatting to ensure consistent subject identity preservation and a Face-Sync Controller that aligns lip movements with speech while innovatively using a 3D facial blendshape model to reconstruct accurate facial expressions. To ensure natural head movements, we propose a Head-Sync Stabilizer, which optimizes head poses for greater stability. Additionally, SyncTalk++ enhances robustness to out-of-distribution (OOD) audio by incorporating an Expression Generator and a Torso Restorer, which generate speech-matched facial expressions and seamless torso regions. Our approach maintains consistency and continuity in visual details across frames and significantly improves rendering speed and quality, achieving up to 101 frames per second.

Unfortunately, the high fidelity also comes at a high computational cost due the inherently sequential generative process. In this work, we seek to optimally balance quality and computational cost, and propose a framework to allow the amount of computation to vary for each prompt, depending on its complexity. Each prompt is automatically routed to the most appropriate text-to-image generation function, which may correspond to a distinct number of denoising steps of a diffusion model, or a disparate, independent text-to-image model. Unlike uniform cost reduction techniques (e.g., distillation, model quantization), our approach achieves the optimal trade-off by learning to reserve expensive choices (e.g., 100+ denoising steps) only for a few complex prompts, and employ more economical choices (e.g., small distilled model) for less sophisticated prompts.

To fully exploit this information, it is essential to pretrain EO Foundation Models (FMs) on large unlabeled datasets, enabling efficient fine-tuning for several different downstream tasks with minimal labeled data. In this work, we present the scaling-up of our recently proposed EO Foundation Model, PhilEO Geo-Aware U-Net, on the unlabeled 23TB dataset MajorTOM, which covers the vast majority of the Earth's surface, as well as on the specialized subset FastTOM 2TB that does not include oceans and ice. We develop and study various PhilEO model variants with different numbers of parameters and architectures. Finally, we fine-tune the models on the PhilEO Bench for road density estimation, building density pixel-wise regression, and land cover semantic segmentation, and we evaluate the performance. Our results demonstrate that for all n-shots for road density regression, the PhilEO 44M MajorTOM 23TB model outperforms PhilEO Globe 0.5TB 44M. We also show that for most n-shots for road density estimation and building density regression, PhilEO 200M FastTOM outperforms all the other models. The effectiveness of both dataset and model scaling is validated using the PhilEO Bench. We also study the impact of architecture scaling, transitioning from U-Net Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to Vision Transformers (ViT).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684EO\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578bPhilEO\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u5730\u7403\u89c2\u6d4b\u536b\u661f\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6d77\u91cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55PhilEO Geo-Aware U-Net\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u572823TB\u7684MajorTOM\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c2TB\u7684FastTOM\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u53d8\u4f53\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPhilEO 44M MajorTOM 23TB\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9053\u8def\u5bc6\u5ea6\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u800cPhilEO 200M FastTOM\u5728\u591a\u6570\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u4eceU-Net CNN\u5230ViT\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002"}}

However, in practical applications, hardware limitations often degrade data quality, while real-time constraints restrict model inference to instantaneous state and scene observations. These limitations seriously reduce the efficacy of learning from expert demonstrations, resulting in failures in object localization, grasp planning, and long-horizon task execution. To address these challenges, we propose Causal Diffusion Policy (CDP), a novel transformer-based diffusion model that enhances action prediction by conditioning on historical action sequences, thereby enabling more coherent and context-aware visuomotor policy learning. To further mitigate the computational cost associated with autoregressive inference, a caching mechanism is also introduced to store attention key-value pairs from previous timesteps, substantially reducing redundant computations during execution. Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments, spanning diverse 2D and 3D manipulation tasks, demonstrate that CDP uniquely leverages historical action sequences to achieve significantly higher accuracy than existing methods. Moreover, even when faced with degraded input observation quality, CDP maintains remarkable precision by reasoning through temporal continuity, which highlights its practical robustness for robotic control under realistic, imperfect conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "CDP\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5386\u53f2\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e8f\u5217\u548c\u7f13\u5b58\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u8f93\u5165\u3002", "motivation": "\u786c\u4ef6\u9650\u5236\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u7ea6\u675f\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\u5931\u8d25\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578bCDP\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5386\u53f2\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e8f\u5217\u548c\u7f13\u5b58\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0cCDP\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u65f6\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "CDP\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}
