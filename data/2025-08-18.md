### [1] [Privacy Enhancement for Gaze Data Using a Noise-Infused Autoencoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10918)
*Samantha Aziz,Oleg Komogortsev*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于潜在噪声自编码器的隐私增强机制，保护用户视线数据隐私，同时保持数据可用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视线数据在跨会话中被重新识别的隐私问题，同时确保数据仍可用于良性任务。

Method: 使用潜在噪声自编码器对视线信号进行处理，平衡隐私与实用性。

Result: 显著降低生物识别可能性，同时实用性损失最小，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该机制为视线数据隐私保护提供了有效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: We present a privacy-enhancing mechanism for gaze signals using a
latent-noise autoencoder that prevents users from being re-identified across
play sessions without their consent, while retaining the usability of the data
for benign tasks. We evaluate privacy-utility trade-offs across biometric
identification and gaze prediction tasks, showing that our approach
significantly reduces biometric identifiability with minimal utility
degradation. Unlike prior methods in this direction, our framework retains
physiologically plausible gaze patterns suitable for downstream use, which
produces favorable privacy-utility trade-off. This work advances privacy in
gaze-based systems by providing a usable and effective mechanism for protecting
sensitive gaze data.

*Jianlong Wu,Wei Liu,Ye Liu,Meng Liu,Liqiang Nie,Zhouchen Lin,Chang Wen Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文综述了基于多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的视频时间定位（VTG）研究，通过三维分类法系统分析了当前研究，并总结了实证结果和未来方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补VTG-MLLMs领域全面综述的空白，推动视频时间定位技术的发展。

Method: 采用三维分类法：1）MLLMs的功能角色；2）训练范式；3）视频特征处理技术。

Result: 总结了当前研究的实证结果，并提出了未来研究方向。

Conclusion: VTG-MLLMs在性能和多任务泛化方面表现优异，但仍存在局限性，需进一步探索。

Abstract: The recent advancement in video temporal grounding (VTG) has significantly
enhanced fine-grained video understanding, primarily driven by multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). With superior multimodal comprehension and reasoning
abilities, VTG approaches based on MLLMs (VTG-MLLMs) are gradually surpassing
traditional fine-tuned methods. They not only achieve competitive performance
but also excel in generalization across zero-shot, multi-task, and multi-domain
settings. Despite extensive surveys on general video-language understanding,
comprehensive reviews specifically addressing VTG-MLLMs remain scarce. To fill
this gap, this survey systematically examines current research on VTG-MLLMs
through a three-dimensional taxonomy: 1) the functional roles of MLLMs,
highlighting their architectural significance; 2) training paradigms, analyzing
strategies for temporal reasoning and task adaptation; and 3) video feature
processing techniques, which determine spatiotemporal representation
effectiveness. We further discuss benchmark datasets, evaluation protocols, and
summarize empirical findings. Finally, we identify existing limitations and
propose promising research directions. For additional resources and details,

### [3] [VSF: Simple, Efficient, and Effective Negative Guidance in Few-Step Image Generation Models By \underline{V}alue \underline{S}ign \underline{F}lip](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10931)
*Wenqi Guo,Shan Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VSF是一种通过翻转负提示的注意力值符号来动态抑制不需要内容的方法，适用于少步扩散和流匹配图像生成模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如CFG、NASA、NAG）在负提示引导方面存在不足，VSF旨在高效解决这一问题。

Method: 通过翻转负提示的注意力值符号，动态抑制不需要的内容，计算开销小，兼容多种架构。

Result: 在复杂提示对的数据集上验证，VSF在静态图像和视频生成任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: VSF显著提升了负提示的遵循能力，同时保持图像质量，适用于少步和非少步模型。

Abstract: We introduce Value Sign Flip (VSF), a simple and efficient method for
incorporating negative prompt guidance in few-step diffusion and flow-matching
image generation models. Unlike existing approaches such as classifier-free
guidance (CFG), NASA, and NAG, VSF dynamically suppresses undesired content by
flipping the sign of attention values from negative prompts. Our method
requires only small computational overhead and integrates effectively with
MMDiT-style architectures such as Stable Diffusion 3.5 Turbo, as well as
cross-attention-based models like Wan. We validate VSF on challenging datasets
with complex prompt pairs and demonstrate superior performance in both static
image and video generation tasks. Experimental results show that VSF
significantly improves negative prompt adherence compared to prior methods in
few-step models, and even CFG in non-few-step models, while maintaining
competitive image quality. Code and ComfyUI node are available in

### [4] [ViPE: Video Pose Engine for 3D Geometric Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10934)
*Jiahui Huang,Qunjie Zhou,Hesam Rabeti,Aleksandr Korovko,Huan Ling,Xuanchi Ren,Tianchang Shen,Jun Gao,Dmitry Slepichev,Chen-Hsuan Lin,Jiawei Ren,Kevin Xie,Joydeep Biswas,Laura Leal-Taixe,Sanja Fidler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViPE是一种高效视频处理引擎，用于从无约束视频中估计相机参数和深度图，性能优于现有基线，并用于标注大规模视频数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从野外视频中获取一致且精确的3D注释的挑战，以支持空间AI系统的发展。

Method: ViPE通过估计相机内参、相机运动和密集深度图，适用于多种场景和相机模型。

Result: 在TUM/KITTI序列上性能提升18%/50%，处理速度为3-5FPS，并标注了包含96M帧的大规模数据集。

Conclusion: ViPE及其标注数据集的开源有望加速空间AI系统的开发。

Abstract: Accurate 3D geometric perception is an important prerequisite for a wide
range of spatial AI systems. While state-of-the-art methods depend on
large-scale training data, acquiring consistent and precise 3D annotations from
in-the-wild videos remains a key challenge. In this work, we introduce ViPE, a
handy and versatile video processing engine designed to bridge this gap. ViPE
efficiently estimates camera intrinsics, camera motion, and dense, near-metric
depth maps from unconstrained raw videos. It is robust to diverse scenarios,
including dynamic selfie videos, cinematic shots, or dashcams, and supports
various camera models such as pinhole, wide-angle, and 360{\deg} panoramas. We
have benchmarked ViPE on multiple benchmarks. Notably, it outperforms existing
uncalibrated pose estimation baselines by 18%/50% on TUM/KITTI sequences, and
runs at 3-5FPS on a single GPU for standard input resolutions. We use ViPE to
annotate a large-scale collection of videos. This collection includes around
100K real-world internet videos, 1M high-quality AI-generated videos, and 2K
panoramic videos, totaling approximately 96M frames -- all annotated with
accurate camera poses and dense depth maps. We open-source ViPE and the
annotated dataset with the hope of accelerating the development of spatial AI
systems.

### [5] [Relative Pose Regression with Pose Auto-Encoders: Enhancing Accuracy and Data Efficiency for Retail Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10933)
*Yoli Shavit,Yosi Keller*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于相机姿态自动编码器（PAE）的相对姿态回归（RPR）方法，用于改进绝对姿态回归（APR）的定位精度，无需额外存储图像或姿态数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代零售环境中，精确的相机定位对提升客户体验、优化库存管理和实现自主操作至关重要。现有APR方法虽有效，但结合视觉和空间场景先验的方法通常精度更高。

Method: 扩展PAE至RPR任务，提出一种新的重定位方案，利用PAE-based RPR优化APR预测，无需额外数据存储。

Result: 实验表明，PAE-based RPR优于同等架构的图像RPR模型，且在室内基准测试中显著提升APR定位精度，仅需30%数据即可达到竞争性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过PAE-based RPR优化APR，显著减少零售部署中的数据收集负担，同时保持高精度。

Abstract: Accurate camera localization is crucial for modern retail environments,
enabling enhanced customer experiences, streamlined inventory management, and
autonomous operations. While Absolute Pose Regression (APR) from a single image
offers a promising solution, approaches that incorporate visual and spatial
scene priors tend to achieve higher accuracy. Camera Pose Auto-Encoders (PAEs)
have recently been introduced to embed such priors into APR. In this work, we
extend PAEs to the task of Relative Pose Regression (RPR) and propose a novel
re-localization scheme that refines APR predictions using PAE-based RPR,
without requiring additional storage of images or pose data. We first introduce
PAE-based RPR and establish its effectiveness by comparing it with image-based
RPR models of equivalent architectures. We then demonstrate that our refinement
strategy, driven by a PAE-based RPR, enhances APR localization accuracy on
indoor benchmarks. Notably, our method is shown to achieve competitive
performance even when trained with only 30% of the data, substantially reducing
the data collection burden for retail deployment. Our code and pre-trained
models are available at: https://github.com/yolish/camera-pose-auto-encoders

### [6] [HQ-OV3D: A High Box Quality Open-World 3D Detection Framework based on Diffision Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10935)
*Qi Liu,Yabei Li,Hongsong Wang,Lei He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HQ-OV3D框架通过跨模态几何一致性和基于DDIM的去噪机制，生成高质量伪标签，显著提升开放词汇3D检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统封闭式3D检测无法满足开放世界应用需求，现有开放词汇方法忽视几何质量。

Method: 提出IMCV提案生成器和ACA去噪器，利用几何一致性和标注类先验优化伪标签。

Result: 在新型类别上mAP提升7.37%，伪标签质量显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HQ-OV3D可作为独立检测器或插件，提升开放词汇检测流程的伪标签质量。

Abstract: Traditional closed-set 3D detection frameworks fail to meet the demands of
open-world applications like autonomous driving. Existing open-vocabulary 3D
detection methods typically adopt a two-stage pipeline consisting of
pseudo-label generation followed by semantic alignment. While vision-language
models (VLMs) recently have dramatically improved the semantic accuracy of
pseudo-labels, their geometric quality, particularly bounding box precision,
remains commonly neglected.To address this issue, we propose a High Box Quality
Open-Vocabulary 3D Detection (HQ-OV3D) framework, dedicated to generate and
refine high-quality pseudo-labels for open-vocabulary classes. The framework
comprises two key components: an Intra-Modality Cross-Validated (IMCV) Proposal
Generator that utilizes cross-modality geometric consistency to generate
high-quality initial 3D proposals, and an Annotated-Class Assisted (ACA)
Denoiser that progressively refines 3D proposals by leveraging geometric priors
from annotated categories through a DDIM-based denoising mechanism.Compared to
the state-of-the-art method, training with pseudo-labels generated by our
approach achieves a 7.37% improvement in mAP on novel classes, demonstrating
the superior quality of the pseudo-labels produced by our framework. HQ-OV3D
can serve not only as a strong standalone open-vocabulary 3D detector but also
as a plug-in high-quality pseudo-label generator for existing open-vocabulary
detection or annotation pipelines.

### [7] [Vision-Only Gaussian Splatting for Collaborative Semantic Occupancy Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10936)
*Cheng Chen,Hao Huang,Saurabh Bagchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于稀疏3D语义高斯泼溅的协作3D语义占用预测方法，解决了现有方法的高通信成本或依赖深度估计的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉方法在3D语义占用预测中依赖密集3D体素或2D平面特征，导致高通信成本或额外监督需求，限制了协作场景的适用性。

Method: 通过共享和融合中间高斯基元，实现跨代理融合、几何与语义联合编码及稀疏消息传递。

Result: 在mIoU和IoU指标上分别优于单代理和基线协作方法，通信量减少时仍保持性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在协作感知中高效且鲁棒，适用于通信受限的场景。

Abstract: Collaborative perception enables connected vehicles to share information,
overcoming occlusions and extending the limited sensing range inherent in
single-agent (non-collaborative) systems. Existing vision-only methods for 3D
semantic occupancy prediction commonly rely on dense 3D voxels, which incur
high communication costs, or 2D planar features, which require accurate depth
estimation or additional supervision, limiting their applicability to
collaborative scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose the first
approach leveraging sparse 3D semantic Gaussian splatting for collaborative 3D
semantic occupancy prediction. By sharing and fusing intermediate Gaussian
primitives, our method provides three benefits: a neighborhood-based
cross-agent fusion that removes duplicates and suppresses noisy or inconsistent
Gaussians; a joint encoding of geometry and semantics in each primitive, which
reduces reliance on depth supervision and allows simple rigid alignment; and
sparse, object-centric messages that preserve structural information while
reducing communication volume. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach outperforms single-agent perception and baseline collaborative methods
by +8.42 and +3.28 points in mIoU, and +5.11 and +22.41 points in IoU,
respectively. When further reducing the number of transmitted Gaussians, our
method still achieves a +1.9 improvement in mIoU, using only 34.6%
communication volume, highlighting robust performance under limited
communication budgets.

### [8] [Personalized Face Super-Resolution with Identity Decoupling and Fitting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10937)
*Jiarui Yang,Hang Guo,Wen Huang,Tao Dai,Shutao Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的面部超分辨率方法IDFSR，通过身份解耦和拟合，解决了极端退化场景下身份信息丢失和幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在极端退化（如8倍以上缩放）下难以恢复真实且身份一致的面部图像，容易产生幻觉效果。

Method: IDFSR采用三种设计：1）掩蔽低分辨率图像中的面部区域；2）对齐参考图像提供风格指导；3）利用真实图像的ID嵌入进行细粒度建模。通过扩散模型解耦风格和身份，并进行轻量级微调。

Result: 实验表明，IDFSR在极端退化场景下显著优于现有方法，尤其在身份一致性上表现优异。

Conclusion: IDFSR通过身份解耦和拟合，有效提升了极端退化下的面部超分辨率质量。

Abstract: In recent years, face super-resolution (FSR) methods have achieved remarkable
progress, generally maintaining high image fidelity and identity (ID)
consistency under standard settings. However, in extreme degradation scenarios
(e.g., scale $> 8\times$), critical attributes and ID information are often
severely lost in the input image, making it difficult for conventional models
to reconstruct realistic and ID-consistent faces. Existing methods tend to
generate hallucinated faces under such conditions, producing restored images
lacking authentic ID constraints. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
FSR method with Identity Decoupling and Fitting (IDFSR), designed to enhance ID
restoration under large scaling factors while mitigating hallucination effects.
Our approach involves three key designs: 1) \textbf{Masking} the facial region
in the low-resolution (LR) image to eliminate unreliable ID cues; 2)
\textbf{Warping} a reference image to align with the LR input, providing style
guidance; 3) Leveraging \textbf{ID embeddings} extracted from ground truth (GT)
images for fine-grained ID modeling and personalized adaptation. We first
pretrain a diffusion-based model to explicitly decouple style and ID by forcing
it to reconstruct masked LR face regions using both style and identity
embeddings. Subsequently, we freeze most network parameters and perform
lightweight fine-tuning of the ID embedding using a small set of target ID
images. This embedding encodes fine-grained facial attributes and precise ID
information, significantly improving both ID consistency and perceptual
quality. Extensive quantitative evaluations and visual comparisons demonstrate
that the proposed IDFSR substantially outperforms existing approaches under
extreme degradation, particularly achieving superior performance on ID
consistency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统木材分类方法耗时且依赖专家知识，需自动化解决方案以支持生态监测和森林管理。

Method: 构建自定义图像数据集，评估五种卷积神经网络架构（ResNet50、EfficientNet等）。

Result: ShuffleNetV2表现最佳，平均准确率99.29%，F1分数99.35%。

Conclusion: 轻量级深度学习模型适用于资源受限环境，为木材分类和生态评估提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate identification of wood species plays a critical role in ecological
monitoring, biodiversity conservation, and sustainable forest management.
Traditional classification approaches relying on macroscopic and microscopic
inspection are labor-intensive and require expert knowledge. In this study, we
explore the application of deep learning to automate the classification of ten
wood species commonly found in Vietnam. A custom image dataset was constructed
from field-collected wood samples, and five state-of-the-art convolutional
neural network architectures--ResNet50, EfficientNet, MobileViT, MobileNetV3,
and ShuffleNetV2--were evaluated. Among these, ShuffleNetV2 achieved the best
balance between classification performance and computational efficiency, with
an average accuracy of 99.29\% and F1-score of 99.35\% over 20 independent
runs. These results demonstrate the potential of lightweight deep learning
models for real-time, high-accuracy species identification in
resource-constrained environments. Our work contributes to the growing field of
ecological informatics by providing scalable, image-based solutions for
automated wood classification and forest biodiversity assessment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升卷积神经网络在图像分类任务中的特征表达能力和鲁棒性。

Method: 通过动态调整池化参数并结合ReLU激活函数，实现自适应和非线性特征提取。

Result: 在MNIST Digits、MNIST Fashion和CIFAR-10数据集上，NIRMAL Pooling的测试准确率均优于传统最大池化。

Conclusion: NIRMAL Pooling为图像识别任务提供了一种灵活可靠的池化方法，显著提升了CNN性能。

Abstract: This paper presents NIRMAL Pooling, a novel pooling layer for Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) that integrates adaptive max pooling with non-linear
activation function for image classification tasks. The acronym NIRMAL stands
for Non-linear Activation, Intermediate Aggregation, Reduction, Maximum,
Adaptive, and Localized. By dynamically adjusting pooling parameters based on
desired output dimensions and applying a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)
activation post-pooling, NIRMAL Pooling improves robustness and feature
expressiveness. We evaluated its performance against standard Max Pooling on
three benchmark datasets: MNIST Digits, MNIST Fashion, and CIFAR-10. NIRMAL
Pooling achieves test accuracies of 99.25% (vs. 99.12% for Max Pooling) on
MNIST Digits, 91.59% (vs. 91.44%) on MNIST Fashion, and 70.49% (vs. 68.87%) on
CIFAR-10, demonstrating consistent improvements, particularly on complex
datasets. This work highlights the potential of NIRMAL Pooling to enhance CNN
performance in diverse image recognition tasks, offering a flexible and
reliable alternative to traditional pooling methods.

### [11] [Topological Structure Description for Artcode Detection Using the Shape of Orientation Histogram](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10942)
*Liming Xu,Dave Towey,Andrew P. French,Steve Benford*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文研究了Artcodes的检测问题，提出了一种新的特征描述符（形状方向直方图）来识别拓扑结构，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着智能手机和VR/AR技术的普及，环境中虚拟元素连接的物体增多，识别这些物体是触发后续交互的第一步。Artcodes是一种兼具人类可读性和机器可读性的装饰标记，研究其检测方法具有重要意义。

Method: 提出了一种新的特征描述符——形状方向直方图，用于描述Artcodes的通用拓扑结构，并构建了检测系统进行实验评估。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的特征向量能有效表示拓扑结构，且检测系统在Artcodes识别上表现良好。

Conclusion: 尽管这是基于特征的系统检测拓扑物体的初步尝试，但它为拓扑物体检测的应用和交互机会提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: The increasing ubiquity of smartphones and resurgence of VR/AR techniques, it
is expected that our everyday environment may soon be decorating with objects
connecting with virtual elements. Alerting to the presence of these objects is
therefore the first step for motivating follow-up further inspection and
triggering digital material attached to the objects. This work studies a
special kind of these objects -- Artcodes -- a human-meaningful and
machine-readable decorative markers that camouflage themselves with freeform
appearance by encoding information into their topology. We formulate this
problem of recongising the presence of Artcodes as Artcode proposal detection,
a distinct computer vision task that classifies topologically similar but
geometrically and semantically different objects as a same class. To deal with
this problem, we propose a new feature descriptor, called the shape of
orientation histogram, to describe the generic topological structure of an
Artcode. We collect datasets and conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate
the performance of the Artcode detection proposer built upon this new feature
vector. Our experimental results show the feasibility of the proposed feature
vector for representing topological structures and the effectiveness of the
system for detecting Artcode proposals. Although this work is an initial
attempt to develop a feature-based system for detecting topological objects
like Artcodes, it would open up new interaction opportunities and spark
potential applications of topological object detection.

### [12] [Analysis of the Compaction Behavior of Textile Reinforcements in Low-Resolution In-Situ CT Scans via Machine-Learning and Descriptor-Based Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10943)
*Christian Düreth,Jan Condé-Wolter,Marek Danczak,Karsten Tittmann,Jörn Jaschinski,Andreas Hornig,Maik Gude*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种通过低分辨率CT量化干纺织增强材料中嵌套行为的框架，用于预测复合材料性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解纺织增强复合材料的多尺度结构对预测其机械性能（如刚度、渗透性和损伤容限）至关重要，而嵌套行为是影响这些性能的关键因素。

Method: 研究采用低分辨率CT进行原位压实实验，利用3D-UNet模型对材料进行语义分割，并通过两点相关函数分析空间结构。

Result: 模型在分割任务中表现出色（IoU为0.822，F1分数为0.902），结果与显微图像验证一致，成功提取了平均层厚度和嵌套度。

Conclusion: 该方法为从工业CT数据中提取关键几何特征提供了可靠途径，并为复合材料预成型件的逆向建模和结构分析奠定了基础。

Abstract: A detailed understanding of material structure across multiple scales is
essential for predictive modeling of textile-reinforced composites. Nesting --
characterized by the interlocking of adjacent fabric layers through local
interpenetration and misalignment of yarns -- plays a critical role in defining
mechanical properties such as stiffness, permeability, and damage tolerance.
This study presents a framework to quantify nesting behavior in dry textile
reinforcements under compaction using low-resolution computed tomography (CT).
In-situ compaction experiments were conducted on various stacking
configurations, with CT scans acquired at 20.22 $\mu$m per voxel resolution. A
tailored 3D{-}UNet enabled semantic segmentation of matrix, weft, and fill
phases across compaction stages corresponding to fiber volume contents of
50--60 %. The model achieved a minimum mean Intersection-over-Union of 0.822
and an $F1$ score of 0.902. Spatial structure was subsequently analyzed using
the two-point correlation function $S_2$, allowing for probabilistic extraction
of average layer thickness and nesting degree. The results show strong
agreement with micrograph-based validation. This methodology provides a robust
approach for extracting key geometrical features from industrially relevant CT
data and establishes a foundation for reverse modeling and descriptor-based
structural analysis of composite preforms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 道路坑洼对安全和车辆寿命构成威胁，尤其在印度等道路维护不足的地区，亟需一种高效、低成本的解决方案。

Method: 利用自标注的7,000多帧数据集，基于YOLO模型进行实时坑洼检测，结合OCR模块提取时间戳并与GPS日志同步，最终通过OpenStreetMap可视化数据。

Result: 系统在复杂条件下提高了检测精度，并生成政府兼容的道路评估数据，为道路维护提供实用工具。

Abstract: Potholes on the roads are a serious hazard and maintenance burden. This poses
a significant threat to road safety and vehicle longevity, especially on the
diverse and under-maintained roads of India. In this paper, we present a
complete end-to-end system called iWatchRoad for automated pothole detection,
Global Positioning System (GPS) tagging, and real time mapping using
OpenStreetMap (OSM). We curated a large, self-annotated dataset of over 7,000
frames captured across various road types, lighting conditions, and weather
scenarios unique to Indian environments, leveraging dashcam footage. This
dataset is used to fine-tune, Ultralytics You Only Look Once (YOLO) model to
perform real time pothole detection, while a custom Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) module was employed to extract timestamps directly from video
frames. The timestamps are synchronized with GPS logs to geotag each detected
potholes accurately. The processed data includes the potholes' details and
frames as metadata is stored in a database and visualized via a user friendly
web interface using OSM. iWatchRoad not only improves detection accuracy under
challenging conditions but also provides government compatible outputs for road
assessment and maintenance planning through the metadata visible on the
website. Our solution is cost effective, hardware efficient, and scalable,
offering a practical tool for urban and rural road management in developing
regions, making the system automated. iWatchRoad is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为增量补丁生成（IPG）的方法，能高效生成对抗性补丁，比现有方法快11.1倍，同时保持攻击性能。实验证明IPG生成的补丁能广泛覆盖模型漏洞，并为构建鲁棒模型提供基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗性补丁对AI模型的鲁棒性构成挑战，尤其在计算机视觉任务中。传统对抗样本的局限性促使开发更高效的补丁生成方法。

Method: 提出增量补丁生成（IPG）方法，通过实验和消融研究（如YOLO特征分布可视化和对抗训练）验证其高效性和泛化能力。

Result: IPG生成的补丁效率高且泛化性强，能有效覆盖模型漏洞，并为构建鲁棒模型提供数据支持。

Conclusion: IPG在对抗性补丁防御和实际应用（如自动驾驶、医疗影像）中具有潜力，可提升AI模型在高风险环境中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: The advent of adversarial patches poses a significant challenge to the
robustness of AI models, particularly in the domain of computer vision tasks
such as object detection. In contradistinction to traditional adversarial
examples, these patches target specific regions of an image, resulting in the
malfunction of AI models. This paper proposes Incremental Patch Generation
(IPG), a method that generates adversarial patches up to 11.1 times more
efficiently than existing approaches while maintaining comparable attack
performance. The efficacy of IPG is demonstrated by experiments and ablation
studies including YOLO's feature distribution visualization and adversarial
training results, which show that it produces well-generalized patches that
effectively cover a broader range of model vulnerabilities. Furthermore,
IPG-generated datasets can serve as a robust knowledge foundation for
constructing a robust model, enabling structured representation, advanced
reasoning, and proactive defenses in AI security ecosystems. The findings of
this study suggest that IPG has considerable potential for future utilization
not only in adversarial patch defense but also in real-world applications such
as autonomous vehicles, security systems, and medical imaging, where AI models
must remain resilient to adversarial attacks in dynamic and high-stakes
environments.

TL;DR: 论文提出了ORBIT基准测试，用于评估视觉语言模型在对象属性推理上的能力，发现现有模型在复杂推理和真实图像上表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉问答基准测试在对象属性推理上存在局限性，缺乏多样性和复杂性，需要更系统的评估框架。

Method: 设计了ORBIT基准测试，包含360张图像和1,080个问题，涵盖三种图像类型、三种推理级别和四种对象属性维度。

Result: 12个先进视觉语言模型在零样本设置下表现不佳，最高准确率仅为40%，尤其在真实图像和复杂推理上表现较差。

Conclusion: ORBIT揭示了现有模型的局限性，呼吁开发更可扩展的基准测试方法和更强的推理模型。

Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have made remarkable progress on many
popular visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks, it remains unclear whether
they abstract and reason over depicted objects. Inspired by human object
categorisation, object property reasoning involves identifying and recognising
low-level details and higher-level abstractions. While current VQA benchmarks
consider a limited set of object property attributes like size, they typically
blend perception and reasoning, and lack representativeness in terms of
reasoning and image categories. To this end, we introduce a systematic
evaluation framework with images of three representative types, three reasoning
levels of increasing complexity, and four object property dimensions driven by
prior work on commonsense reasoning. We develop a procedure to instantiate this
benchmark into ORBIT, a multi-level reasoning VQA benchmark for object
properties comprising 360 images paired with a total of 1,080 count-based
questions. Experiments with 12 state-of-the-art VLMs in zero-shot settings
reveal significant limitations compared to humans, with the best-performing
model only reaching 40\% accuracy. VLMs struggle particularly with realistic
(photographic) images, counterfactual reasoning about physical and functional
properties, and higher counts. ORBIT points to the need to develop methods for
scalable benchmarking, generalize annotation guidelines, and explore additional
reasoning VLMs. We make the ORBIT benchmark and the experimental code available
to support such endeavors.

TL;DR: MedAtlas是一个新的医疗AI基准框架，旨在通过多轮对话、多模态图像交互和多任务集成来评估大型语言模型在真实医疗推理任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗多模态基准通常局限于单图像、单任务，无法捕捉临床实践中的多模态交互和纵向特性。

Method: MedAtlas支持四种核心任务，包括多轮问答和多图像联合推理，结合临床文本和多模态图像（如CT、MRI等）。

Result: 基准测试显示现有模型在多阶段临床推理中存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: MedAtlas为开发稳健可信的医疗AI提供了具有挑战性的评估平台。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has demonstrated significant potential in clinical
decision-making; however, developing models capable of adapting to diverse
real-world scenarios and performing complex diagnostic reasoning remains a
major challenge. Existing medical multi-modal benchmarks are typically limited
to single-image, single-turn tasks, lacking multi-modal medical image
integration and failing to capture the longitudinal and multi-modal interactive
nature inherent to clinical practice. To address this gap, we introduce
MedAtlas, a novel benchmark framework designed to evaluate large language
models on realistic medical reasoning tasks. MedAtlas is characterized by four
key features: multi-turn dialogue, multi-modal medical image interaction,
multi-task integration, and high clinical fidelity. It supports four core
tasks: open-ended multi-turn question answering, closed-ended multi-turn
question answering, multi-image joint reasoning, and comprehensive disease
diagnosis. Each case is derived from real diagnostic workflows and incorporates
temporal interactions between textual medical histories and multiple imaging
modalities, including CT, MRI, PET, ultrasound, and X-ray, requiring models to
perform deep integrative reasoning across images and clinical texts. MedAtlas
provides expert-annotated gold standards for all tasks. Furthermore, we propose
two novel evaluation metrics: Round Chain Accuracy and Error Propagation
Resistance. Benchmark results with existing multi-modal models reveal
substantial performance gaps in multi-stage clinical reasoning. MedAtlas
establishes a challenging evaluation platform to advance the development of
robust and trustworthy medical AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从单壳低角度分辨率临床MRI协议中生成可靠FOD的挑战，并推动深度学习在扩散MRI增强中的临床应用。

Method: 采用优化的端到端深度学习框架FastFOD-Net，显著提升FOD估计的性能和效率（比前代快60倍）。

Result: FastFOD-Net在健康对照和多种神经系统疾病中表现出色，能够减少测量误差、降低样本量需求，并提升疾病区分能力。

Conclusion: FastFOD-Net为临床神经科学研究提供了高效工具，增强了扩散MRI分析的可靠性和可解释性，有望推动深度学习在临床中的广泛应用。

Abstract: Fiber orientation distribution (FOD) is an advanced diffusion MRI modeling
technique that represents complex white matter fiber configurations, and a key
step for subsequent brain tractography and connectome analysis. Its reliability
and accuracy, however, heavily rely on the quality of the MRI acquisition and
the subsequent estimation of the FODs at each voxel. Generating reliable FODs
from widely available clinical protocols with single-shell and
low-angular-resolution acquisitions remains challenging but could potentially
be addressed with recent advances in deep learning-based enhancement
techniques. Despite advancements, existing methods have predominantly been
assessed on healthy subjects, which have proved to be a major hurdle for their
clinical adoption. In this work, we validate a newly optimized enhancement
framework, FastFOD-Net, across healthy controls and six neurological disorders.
This accelerated end-to-end deep learning framework enhancing FODs with
superior performance and delivering training/inference efficiency for clinical
use ($60\times$ faster comparing to its predecessor). With the most
comprehensive clinical evaluation to date, our work demonstrates the potential
of FastFOD-Net in accelerating clinical neuroscience research, empowering
diffusion MRI analysis for disease differentiation, improving interpretability
in connectome applications, and reducing measurement errors to lower sample
size requirements. Critically, this work will facilitate the more widespread
adoption of, and build clinical trust in, deep learning based methods for
diffusion MRI enhancement. Specifically, FastFOD-Net enables robust analysis of
real-world, clinical diffusion MRI data, comparable to that achievable with
high-quality research acquisitions.

TL;DR: 研究评估了视觉语言模型（VLMs）在模拟低视力人群视觉感知时的表现，发现结合视力信息和示例图像响应能显著提高模拟准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索VLMs在无障碍领域的模拟能力，特别是低视力人群的视觉感知。

Method: 通过调查40名低视力参与者构建数据集，生成VLM模拟代理，并评估其与原始回答的一致性。

Result: VLMs在仅提供部分信息时表现不佳（一致性0.59），但结合视力信息和示例响应后显著提升（一致性0.70）。

Conclusion: 结合多种信息类型能有效提升VLMs的模拟能力，但额外示例的增益有限。

Abstract: Advances in vision language models (VLMs) have enabled the simulation of
general human behavior through their reasoning and problem solving
capabilities. However, prior research has not investigated such simulation
capabilities in the accessibility domain. In this paper, we evaluate the extent
to which VLMs can simulate the vision perception of low vision individuals when
interpreting images. We first compile a benchmark dataset through a survey
study with 40 low vision participants, collecting their brief and detailed
vision information and both open-ended and multiple-choice image perception and
recognition responses to up to 25 images. Using these responses, we construct
prompts for VLMs (GPT-4o) to create simulated agents of each participant,
varying the included information on vision information and example image
responses. We evaluate the agreement between VLM-generated responses and
participants' original answers. Our results indicate that VLMs tend to infer
beyond the specified vision ability when given minimal prompts, resulting in
low agreement (0.59). The agreement between the agent' and participants'
responses remains low when only either the vision information (0.59) or example
image responses (0.59) are provided, whereas a combination of both
significantly increase the agreement (0.70, p < 0.0001). Notably, a single
example combining both open-ended and multiple-choice responses, offers
significant performance improvements over either alone (p < 0.0001), while
additional examples provided minimal benefits (p > 0.05).

Abstract: By integrating the perception capabilities of multimodal encoders with the
generative power of Large Language Models (LLMs), Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs), exemplified by GPT-4V, have achieved great success in various
multimodal tasks, pointing toward a promising pathway to artificial general
intelligence. Despite this progress, the limited quality of multimodal data,
poor performance on many complex downstream tasks, and inadequate evaluation
protocols continue to hinder the reliability and broader applicability of MLLMs
across diverse domains. Inspired by the human ability to leverage external
tools for enhanced reasoning and problem-solving, augmenting MLLMs with
external tools (e.g., APIs, expert models, and knowledge bases) offers a
promising strategy to overcome these challenges. In this paper, we present a
comprehensive survey on leveraging external tools to enhance MLLM performance.
Our discussion is structured along four key dimensions about external tools:
(1) how they can facilitate the acquisition and annotation of high-quality
multimodal data; (2) how they can assist in improving MLLM performance on
challenging downstream tasks; (3) how they enable comprehensive and accurate
evaluation of MLLMs; (4) the current limitations and future directions of
tool-augmented MLLMs. Through this survey, we aim to underscore the
transformative potential of external tools in advancing MLLM capabilities,
offering a forward-looking perspective on their development and applications.

Motivation: 解决自动驾驶感知系统中因同色异谱现象导致的视觉模糊问题，提升对弱势道路使用者的识别能力。

Method: 提出一种波段选择策略，结合信息论技术和图像质量指标，从高光谱数据中筛选最具信息量的波段。

Result: 实验表明，选定的HSI波段在多个指标上显著优于RGB图像，减少了同色异谱混淆。

Conclusion: 该方法为高级驾驶辅助系统（ADAS）和自动驾驶（AD）提供了更鲁棒的感知输入，有助于提升道路安全。

Abstract: Protecting Vulnerable Road Users (VRU) is a critical safety challenge for
automotive perception systems, particularly under visual ambiguity caused by
metamerism, a phenomenon where distinct materials appear similar in RGB
imagery. This work investigates hyperspectral imaging (HSI) to overcome this
limitation by capturing unique material signatures beyond the visible spectrum,
especially in the Near-Infrared (NIR). To manage the inherent
high-dimensionality of HSI data, we propose a band selection strategy that
integrates information theory techniques (joint mutual information
maximization, correlation analysis) with a novel application of an image
quality metric (contrast signal-to-noise ratio) to identify the most spectrally
informative bands. Using the Hyperspectral City V2 (H-City) dataset, we
identify three informative bands (497 nm, 607 nm, and 895 nm, $\pm$27 nm) and
reconstruct pseudo-color images for comparison with co-registered RGB.
Quantitative results demonstrate increased dissimilarity and perceptual
separability of VRU from the background. The selected HSI bands yield
improvements of 70.24%, 528.46%, 1206.83%, and 246.62% for dissimilarity
(Euclidean, SAM, $T^2$) and perception (CIE $\Delta E$) metrics, consistently
outperforming RGB and confirming a marked reduction in metameric confusion. By
providing a spectrally optimized input, our method enhances VRU separability,
establishing a robust foundation for downstream perception tasks in Advanced
Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Autonomous Driving (AD), ultimately
contributing to improved road safety.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出EVCtrl，一种轻量级控制适配器，通过时空双缓存策略减少冗余计算，提升生成效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ControlNet在视频生成中因冗余计算导致延迟高，需解决这一问题。

Method: 采用时空双缓存策略：空间上分区处理控制信号，时间上跳过不必要的去噪步骤。

Result: 在CogVideo-Controlnet等实验中，速度提升2倍以上，生成质量几乎无损。

Conclusion: EVCtrl无需重新训练模型，即可高效实现图像和视频的精确控制生成。

Abstract: Visual generation includes both image and video generation, training
probabilistic models to create coherent, diverse, and semantically faithful
content from scratch. While early research focused on unconditional sampling,
practitioners now demand controllable generation that allows precise
specification of layout, pose, motion, or style. While ControlNet grants
precise spatial-temporal control, its auxiliary branch markedly increases
latency and introduces redundant computation in both uncontrolled regions and
denoising steps, especially for video. To address this problem, we introduce
EVCtrl, a lightweight, plug-and-play control adapter that slashes overhead
without retraining the model. Specifically, we propose a spatio-temporal dual
caching strategy for sparse control information. For spatial redundancy, we
first profile how each layer of DiT-ControlNet responds to fine-grained
control, then partition the network into global and local functional zones. A
locality-aware cache focuses computation on the local zones that truly need the
control signal, skipping the bulk of redundant computation in global regions.
For temporal redundancy, we selectively omit unnecessary denoising steps to
improve efficiency. Extensive experiments on CogVideo-Controlnet,
Wan2.1-Controlnet, and Flux demonstrate that our method is effective in image
and video control generation without the need for training. For example, it
achieves 2.16 and 2.05 times speedups on CogVideo-Controlnet and
Wan2.1-Controlnet, respectively, with almost no degradation in generation
quality.Codes are available in the supplementary materials.

Motivation: 现有谣言检测方法常忽略图像内容及多尺度上下文与图像的关系，导致关键信息丢失。

Method: 设计SCLIP编码器生成统一语义嵌入，引入跨模态多尺度对齐模块和尺度感知融合网络。

Result: 在两个真实数据集上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MICC方法有效且具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Existing rumor detection methods often neglect the content within images as
well as the inherent relationships between contexts and images across different
visual scales, thereby resulting in the loss of critical information pertinent
to rumor identification. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel
cross-modal rumor detection scheme based on contrastive learning, namely the
Multi-scale Image and Context Correlation exploration algorithm (MICC).
Specifically, we design an SCLIP encoder to generate unified semantic
embeddings for text and multi-scale image patches through contrastive
pretraining, enabling their relevance to be measured via dot-product
similarity. Building upon this, a Cross-Modal Multi-Scale Alignment module is
introduced to identify image regions most relevant to the textual semantics,
guided by mutual information maximization and the information bottleneck
principle, through a Top-K selection strategy based on a cross-modal relevance
matrix constructed between the text and multi-scale image patches. Moreover, a
scale-aware fusion network is designed to integrate the highly correlated
multi-scale image features with global text features by assigning adaptive
weights to image regions based on their semantic importance and cross-modal
relevance. The proposed methodology has been extensively evaluated on two
real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that it achieves a
substantial performance improvement over existing state-of-the-art approaches
in rumor detection, highlighting its effectiveness and potential for practical
applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为IOVQA的新方法，通过整数标签和针对性损失计算机制优化视觉语言模型在视频质量评估任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在视觉内容评估中存在结果不精确和损失计算效率低的问题，限制了模型对关键评估指标的关注。

Method: IOVQA通过约束模型输出为整数范围[10,50]，并使用目标掩码策略（仅计算标签前两位整数的损失）来优化模型。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了模型在VQA任务中的准确性和一致性，在VQualA 2025挑战赛中排名第三。

Conclusion: 整数标签在微调中的有效性为优化视觉语言模型在定量评估场景中提供了新思路。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of vision language models(VLM), their ability to
assess visual content based on specific criteria and dimensions has become
increasingly critical for applications such as video-theme consistency
assessment and visual quality scoring. However, existing methods often suffer
from imprecise results and inefficient loss calculation, which limit the focus
of the model on key evaluation indicators. To address this, we propose
IOVQA(Integer-only VQA), a novel fine-tuning approach tailored for VLMs to
enhance their performance in video quality assessment tasks. The key innovation
of IOVQA lies in its label construction and its targeted loss calculation
mechanism. Specifically, during dataset curation, we constrain the model's
output to integers within the range of [10,50], ensuring numerical stability,
and convert decimal Overall_MOS to integer before using them as labels. We also
introduce a target-mask strategy: when computing the loss, only the first
two-digit-integer of the label is unmasked, forcing the model to learn the
critical components of the numerical evaluation. After fine-tuning the
Qwen2.5-VL model using the constructed dataset, experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the model's
accuracy and consistency in the VQA task, ranking 3rd in VQualA 2025
GenAI-Bench AIGC Video Quality Assessment Challenge -- Track I. Our work
highlights the effectiveness of merely leaving integer labels during
fine-tuning, providing an effective idea for optimizing VLMs in quantitative
evaluation scenarios.

Conclusion: 该数据集为研究者提供了训练和评估VLMs的新基准，推动了建筑安全检查技术的发展。

Abstract: Construction safety inspections typically involve a human inspector
identifying safety concerns on-site. With the rise of powerful Vision Language
Models (VLMs), researchers are exploring their use for tasks such as detecting
safety rule violations from on-site images. However, there is a lack of open
datasets to comprehensively evaluate and further fine-tune VLMs in construction
safety inspection. Current applications of VLMs use small, supervised datasets,
limiting their applicability in tasks they are not directly trained for. In
this paper, we propose the ConstructionSite 10k, featuring 10,000 construction
site images with annotations for three inter-connected tasks, including image
captioning, safety rule violation visual question answering (VQA), and
construction element visual grounding. Our subsequent evaluation of current
state-of-the-art large pre-trained VLMs shows notable generalization abilities
in zero-shot and few-shot settings, while additional training is needed to make
them applicable to actual construction sites. This dataset allows researchers
to train and evaluate their own VLMs with new architectures and techniques,
providing a valuable benchmark for construction safety inspection.

Abstract: Document fraud poses a significant threat to industries reliant on secure and
verifiable documentation, necessitating robust detection mechanisms. This study
investigates the efficacy of state-of-the-art multi-modal large language models
(LLMs)-including OpenAI O1, OpenAI 4o, Gemini Flash (thinking), Deepseek Janus,
Grok, Llama 3.2 and 4, Qwen 2 and 2.5 VL, Mistral Pixtral, and Claude 3.5 and
3.7 Sonnet-in detecting fraudulent documents. We benchmark these models against
each other and prior work on document fraud detection techniques using a
standard dataset with real transactional documents. Through prompt optimization
and detailed analysis of the models' reasoning processes, we evaluate their
ability to identify subtle indicators of fraud, such as tampered text,
misaligned formatting, and inconsistent transactional sums. Our results reveal
that top-performing multi-modal LLMs demonstrate superior zero-shot
generalization, outperforming conventional methods on out-of-distribution
datasets, while several vision LLMs exhibit inconsistent or subpar performance.
Notably, model size and advanced reasoning capabilities show limited
correlation with detection accuracy, suggesting task-specific fine-tuning is
critical. This study underscores the potential of multi-modal LLMs in enhancing
document fraud detection systems and provides a foundation for future research
into interpretable and scalable fraud mitigation strategies.

Method: 提出一种零阶优化方法，自动发现最优层融合方案，并通过单任务优化和多目标优化两种策略满足不同临床需求。

Result: 在25个医学分割任务中，MedSAMix显著减少模型偏差，在专用任务和多任务评估中分别提升6.67%和4.37%的性能。

Conclusion: MedSAMix通过融合通用和专用模型，有效提升医学图像分割的领域特异性和泛化能力，为临床应用提供灵活解决方案。

Abstract: Universal medical image segmentation models have emerged as a promising
paradigm due to their strong generalizability across diverse tasks, showing
great potential for a wide range of clinical applications. This potential has
been partly driven by the success of general-purpose vision models such as the
Segment Anything Model (SAM), which has inspired the development of various
fine-tuned variants for medical segmentation tasks. However, fine-tuned
variants like MedSAM are trained on comparatively limited medical imaging data
that often suffers from heterogeneity, scarce annotations, and distributional
shifts. These challenges limit their ability to generalize across a wide range
of medical segmentation tasks. In this regard, we propose MedSAMix, a
training-free model merging method that integrates the strengths of both
generalist models (e.g., SAM) and specialist models (e.g., MedSAM) for medical
image segmentation. In contrast to traditional model merging approaches that
rely on manual configuration and often result in suboptimal outcomes, we
propose a zero-order optimization method to automatically discover optimal
layer-wise merging solutions. Furthermore, for clinical applications, we
develop two regimes to meet the demand of domain-specificity and
generalizability in different scenarios by single-task optimization and
multi-objective optimization respectively. Extensive evaluations on 25 medical
segmentation tasks demonstrate that MedSAMix effectively mitigates model bias
and consistently improves performance in both domain-specific accuracy and
generalization, achieving improvements of 6.67% on specialized tasks and 4.37%
on multi-task evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D视觉语言数据集在远距离多视角推理和上下文对齐方面存在不足，限制了模型的深度场景理解能力。

Method: 提出MV-ScanQA数据集测试多视角推理，TripAlign数据集提供2D-3D-语言预训练数据，并开发LEGO方法进行知识迁移。

Result: LEGO在MV-ScanQA和现有3D任务基准测试中均达到最优性能。

Conclusion: MV-ScanQA和TripAlign为3D视觉语言学习提供了更丰富的多视角和上下文对齐数据，LEGO方法展示了其有效性。

Abstract: The advancement of 3D vision-language (3D VL) learning is hindered by several
limitations in existing 3D VL datasets: they rarely necessitate reasoning
beyond a close range of objects in single viewpoint, and annotations often link
instructions to single objects, missing richer contextual alignments between
multiple objects. This significantly curtails the development of models capable
of deep, multi-view 3D scene understanding over distant objects. To address
these challenges, we introduce MV-ScanQA, a novel 3D question answering dataset
where 68% of questions explicitly require integrating information from multiple
views (compared to less than 7% in existing datasets), thereby rigorously
testing multi-view compositional reasoning. To facilitate the training of
models for such demanding scenarios, we present TripAlign dataset, a
large-scale and low-cost 2D-3D-language pre-training corpus containing 1M <2D
view, set of 3D objects, text> triplets that explicitly aligns groups of
contextually related objects with text, providing richer, view-grounded
multi-object multimodal alignment signals than previous single-object
annotations. We further develop LEGO, a baseline method for the multi-view
reasoning challenge in MV-ScanQA, transferring knowledge from pre-trained 2D
LVLMs to 3D domain with TripAlign. Empirically, LEGO pre-trained on TripAlign
achieves state-of-the-art performance not only on the proposed MV-ScanQA, but
also on existing benchmarks for 3D dense captioning and question answering.

TL;DR: DeCLIP改进CLIP模型，通过解耦自注意力模块提升密集视觉感知任务的性能，在多种任务中达到最优表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有密集视觉感知任务受限于预定义类别，且CLIP在密集感知中因局部特征表示不足表现不佳。

Method: 提出DeCLIP框架，解耦自注意力模块为“内容”和“上下文”特征，分别通过视觉基础模型和扩散模型增强。

Result: 在2D检测、3D实例分割、视频实例分割和6D物体姿态估计等任务中表现最优。

Conclusion: DeCLIP为开放词汇密集感知提供了坚实基础，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Dense visual perception tasks have been constrained by their reliance on
predefined categories, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios
where visual concepts are unbounded. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like
CLIP have shown promise in open-vocabulary tasks, their direct application to
dense perception often leads to suboptimal performance due to limitations in
local feature representation. In this work, we present our observation that
CLIP's image tokens struggle to effectively aggregate information from
spatially or semantically related regions, resulting in features that lack
local discriminability and spatial consistency. To address this issue, we
propose DeCLIP, a novel framework that enhances CLIP by decoupling the
self-attention module to obtain ``content'' and ``context'' features
respectively. \revise{The context features are enhanced by jointly distilling
semantic correlations from Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and object integrity
cues from diffusion models, thereby enhancing spatial consistency. In parallel,
the content features are aligned with image crop representations and
constrained by region correlations from VFMs to improve local discriminability.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeCLIP establishes a solid foundation
for open-vocabulary dense perception, consistently achieving state-of-the-art
performance across a broad spectrum of tasks, including 2D detection and
segmentation, 3D instance segmentation, video instance segmentation, and 6D
object pose estimation.} Code is available at

TL;DR: 研究通过AI分析3D临床影像，揭示不同BMI人群中腹部结构与2型糖尿病的关联，发现脂肪分布和器官特征与疾病风险相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管BMI是2型糖尿病的已知风险因素，但瘦人和肥胖者中疾病表现差异表明，详细的身体组成可能揭示腹部表型。

Method: 利用AI从临床CT中提取腹部结构的详细测量，通过随机森林分类和SHAP分析识别糖尿病相关特征。

Result: 随机森林模型的AUC为0.72-0.74，发现脂肪肌肉、内脏脂肪和胰腺特征在各类BMI人群中均与糖尿病相关。

Conclusion: 腹部特征对2型糖尿病的影响在不同体重类别中可能一致。

Abstract: Purpose: Although elevated BMI is a well-known risk factor for type 2
diabetes, the disease's presence in some lean adults and absence in others with
obesity suggests that detailed body composition may uncover abdominal
phenotypes of type 2 diabetes. With AI, we can now extract detailed
measurements of size, shape, and fat content from abdominal structures in 3D
clinical imaging at scale. This creates an opportunity to empirically define
body composition signatures linked to type 2 diabetes risk and protection using
large-scale clinical data. Approach: To uncover BMI-specific diabetic abdominal
patterns from clinical CT, we applied our design four times: once on the full
cohort (n = 1,728) and once on lean (n = 497), overweight (n = 611), and obese
(n = 620) subgroups separately. Briefly, our experimental design transforms
abdominal scans into collections of explainable measurements through
segmentation, classifies type 2 diabetes through a cross-validated random
forest, measures how features contribute to model-estimated risk or protection
through SHAP analysis, groups scans by shared model decision patterns
(clustering from SHAP) and links back to anatomical differences
(classification). Results: The random-forests achieved mean AUCs of 0.72-0.74.
There were shared type 2 diabetes signatures in each group; fatty skeletal
muscle, older age, greater visceral and subcutaneous fat, and a smaller or
fat-laden pancreas. Univariate logistic regression confirmed the direction of
14-18 of the top 20 predictors within each subgroup (p < 0.05). Conclusions:
Our findings suggest that abdominal drivers of type 2 diabetes may be
consistent across weight classes.

TL;DR: 研究发现对比视觉语言模型（VLM）在图像和文本对齐中隐含性别偏见，通过分析220张人脸照片和150条描述性语句的嵌入相似性，揭示了性别关联模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨视觉语言模型是否在共享表示空间中编码和放大社会性别刻板印象，尤其是职业和活动描述中的性别关联。

Method: 使用220张人脸照片（按感知性别分组）和150条语句（分六类），计算图像和文本嵌入的余弦相似性，定义性别关联分数，并通过自举置信区间和标签交换零模型验证。

Result: 发现对比视觉语言空间中存在显著的性别关联模式，提供了类别和语句级别的性别偏见评估框架。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了VLM中隐含的性别偏见，为未来模型的公平性评估提供了方法学支持。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLM) align images and text in a shared representation
space that is useful for retrieval and zero-shot transfer. Yet, this alignment
can encode and amplify social stereotypes in subtle ways that are not obvious
from standard accuracy metrics. In this study, we test whether the contrastive
vision-language encoder exhibits gender-linked associations when it places
embeddings of face images near embeddings of short phrases that describe
occupations and activities. We assemble a dataset of 220 face photographs split
by perceived binary gender and a set of 150 unique statements distributed
across six categories covering emotional labor, cognitive labor, domestic
labor, technical labor, professional roles, and physical labor. We compute
unit-norm image embeddings for every face and unit-norm text embeddings for
every statement, then define a statement-level association score as the
difference between the mean cosine similarity to the male set and the mean
cosine similarity to the female set, where positive values indicate stronger
association with the male set and negative values indicate stronger association
with the female set. We attach bootstrap confidence intervals by resampling
images within each gender group, aggregate by category with a separate
bootstrap over statements, and run a label-swap null model that estimates the
level of mean absolute association we would expect if no gender structure were
present. The outcome is a statement-wise and category-wise map of gender
associations in a contrastive vision-language space, accompanied by
uncertainty, simple sanity checks, and a robust gender bias evaluation
framework.

TL;DR: HierOctFusion是一种基于八叉树的多尺度扩散模型，通过分层的部分感知生成和跨注意力机制，提高了3D内容生成的精细度和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将3D对象视为整体，忽略了语义部分层次结构，且高分辨率建模计算成本高。HierOctFusion旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出HierOctFusion模型，结合部分感知的多尺度八叉树扩散和跨注意力机制，利用预训练分割模型构建带部分标注的3D数据集。

Result: 实验表明，HierOctFusion在形状质量和效率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HierOctFusion通过分层生成和部分感知机制，显著提升了3D内容生成的性能。

Abstract: 3D content generation remains a fundamental yet challenging task due to the
inherent structural complexity of 3D data. While recent octree-based diffusion
models offer a promising balance between efficiency and quality through
hierarchical generation, they often overlook two key insights: 1) existing
methods typically model 3D objects as holistic entities, ignoring their
semantic part hierarchies and limiting generalization; and 2) holistic
high-resolution modeling is computationally expensive, whereas real-world
objects are inherently sparse and hierarchical, making them well-suited for
layered generation. Motivated by these observations, we propose HierOctFusion,
a part-aware multi-scale octree diffusion model that enhances hierarchical
feature interaction for generating fine-grained and sparse object structures.
Furthermore, we introduce a cross-attention conditioning mechanism that injects
part-level information into the generation process, enabling semantic features
to propagate effectively across hierarchical levels from parts to the whole.
Additionally, we construct a 3D dataset with part category annotations using a
pre-trained segmentation model to facilitate training and evaluation.
Experiments demonstrate that HierOctFusion achieves superior shape quality and
efficiency compared to prior methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PMTFR的框架，通过Pyramid Patcher模块和Training-Free Refinement范式，提升了监督式CIR任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在监督式CIR任务中表现不佳，且需要额外训练排序模型，限制了Chain-of-Thought技术的应用。

Method: 结合Pyramid Matching Model和Training-Free Refinement范式，利用Pyramid Patcher模块增强视觉信息理解，并通过CO数据注入表示提升性能。

Result: 在CIR基准测试中，PMTFR优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: PMTFR框架在监督式CIR任务中表现出色，无需额外训练即可提升性能。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) presents a significant challenge as it
requires jointly understanding a reference image and a modified textual
instruction to find relevant target images. Some existing methods attempt to
use a two-stage approach to further refine retrieval results. However, this
often requires additional training of a ranking model. Despite the success of
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques in reducing training costs for language
models, their application in CIR tasks remains limited -- compressing visual
information into text or relying on elaborate prompt designs. Besides, existing
works only utilize it for zero-shot CIR, as it is challenging to achieve
satisfactory results in supervised CIR with a well-trained model. In this work,
we proposed a framework that includes the Pyramid Matching Model with
Training-Free Refinement (PMTFR) to address these challenges. Through a simple
but effective module called Pyramid Patcher, we enhanced the Pyramid Matching
Model's understanding of visual information at different granularities.
Inspired by representation engineering, we extracted representations from COT
data and injected them into the LVLMs. This approach allowed us to obtain
refined retrieval scores in the Training-Free Refinement paradigm without
relying on explicit textual reasoning, further enhancing performance. Extensive
experiments on CIR benchmarks demonstrate that PMTFR surpasses state-of-the-art
methods in supervised CIR tasks. The code will be made public.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于残差的双向扩散模型（RBDM），用于实现无雾图像和有雾图像之间的双向转换。通过双马尔可夫链和统一评分函数，模型在少量采样步骤下实现了高效转换，并在实验中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度去雾方法仅关注去雾，缺乏有雾和无雾图像之间的双向转换能力。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出RBDM模型，利用双马尔可夫链处理残差，通过扰动图像和预测噪声学习条件分布，并使用统一评分函数降低计算成本。

Result: RBDM在仅15步采样下实现了高效双向转换，实验表明其性能优于或与现有方法相当。

Conclusion: RBDM成功实现了有雾和无雾图像的高效双向转换，为图像处理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Current deep dehazing methods only focus on removing haze from hazy images,
lacking the capability to translate between hazy and haze-free images. To
address this issue, we propose a residual-based efficient bidirectional
diffusion model (RBDM) that can model the conditional distributions for both
dehazing and haze generation. Firstly, we devise dual Markov chains that can
effectively shift the residuals and facilitate bidirectional smooth transitions
between them. Secondly, the RBDM perturbs the hazy and haze-free images at
individual timesteps and predicts the noise in the perturbed data to
simultaneously learn the conditional distributions. Finally, to enhance
performance on relatively small datasets and reduce computational costs, our
method introduces a unified score function learned on image patches instead of
entire images. Our RBDM successfully implements size-agnostic bidirectional
transitions between haze-free and hazy images with only 15 sampling steps.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior or
at least comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic
and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: LEARN为生成式AI在教育领域的应用提供了新方向，结合了基于布局的叙事、语义结构学习和认知支架。

Abstract: LEARN is a layout-aware diffusion framework designed to generate
pedagogically aligned illustrations for STEM education. It leverages a curated
BookCover dataset that provides narrative layouts and structured visual cues,
enabling the model to depict abstract and sequential scientific concepts with
strong semantic alignment. Through layout-conditioned generation, contrastive
visual-semantic training, and prompt modulation, LEARN produces coherent visual
sequences that support mid-to-high-level reasoning in line with Bloom's
taxonomy while reducing extraneous cognitive load as emphasized by Cognitive
Load Theory. By fostering spatially organized and story-driven narratives, the
framework counters fragmented attention often induced by short-form media and
promotes sustained conceptual focus. Beyond static diagrams, LEARN demonstrates
potential for integration with multimodal systems and curriculum-linked
knowledge graphs to create adaptive, exploratory educational content. As the
first generative approach to unify layout-based storytelling, semantic
structure learning, and cognitive scaffolding, LEARN represents a novel
direction for generative AI in education. The code and dataset will be released
to facilitate future research and practical deployment.

Motivation: 探索RETFound在视盘分割任务中的潜力，验证基础模型在特定任务中的适用性。

Method: 通过训练一个头部网络，利用RETFound模型对视盘进行分割，并在多个数据集上验证性能。

Result: 在多个公开和私有数据集上达到约96%的Dice分数，表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RETFound在视盘分割任务中表现出色，为基础模型替代任务特定架构提供了有力支持。

Abstract: RETFound is a well-known foundation model (FM) developed for fundus camera
and optical coherence tomography images. It has shown promising performance
across multiple datasets in diagnosing diseases, both eye-specific and
systemic, from retinal images. However, to our best knowledge, it has not been
used for other tasks. We present the first adaptation of RETFound for optic
disc segmentation, a ubiquitous and foundational task in retinal image
analysis. The resulting segmentation system outperforms state-of-the-art,
segmentation-specific baseline networks after training a head with only a very
modest number of task-specific examples. We report and discuss results with
four public datasets, IDRID, Drishti-GS, RIM-ONE-r3, and REFUGE, and a private
dataset, GoDARTS, achieving about 96% Dice consistently across all datasets.
Overall, our method obtains excellent performance in internal verification,
domain generalization and domain adaptation, and exceeds most of the
state-of-the-art baseline results. We discuss the results in the framework of
the debate about FMs as alternatives to task-specific architectures. The code

Conclusion: EM-B3DM高效且性能优越，适用于真实世界去雾任务。

Abstract: Existing dehazing methods deal with real-world haze images with difficulty,
especially scenes with thick haze. One of the main reasons is the lack of
real-world paired data and robust priors. To avoid the costly collection of
paired hazy and clear images, we propose an efficient semi-supervised image
dehazing method via Expectation-Maximization and Bidirectional Brownian Bridge
Diffusion Models (EM-B3DM) with a two-stage learning scheme. In the first
stage, we employ the EM algorithm to decouple the joint distribution of paired
hazy and clear images into two conditional distributions, which are then
modeled using a unified Brownian Bridge diffusion model to directly capture the
structural and content-related correlations between hazy and clear images. In
the second stage, we leverage the pre-trained model and large-scale unpaired
hazy and clear images to further improve the performance of image dehazing.
Additionally, we introduce a detail-enhanced Residual Difference Convolution
block (RDC) to capture gradient-level information, significantly enhancing the
model's representation capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
EM-B3DM achieves superior or at least comparable performance to
state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Method: 对SRL损失函数的梯度进行理论分析，并在多个管状数据集上比较其与传统基线模型的性能。

Result: 实验表明，SRL在管状结构分割任务中并未显著优于传统基线模型。

Conclusion: 拓扑保持损失函数在复杂管状结构分割中存在局限性，为未来研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Image segmentation is an important and widely performed task in computer
vision. Accomplishing effective image segmentation in diverse settings often
requires custom model architectures and loss functions. A set of models that
specialize in segmenting thin tubular structures are topology
preservation-based loss functions. These models often utilize a pixel
skeletonization process claimed to generate more precise segmentation masks of
thin tubes and better capture the structures that other models often miss. One
such model, Skeleton Recall Loss (SRL) proposed by Kirchhoff et al.~\cite
{kirchhoff2024srl}, was stated to produce state-of-the-art results on benchmark
tubular datasets. In this work, we performed a theoretical analysis of the
gradients for the SRL loss. Upon comparing the performance of the proposed
method on some of the tubular datasets (used in the original work, along with
some additional datasets), we found that the performance of SRL-based
segmentation models did not exceed traditional baseline models. By providing
both a theoretical explanation and empirical evidence, this work critically
evaluates the limitations of topology-based loss functions, offering valuable
insights for researchers aiming to develop more effective segmentation models
for complex tubular structures.

Motivation: 在遥感图像中，源自由目标检测（SFOD）因伪标签噪声和复杂背景易导致训练崩溃，而少量目标域标注在实践中可行。

Method: VG-DETR结合视觉基础模型（VFM），通过伪标签挖掘策略和双级对齐（实例级和图像级）减少噪声并增强特征表示。

Result: 实验表明VG-DETR在源自由遥感检测任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: VG-DETR通过VFM的语义先验和双级对齐，显著提升了SFOD的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation methods have been widely explored to bridge
domain gaps. However, in real-world remote-sensing scenarios, privacy and
transmission constraints often preclude access to source domain data, which
limits their practical applicability. Recently, Source-Free Object Detection
(SFOD) has emerged as a promising alternative, aiming at cross-domain
adaptation without relying on source data, primarily through a self-training
paradigm. Despite its potential, SFOD frequently suffers from training collapse
caused by noisy pseudo-labels, especially in remote sensing imagery with dense
objects and complex backgrounds. Considering that limited target domain
annotations are often feasible in practice, we propose a Vision
foundation-Guided DEtection TRansformer (VG-DETR), built upon a semi-supervised
framework for SFOD in remote sensing images. VG-DETR integrates a Vision
Foundation Model (VFM) into the training pipeline in a "free lunch" manner,
leveraging a small amount of labeled target data to mitigate pseudo-label noise
while improving the detector's feature-extraction capability. Specifically, we
introduce a VFM-guided pseudo-label mining strategy that leverages the VFM's
semantic priors to further assess the reliability of the generated
pseudo-labels. By recovering potentially correct predictions from
low-confidence outputs, our strategy improves pseudo-label quality and
quantity. In addition, a dual-level VFM-guided alignment method is proposed,
which aligns detector features with VFM embeddings at both the instance and
image levels. Through contrastive learning among fine-grained prototypes and
similarity matching between feature maps, this dual-level alignment further
enhances the robustness of feature representations against domain gaps.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that VG-DETR achieves superior performance in
source-free remote sensing detection tasks.

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: G-CUT3R能有效利用先验信息，同时兼容不同输入模态。

Abstract: We introduce G-CUT3R, a novel feed-forward approach for guided 3D scene
reconstruction that enhances the CUT3R model by integrating prior information.
Unlike existing feed-forward methods that rely solely on input images, our
method leverages auxiliary data, such as depth, camera calibrations, or camera
positions, commonly available in real-world scenarios. We propose a lightweight
modification to CUT3R, incorporating a dedicated encoder for each modality to
extract features, which are fused with RGB image tokens via zero convolution.
This flexible design enables seamless integration of any combination of prior
information during inference. Evaluated across multiple benchmarks, including
3D reconstruction and other multi-view tasks, our approach demonstrates
significant performance improvements, showing its ability to effectively
utilize available priors while maintaining compatibility with varying input
modalities.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为IDOD的方法，用于连续类别发现（CCD），通过独立多样性增强、联合新颖性发现和正交性增量模块，解决了现有方法在分类与新颖类发现之间的矛盾，同时减少了存储开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CCD方法难以平衡新颖类发现与分类任务，且容易积累错误并占用大量存储空间。

Method: IDOD包含三个模块：独立多样性增强（对比损失训练）、联合新颖性发现（单阶段转换）和正交性增量（正交原型生成与低开销表示回放）。

Result: 在细粒度数据集上，IDOD优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: IDOD有效解决了CCD中的矛盾问题，减少了错误积累和存储需求，性能优越。

Abstract: Continuous category discovery (CCD) aims to automatically discover novel
categories in continuously arriving unlabeled data. This is a challenging
problem considering that there is no number of categories and labels in the
newly arrived data, while also needing to mitigate catastrophic forgetting.
Most CCD methods cannot handle the contradiction between novel class discovery
and classification well. They are also prone to accumulate errors in the
process of gradually discovering novel classes. Moreover, most of them use
knowledge distillation and data replay to prevent forgetting, occupying more
storage space. To address these limitations, we propose Independence-based
Diversity and Orthogonality-based Discrimination (IDOD). IDOD mainly includes
independent enrichment of diversity module, joint discovery of novelty module,
and continuous increment by orthogonality module. In independent enrichment,
the backbone is trained separately using contrastive loss to avoid it focusing
only on features for classification. Joint discovery transforms multi-stage
novel class discovery into single-stage, reducing error accumulation impact.
Continuous increment by orthogonality module generates mutually orthogonal
prototypes for classification and prevents forgetting with lower space overhead
via representative representation replay. Experimental results show that on
challenging fine-grained datasets, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods.

textual-visual modalities via explicit spatial proximity in the underlying
embedding space, which i) fails to capture the inherent one-to-many
associations between categories and image samples and ii) struggles to
establish accurate associations between the unknown categories and images. To
address these issues, inspired by recent works on hyperbolic learning, we
develop a novel Latent Hierarchical Adapter (LatHAdapter) for fine-tuning VLMs
on downstream few-shot classification tasks. The core of LatHAdapter is to
exploit the latent semantic hierarchy of downstream training data and employ it
to provide richer, fine-grained guidance for the adapter learning process.
Specifically, LatHAdapter first introduces some learnable `attribute' prompts
as the bridge to align categories and images. Then, it projects the categories,
attribute prompts, and images within each batch in a hyperbolic space, and
employs hierarchical regularization to learn the latent semantic hierarchy of
them, thereby fully modeling the inherent one-to-many associations among
categories, learnable attributes, and image samples. Extensive experiments on
four challenging few-shot tasks show that the proposed LatHAdapter consistently
outperforms many other fine-tuning approaches, particularly in adapting known
classes and generalizing to unknown classes.

*Daniel Airinei,Elena Burceanu,Marius Leordeanu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉输入的实时室内导航方法，无需特殊传感器或地图知识，通过深度学习预测目标方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 室内导航因GPS信号差而困难，现有解决方案复杂且难以部署。

Method: 采用图基路径生成方法，结合可解释数据增强和课程学习，实现高效自动化的数据收集与训练。

Result: 创建了一个大型购物中心视频数据集，并开发了易于使用的Android应用。

Conclusion: 该方法仅依赖视觉输入，无需额外传感器或标记，具有高效和易部署的优势。

Abstract: Indoor navigation is a difficult task, as it generally comes with poor GPS
access, forcing solutions to rely on other sources of information. While
significant progress continues to be made in this area, deployment to
production applications is still lacking, given the complexity and additional
requirements of current solutions. Here, we introduce an efficient, real-time
and easily deployable deep learning approach, based on visual input only, that
can predict the direction towards a target from images captured by a mobile
device. Our technical approach, based on a novel graph-based path generation
method, combined with explainable data augmentation and curriculum learning,
includes contributions that make the process of data collection, annotation and
training, as automatic as possible, efficient and robust. On the practical
side, we introduce a novel largescale dataset, with video footage inside a
relatively large shopping mall, in which each frame is annotated with the
correct next direction towards different specific target destinations.
Different from current methods, ours relies solely on vision, avoiding the need
of special sensors, additional markers placed along the path, knowledge of the
scene map or internet access. We also created an easy to use application for
Android, which we plan to make publicly available. We make all our data and
code available along with visual demos on our project site

TL;DR: GVT是一种基于2D高斯生成策略的视频标记化方法，通过空间-时间高斯嵌入和静态动态分离策略，提升了视频处理的适应性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频标记化方法在空间和时间维度上存在局限性，如固定网格标记导致冗余或无法区分静态与动态内容。

Method: GVT采用2D高斯生成策略，通过STGE机制提取潜在刚性特征，并用GSP策略分离静态和动态内容。

Result: GVT在视频重建、动作识别和压缩任务中表现优异，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: GVT通过高斯生成和内容分离策略，显著提升了视频标记化的性能和适应性。

Abstract: Video tokenization procedure is critical for a wide range of video processing
tasks. Most existing approaches directly transform video into fixed-grid and
patch-wise tokens, which exhibit limited versatility. Spatially, uniformly
allocating a fixed number of tokens often leads to over-encoding in
low-information regions. Temporally, reducing redundancy remains challenging
without explicitly distinguishing between static and dynamic content. In this
work, we propose the Gaussian Video Transformer (GVT), a versatile video
tokenizer built upon a generative 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) strategy. We
first extract latent rigid features from a video clip and represent them with a
set of 2D Gaussians generated by our proposed Spatio-Temporal Gaussian
Embedding (STGE) mechanism in a feed-forward manner. Such generative 2D
Gaussians not only enhance spatial adaptability by assigning higher (resp.,
lower) rendering weights to regions with higher (resp., lower) information
content during rasterization, but also improve generalization by avoiding
per-video optimization.To enhance the temporal versatility, we introduce a
Gaussian Set Partitioning (GSP) strategy that separates the 2D Gaussians into
static and dynamic sets, which explicitly model static content shared across
different time-steps and dynamic content specific to each time-step, enabling a
compact representation.We primarily evaluate GVT on the video reconstruction,
while also assessing its performance on action recognition and compression
using the UCF101, Kinetics, and DAVIS datasets. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that GVT achieves a state-of-the-art video reconstruction quality,
outperforms the baseline MAGVIT-v2 in action recognition, and delivers
comparable compression performance.

Result: CHARM3R在CARLA数据集上对未见相机高度的泛化能力提升超过45%，达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: CHARM3R有效解决了相机高度变化带来的性能问题，为单目3D检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detectors, while effective on data from one ego camera
height, struggle with unseen or out-of-distribution camera heights. Existing
methods often rely on Plucker embeddings, image transformations or data
augmentation. This paper takes a step towards this understudied problem by
first investigating the impact of camera height variations on state-of-the-art
(SoTA) Mono3D models. With a systematic analysis on the extended CARLA dataset
with multiple camera heights, we observe that depth estimation is a primary
factor influencing performance under height variations. We mathematically prove
and also empirically observe consistent negative and positive trends in mean
depth error of regressed and ground-based depth models, respectively, under
camera height changes. To mitigate this, we propose Camera Height Robust
Monocular 3D Detector (CHARM3R), which averages both depth estimates within the
model. CHARM3R improves generalization to unseen camera heights by more than
$45\%$, achieving SoTA performance on the CARLA dataset. Codes and Models at

Abstract: Historical handwritten text recognition (HTR) is essential for unlocking the
cultural and scholarly value of archival documents, yet digitization is often
hindered by scarce transcriptions, linguistic variation, and highly diverse
handwriting styles. In this study, we apply TrOCR, a state-of-the-art
transformer-based HTR model, to 16th-century Latin manuscripts authored by
Rudolf Gwalther. We investigate targeted image preprocessing and a broad suite
of data augmentation techniques, introducing four novel augmentation methods
designed specifically for historical handwriting characteristics. We also
evaluate ensemble learning approaches to leverage the complementary strengths
of augmentation-trained models. On the Gwalther dataset, our best single-model
augmentation (Elastic) achieves a Character Error Rate (CER) of 1.86, while a
top-5 voting ensemble achieves a CER of 1.60 - representing a 50% relative
improvement over the best reported TrOCR_BASE result and a 42% improvement over
the previous state of the art. These results highlight the impact of
domain-specific augmentations and ensemble strategies in advancing HTR
performance for historical manuscripts.

Abstract: Many everyday tasks ranging from fixing appliances, cooking recipes to car

we propose a simple yet effective approach that transforms single-person

effort required for human-assisted data collection. Using this technique, we
build HowToDIV, a large-scale dataset containing 507 conversations, 6636
question-answer pairs and 24 hours of videoclips across diverse tasks in
cooking, mechanics, and planting. Each session includes multi-turn conversation
where an expert teaches a novice user how to perform a task step by step, while
observing user's surrounding through a camera and microphone equipped wearable
device. We establish the baseline benchmark performance on HowToDIV dataset
through Gemma-3 model for future research on this new task of dialogues for

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种轻量级视觉语言模型UAV-VL-R1，专为无人机航拍图像设计，通过混合监督微调和多阶段强化学习方法提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用视觉语言模型在无人机航拍图像上性能下降，因其高分辨率、复杂空间语义和实时性要求。

Method: 采用混合方法（监督微调+多阶段强化学习）和GRPO算法，结合规则引导奖励和组内策略对齐。

Result: UAV-VL-R1在零样本任务中比基线模型准确率提升48.17%，且内存占用低，支持实时部署。

Conclusion: UAV-VL-R1在航拍图像任务中表现出色，强化学习弥补了监督微调在数学任务中的多样性不足。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong
generalization in natural image tasks. However, their performance often
degrades on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based aerial imagery, which features
high resolution, complex spatial semantics, and strict real-time constraints.
These challenges limit the applicability of general-purpose VLMs to structured
aerial reasoning tasks. To address these challenges, we propose UAV-VL-R1, a
lightweight VLM explicitly designed for aerial visual reasoning. It is trained
using a hybrid method that combines supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
multi-stage reinforcement learning (RL). We leverage the group relative policy
optimization (GRPO) algorithm to promote structured and interpretable reasoning
through rule-guided rewards and intra-group policy alignment. To support model
training and evaluation, we introduce a high-resolution visual question
answering dataset named HRVQA-VL, which consists of 50,019 annotated samples
covering eight UAV-relevant reasoning tasks, including object counting,
transportation recognition, and spatial scene inference. Experimental results
show that UAV-VL-R1 achieves a 48.17% higher zero-shot accuracy than the
Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct baseline and even outperforms its 72B-scale variant, which
is 36x larger, on multiple tasks. Ablation studies reveal that while SFT
improves semantic alignment, it may reduce reasoning diversity in mathematical
tasks. GRPO-based RL compensates for this limitation by enhancing logical
flexibility and the robustness of inference. Additionally, UAV-VL-R1 requires
only 3.9GB of memory under FP16 inference and can be quantized to 2.5GB with
INT8, supporting real-time deployment on resource-constrained UAV platforms.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着MLLMs的广泛应用，需要适应多样化的用户需求，本文旨在通过可控解码实现这一目标。

Method: 构建两个独立的奖励模型，分别控制对象精度和召回率，并通过动态调整奖励函数的权重和解码搜索范围，实现MLLM推理过程的实时可控性。

Result: 在标准对象幻觉基准测试中，该方法显著优于现有幻觉缓解方法，并提供了对MLLM推理的高度可控性。

Conclusion: 该方法为MLLMs的适应提供了有效的可控解码策略，显著提升了视觉定位能力。

Abstract: As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) gain widespread applicability, it
is becoming increasingly desirable to adapt them for diverse user needs. In
this paper, we study the adaptation of MLLMs through controlled decoding. To
achieve this, we introduce the first method for reward-guided decoding of MLLMs
and demonstrate its application in improving their visual grounding. Our method
involves building reward models for visual grounding and using them to guide
the MLLM's decoding process. Concretely, we build two separate reward models to
independently control the degree of object precision and recall in the model's
output. Our approach enables on-the-fly controllability of an MLLM's inference
process in two ways: first, by giving control over the relative importance of
each reward function during decoding, allowing a user to dynamically trade off
object precision for recall in image captioning tasks; second, by giving
control over the breadth of the search during decoding, allowing the user to
control the trade-off between the amount of test-time compute and the degree of
visual grounding. We evaluate our method on standard object hallucination
benchmarks, showing that it provides significant controllability over MLLM
inference, while consistently outperforming existing hallucination mitigation
methods.

Motivation: 现有的人体姿态估计方法计算资源消耗大，传统知识蒸馏未充分利用关节上下文信息，因此提出新框架以提升轻量模型的准确性。

Method: 两阶段知识蒸馏：第一阶段通过关节结构损失传递语义知识；第二阶段使用IGP-GCN渐进式优化初始姿态。

Result: 在COCO和CrowdPose数据集上表现优异，尤其在复杂场景下性能提升显著。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效提升了轻量模型的姿态估计性能，尤其在复杂场景中表现突出。

Abstract: Human pose estimation has been widely applied in the human-centric
understanding and generation, but most existing state-of-the-art human pose
estimation methods require heavy computational resources for accurate
predictions. In order to obtain an accurate, robust yet lightweight human pose
estimator, one feasible way is to transfer pose knowledge from a powerful
teacher model to a less-parameterized student model by knowledge distillation.
However, the traditional knowledge distillation framework does not fully
explore the contextual information among human joints. Thus, in this paper, we
propose a novel coarse-to-fine two-stage knowledge distillation framework for
human pose estimation. In the first-stage distillation, we introduce the human
joints structure loss to mine the structural information among human joints so
as to transfer high-level semantic knowledge from the teacher model to the
student model. In the second-stage distillation, we utilize an Image-Guided
Progressive Graph Convolutional Network (IGP-GCN) to refine the initial human
pose obtained from the first-stage distillation and supervise the training of
the IGP-GCN in the progressive way by the final output pose of teacher model.
The extensive experiments on the benchmark dataset: COCO keypoint and CrowdPose
datasets, show that our proposed method performs favorably against lots of the
existing state-of-the-art human pose estimation methods, especially for the
more complex CrowdPose dataset, the performance improvement of our model is
more significant.

Motivation: 评估通用大语言模型（如GPT-5和GPT-4o）在乳腺X光片视觉问答任务中的潜力，以支持乳腺癌筛查。

Method: 在四个公开乳腺X光片数据集（EMBED、InBreast、CMMD、CBIS-DDSM）上测试GPT-5和GPT-4o，评估其在BI-RADS分级、异常检测和恶性分类任务中的表现。

Result: GPT-5在多个任务中表现最佳，但敏感性和特异性低于人类专家。例如，在EMBED数据集上，其恶性分类准确率为52.8%。

Conclusion: GPT-5在乳腺X光片任务中展现出潜力，但仍需领域适配和优化才能用于高风险临床影像应用。

Abstract: Mammogram visual question answering (VQA) integrates image interpretation
with clinical reasoning and has potential to support breast cancer screening.
We systematically evaluated the GPT-5 family and GPT-4o model on four public
mammography datasets (EMBED, InBreast, CMMD, CBIS-DDSM) for BI-RADS assessment,
abnormality detection, and malignancy classification tasks. GPT-5 consistently
was the best performing model but lagged behind both human experts and
domain-specific fine-tuned models. On EMBED, GPT-5 achieved the highest scores
among GPT variants in density (56.8%), distortion (52.5%), mass (64.5%),
calcification (63.5%), and malignancy (52.8%) classification. On InBreast, it
attained 36.9% BI-RADS accuracy, 45.9% abnormality detection, and 35.0%
malignancy classification. On CMMD, GPT-5 reached 32.3% abnormality detection
and 55.0% malignancy accuracy. On CBIS-DDSM, it achieved 69.3% BI-RADS
accuracy, 66.0% abnormality detection, and 58.2% malignancy accuracy. Compared
with human expert estimations, GPT-5 exhibited lower sensitivity (63.5%) and
specificity (52.3%). While GPT-5 exhibits promising capabilities for screening
tasks, its performance remains insufficient for high-stakes clinical imaging
applications without targeted domain adaptation and optimization. However, the
tremendous improvements in performance from GPT-4o to GPT-5 show a promising
trend in the potential for general large language models (LLMs) to assist with
mammography VQA tasks.

Motivation: 自动驾驶中行人重识别面临多模态输入不确定或缺失的挑战，现有大规模预训练模型计算开销大，难以实际部署。

Method: UMM框架整合多模态令牌映射器、合成模态增强策略和跨模态线索交互学习器，利用CLIP的视觉-语言对齐能力高效融合多模态输入。

Result: 实验表明UMM在不确定模态条件下具有强鲁棒性、泛化能力和计算效率。

Conclusion: UMM为自动驾驶中的行人重识别提供了可扩展且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Re-Identification (ReID) is a critical technology in intelligent perception
systems, especially within autonomous driving, where onboard cameras must
identify pedestrians across views and time in real-time to support safe
navigation and trajectory prediction. However, the presence of uncertain or
missing input modalities--such as RGB, infrared, sketches, or textual
descriptions--poses significant challenges to conventional ReID approaches.
While large-scale pre-trained models offer strong multimodal semantic modeling
capabilities, their computational overhead limits practical deployment in
resource-constrained environments. To address these challenges, we propose a
lightweight Uncertainty Modal Modeling (UMM) framework, which integrates a
multimodal token mapper, synthetic modality augmentation strategy, and
cross-modal cue interactive learner. Together, these components enable unified
feature representation, mitigate the impact of missing modalities, and extract
complementary information across different data types. Additionally, UMM
leverages CLIP's vision-language alignment ability to fuse multimodal inputs
efficiently without extensive finetuning. Experimental results demonstrate that
UMM achieves strong robustness, generalization, and computational efficiency
under uncertain modality conditions, offering a scalable and practical solution
for pedestrian re-identification in autonomous driving scenarios.

Conclusion: Talking-Critic和TLPO有效解决了多维偏好对齐问题，为音频驱动肖像动画提供了更高质量和更自然的生成结果。

Abstract: Recent advances in audio-driven portrait animation have demonstrated
impressive capabilities. However, existing methods struggle to align with
fine-grained human preferences across multiple dimensions, such as motion
naturalness, lip-sync accuracy, and visual quality. This is due to the
difficulty of optimizing among competing preference objectives, which often
conflict with one another, and the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality
datasets with multidimensional preference annotations. To address these, we
first introduce Talking-Critic, a multimodal reward model that learns
human-aligned reward functions to quantify how well generated videos satisfy
multidimensional expectations. Leveraging this model, we curate Talking-NSQ, a
large-scale multidimensional human preference dataset containing 410K
preference pairs. Finally, we propose Timestep-Layer adaptive multi-expert
Preference Optimization (TLPO), a novel framework for aligning diffusion-based
portrait animation models with fine-grained, multidimensional preferences. TLPO
decouples preferences into specialized expert modules, which are then fused
across timesteps and network layers, enabling comprehensive, fine-grained
enhancement across all dimensions without mutual interference. Experiments
demonstrate that Talking-Critic significantly outperforms existing methods in
aligning with human preference ratings. Meanwhile, TLPO achieves substantial
improvements over baseline models in lip-sync accuracy, motion naturalness, and
visual quality, exhibiting superior performance in both qualitative and
quantitative evaluations. Ours project page:

Conclusion: 通过类别级几何学习和几何一致性对齐，该方法有效提升了3D语义分割的域泛化能力。

Abstract: Domain generalization in 3D segmentation is a critical challenge in deploying
models to unseen environments. Current methods mitigate the domain shift by
augmenting the data distribution of point clouds. However, the model learns
global geometric patterns in point clouds while ignoring the category-level
distribution and alignment. In this paper, a category-level geometry learning
framework is proposed to explore the domain-invariant geometric features for
domain generalized 3D semantic segmentation. Specifically, Category-level
Geometry Embedding (CGE) is proposed to perceive the fine-grained geometric
properties of point cloud features, which constructs the geometric properties
of each class and couples geometric embedding to semantic learning. Secondly,
Geometric Consistent Learning (GCL) is proposed to simulate the latent 3D
distribution and align the category-level geometric embeddings, allowing the
model to focus on the geometric invariant information to improve
generalization. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed
method, which has very competitive segmentation accuracy compared with the
state-of-the-art domain generalized point cloud methods.

Conclusion: SAEs在视觉模型中具有显著潜力，可提升可解释性、泛化能力和可控性。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a popular tool for interpreting
the hidden states of large language models (LLMs). By learning to reconstruct
activations from a sparse bottleneck layer, SAEs discover interpretable
features from the high-dimensional internal representations of LLMs. Despite
their popularity with language models, SAEs remain understudied in the visual
domain. In this work, we provide an extensive evaluation the representational
power of SAEs for vision models using a broad range of image-based tasks. Our
experimental results demonstrate that SAE features are semantically meaningful,
improve out-of-distribution generalization, and enable controllable generation
across three vision model architectures: vision embedding models, multi-modal
LMMs and diffusion models. In vision embedding models, we find that learned SAE
features can be used for OOD detection and provide evidence that they recover
the ontological structure of the underlying model. For diffusion models, we
demonstrate that SAEs enable semantic steering through text encoder
manipulation and develop an automated pipeline for discovering
human-interpretable attributes. Finally, we conduct exploratory experiments on
multi-modal LLMs, finding evidence that SAE features reveal shared
representations across vision and language modalities. Our study provides a
foundation for SAE evaluation in vision models, highlighting their strong
potential improving interpretability, generalization, and steerability in the
visual domain.

Abstract: Accurate endoscope pose estimation and 3D tissue surface reconstruction
significantly enhances monocular minimally invasive surgical procedures by
enabling accurate navigation and improved spatial awareness. However, monocular
endoscope pose estimation and tissue reconstruction face persistent challenges,
including depth ambiguity, physiological tissue deformation, inconsistent
endoscope motion, limited texture fidelity, and a restricted field of view. To
overcome these limitations, a unified framework for monocular endoscopic tissue
reconstruction that integrates scale-aware depth prediction with
temporally-constrained perceptual refinement is presented. This framework
incorporates a novel MAPIS-Depth module, which leverages Depth Pro for robust
initialisation and Depth Anything for efficient per-frame depth prediction, in
conjunction with L-BFGS-B optimisation, to generate pseudo-metric depth
estimates. These estimates are temporally refined by computing pixel
correspondences using RAFT and adaptively blending flow-warped frames based on
LPIPS perceptual similarity, thereby reducing artefacts arising from
physiological tissue deformation and motion. To ensure accurate registration of
the synthesised pseudo-RGBD frames from MAPIS-Depth, a novel WEMA-RTDL module
is integrated, optimising both rotation and translation. Finally, truncated
signed distance function-based volumetric fusion and marching cubes are applied
to extract a comprehensive 3D surface mesh. Evaluations on HEVD and SCARED,
with ablation and comparative analyses, demonstrate the framework's robustness
and superiority over state-of-the-art methods.

Result: 实验表明，TimeMachine在细粒度年龄编辑和身份一致性保持方面达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: TimeMachine通过创新的模块设计和高质量数据集，有效解决了细粒度年龄编辑的挑战。

Abstract: With the advancement of generative models, facial image editing has made
significant progress. However, achieving fine-grained age editing while
preserving personal identity remains a challenging task.In this paper, we
propose TimeMachine, a novel diffusion-based framework that achieves accurate
age editing while keeping identity features unchanged. To enable fine-grained
age editing, we inject high-precision age information into the multi-cross
attention module, which explicitly separates age-related and identity-related
features. This design facilitates more accurate disentanglement of age
attributes, thereby allowing precise and controllable manipulation of facial
aging.Furthermore, we propose an Age Classifier Guidance (ACG) module that
predicts age directly in the latent space, instead of performing denoising
image reconstruction during training. By employing a lightweight module to
incorporate age constraints, this design enhances age editing accuracy by
modest increasing training cost. Additionally, to address the lack of
large-scale, high-quality facial age datasets, we construct a HFFA dataset
(High-quality Fine-grained Facial-Age dataset) which contains one million
high-resolution images labeled with identity and facial attributes.
Experimental results demonstrate that TimeMachine achieves state-of-the-art
performance in fine-grained age editing while preserving identity consistency.

Motivation: RGB成像中的颜色同现问题导致行人与背景难以区分，影响自动驾驶系统的安全性。

Method: 比较了RGB与两种降维方法（PCA和CSNR-JMIM）的效果，评估了三种语义分割模型。

Result: CSNR-JMIM方法在行人和骑行者分割中均表现最佳，IoU和F1分数显著提升。

Conclusion: 优化HSI波段选择可有效提升行人分割性能，对自动驾驶安全应用具有重要价值。

Abstract: Pedestrian segmentation in automotive perception systems faces critical
safety challenges due to metamerism in RGB imaging, where pedestrians and
backgrounds appear visually indistinguishable.. This study investigates the
potential of hyperspectral imaging (HSI) for enhanced pedestrian segmentation
in urban driving scenarios using the Hyperspectral City v2 (H-City) dataset. We
compared standard RGB against two dimensionality-reduction approaches by
converting 128-channel HSI data into three-channel representations: Principal
Component Analysis (PCA) and optimal band selection using Contrast
Signal-to-Noise Ratio with Joint Mutual Information Maximization (CSNR-JMIM).
Three semantic segmentation models were evaluated: U-Net, DeepLabV3+, and
SegFormer. CSNR-JMIM consistently outperformed RGB with an average improvements
of 1.44% in Intersection over Union (IoU) and 2.18% in F1-score for pedestrian
segmentation. Rider segmentation showed similar gains with 1.43% IoU and 2.25%
F1-score improvements. These improved performance results from enhanced
spectral discrimination of optimally selected HSI bands effectively reducing
false positives. This study demonstrates robust pedestrian segmentation through
optimal HSI band selection, showing significant potential for safety-critical
automotive applications.

Motivation: 现有视频时刻检索方法编码所有视频片段（包括无关内容），破坏多模态对齐并阻碍优化。

Method: 提出DRNet，包含文本条件去噪（TCD）和文本重构反馈（TRF）模块，动态识别噪声片段并纯化多模态表示。

Result: 在Charades-STA和QVHighlights数据集上，DRNet在所有指标上超越现有方法。

Conclusion: 去噪后检索范式可适配现有模型，显著提升性能。

Abstract: Current text-driven Video Moment Retrieval (VMR) methods encode all video
clips, including irrelevant ones, disrupting multimodal alignment and hindering
optimization. To this end, we propose a denoise-then-retrieve paradigm that
explicitly filters text-irrelevant clips from videos and then retrieves the
target moment using purified multimodal representations. Following this
paradigm, we introduce the Denoise-then-Retrieve Network (DRNet), comprising
Text-Conditioned Denoising (TCD) and Text-Reconstruction Feedback (TRF)
modules. TCD integrates cross-attention and structured state space blocks to
dynamically identify noisy clips and produce a noise mask to purify multimodal
video representations. TRF further distills a single query embedding from
purified video representations and aligns it with the text embedding, serving
as auxiliary supervision for denoising during training. Finally, we perform
conditional retrieval using text embeddings on purified video representations
for accurate VMR. Experiments on Charades-STA and QVHighlights demonstrate that
our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods on all metrics. Furthermore,
our denoise-then-retrieve paradigm is adaptable and can be seamlessly
integrated into advanced VMR models to boost performance.

Motivation: 现有VLM在逻辑理解方面存在明显不足，限制了其实际应用的可靠性，因此需要系统诊断和提升。

Method: 提出LogicBench基准测试（含50,000+视觉语言对）和LogicCLIP框架，通过逻辑感知数据生成和多目标对比学习提升VLM逻辑能力。

Result: LogicCLIP在LogicBench上显著优于基线模型，逻辑理解能力提升，同时保持通用视觉语言任务性能。

Conclusion: LogicBench和LogicCLIP为提升VLM逻辑能力提供了重要资源，且逻辑增强不影响通用对齐性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), exemplified by CLIP, have emerged as
foundational for multimodal intelligence. However, their capacity for logical
understanding remains significantly underexplored, resulting in critical
''logical blindspots'' that limit their reliability in practical applications.
To systematically diagnose this, we introduce LogicBench, a comprehensive
benchmark with over 50,000 vision-language pairs across 9 logical categories
and 4 diverse scenarios: images, videos, anomaly detection, and medical
diagnostics. Our evaluation reveals that existing VLMs, even the
state-of-the-art ones, fall at over 40 accuracy points below human performance,
particularly in challenging tasks like Causality and Conditionality,
highlighting their reliance on surface semantics over critical logical
structures. To bridge this gap, we propose LogicCLIP, a novel training
framework designed to boost VLMs' logical sensitivity through advancements in
both data generation and optimization objectives. LogicCLIP utilizes
logic-aware data generation and a contrastive learning strategy that combines
coarse-grained alignment, a fine-grained multiple-choice objective, and a novel
logical structure-aware objective. Extensive experiments demonstrate
LogicCLIP's substantial improvements in logical comprehension across all
LogicBench domains, significantly outperforming baselines. Moreover, LogicCLIP
retains, and often surpasses, competitive performance on general
vision-language benchmarks, demonstrating that the enhanced logical
understanding does not come at the expense of general alignment. We believe
that LogicBench and LogicCLIP will be important resources for advancing VLM
logical capabilities.

Conclusion: DSC-Track通过空间线索一致性和动态更新机制，显著提升了3D多目标跟踪的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: 3D multi-object tracking is a critical and challenging task in the field of
autonomous driving. A common paradigm relies on modeling individual object
motion, e.g., Kalman filters, to predict trajectories. While effective in
simple scenarios, this approach often struggles in crowded environments or with
inaccurate detections, as it overlooks the rich geometric relationships between
objects. This highlights the need to leverage spatial cues. However, existing
geometry-aware methods can be susceptible to interference from irrelevant
objects, leading to ambiguous features and incorrect associations. To address
this, we propose focusing on cue-consistency: identifying and matching stable
spatial patterns over time. We introduce the Dynamic Scene Cue-Consistency
Tracker (DSC-Track) to implement this principle. Firstly, we design a unified
spatiotemporal encoder using Point Pair Features (PPF) to learn discriminative
trajectory embeddings while suppressing interference. Secondly, our
cue-consistency transformer module explicitly aligns consistent feature
representations between historical tracks and current detections. Finally, a
dynamic update mechanism preserves salient spatiotemporal information for
stable online tracking. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Waymo Open
Datasets validate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach. On the
nuScenes benchmark, for instance, our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance, reaching 73.2% and 70.3% AMOTA on the validation and test sets,
respectively.

Motivation: 现有的扩散分类器（DC）存在噪声不稳定性问题，导致分类性能波动大，且需要大量噪声采样以稳定结果，降低了分类速度。本文旨在通过优化噪声来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出NoOp方法，包括频率匹配（优化数据集特定噪声）和空间匹配（训练Meta-Network生成图像特定噪声偏移），以替代随机噪声。

Result: 实验证明NoOp能有效提升扩散分类器的稳定性和分类性能。

Conclusion: NoOp通过优化噪声解决了DC的噪声不稳定性问题，显著提升了分类速度和性能。

Abstract: Although today's pretrained discriminative vision-language models (e.g.,
CLIP) have demonstrated strong perception abilities, such as zero-shot image
classification, they also suffer from the bag-of-words problem and spurious
bias. To mitigate these problems, some pioneering studies leverage powerful
generative models (e.g., pretrained diffusion models) to realize generalizable
image classification, dubbed Diffusion Classifier (DC). Specifically, by
randomly sampling a Gaussian noise, DC utilizes the differences of denoising
effects with different category conditions to classify categories.
Unfortunately, an inherent and notorious weakness of existing DCs is noise
instability: different random sampled noises lead to significant performance
changes. To achieve stable classification performance, existing DCs always
ensemble the results of hundreds of sampled noises, which significantly reduces
the classification speed. To this end, we firstly explore the role of noise in
DC, and conclude that: there are some ``good noises'' that can relieve the
instability. Meanwhile, we argue that these good noises should meet two
principles: Frequency Matching and Spatial Matching. Regarding both principles,
we propose a novel Noise Optimization method to learn matching (i.e., good)
noise for DCs: NoOp. For frequency matching, NoOp first optimizes a
dataset-specific noise: Given a dataset and a timestep t, optimize one randomly
initialized parameterized noise. For Spatial Matching, NoOp trains a
Meta-Network that adopts an image as input and outputs image-specific noise
offset. The sum of optimized noise and noise offset will be used in DC to
replace random noise. Extensive ablations on various datasets demonstrated the
effectiveness of NoOp.

Result: AdaFace将组间TPR差异减少了60%（2.5% vs. 6.3%），光照占剩余偏见的42%。合成数据在跨数据集评估中表现良好（r 0.85）。

Conclusion: GANDiff FR为公平性审计提供了可重复、符合监管的标准，尽管计算开销较高，但能生成更多属性变体，支持透明和可扩展的偏见评估。

Abstract: We introduce GANDiff FR, the first synthetic framework that precisely
controls demographic and environmental factors to measure, explain, and reduce
bias with reproducible rigor. GANDiff FR unifies StyleGAN3-based
identity-preserving generation with diffusion-based attribute control, enabling
fine-grained manipulation of pose around 30 degrees, illumination (four
directions), and expression (five levels) under ceteris paribus conditions. We
synthesize 10,000 demographically balanced faces across five cohorts validated
for realism via automated detection (98.2%) and human review (89%) to isolate
and quantify bias drivers. Benchmarking ArcFace, CosFace, and AdaFace under
matched operating points shows AdaFace reduces inter-group TPR disparity by 60%
(2.5% vs. 6.3%), with illumination accounting for 42% of residual bias.
Cross-dataset evaluation on RFW, BUPT, and CASIA WebFace confirms strong
synthetic-to-real transfer (r 0.85). Despite around 20% computational overhead
relative to pure GANs, GANDiff FR yields three times more attribute-conditioned
variants, establishing a reproducible, regulation-aligned (EU AI Act) standard
for fairness auditing. Code and data are released to support transparent,
scalable bias evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在基于transformer的IOD任务中，传统的匈牙利匹配方法可能导致知识遗忘，因为查询在不同迭代中可能匹配不同的旧查询，从而破坏旧类别的知识编码。

Method: 提出IAQD方法，通过索引对齐的方式建立新旧模型查询的对应关系，并仅对关键查询进行蒸馏，以保留旧类别的语义和空间编码能力。

Result: 实验表明，IAQD有效缓解了知识遗忘问题，并在多个基准测试中取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: IAQD为基于transformer的IOD任务提供了一种更有效的知识蒸馏方法，显著提升了模型的持续学习能力。

Abstract: Incremental object detection (IOD) aims to continuously expand the capability
of a model to detect novel categories while preserving its performance on
previously learned ones. When adopting a transformer-based detection model to
perform IOD, catastrophic knowledge forgetting may inevitably occur, meaning
the detection performance on previously learned categories may severely
degenerate. Previous typical methods mainly rely on knowledge distillation (KD)
to mitigate the catastrophic knowledge forgetting of transformer-based
detection models. Specifically, they utilize Hungarian Matching to build a
correspondence between the queries of the last-phase and current-phase
detection models and align the classifier and regressor outputs between matched
queries to avoid knowledge forgetting. However, we observe that in IOD task,
Hungarian Matching is not a good choice. With Hungarian Matching, the query of
the current-phase model may match different queries of the last-phase model at
different iterations during KD. As a result, the knowledge encoded in each
query may be reshaped towards new categories, leading to the forgetting of
previously encoded knowledge of old categories. Based on our observations, we
propose a new distillation approach named Index-Aligned Query Distillation
(IAQD) for transformer-based IOD. Beyond using Hungarian Matching, IAQD
establishes a correspondence between queries of the previous and current phase
models that have the same index. Moreover, we perform index-aligned
distillation only on partial queries which are critical for the detection of
previous categories. In this way, IAQD largely preserves the previous semantic
and spatial encoding capabilities without interfering with the learning of new
categories. Extensive experiments on representative benchmarks demonstrate that
IAQD effectively mitigates knowledge forgetting, achieving new state-of-the-art
performance.

Abstract: Information on the number and category of cervical cells is crucial for the
diagnosis of cervical cancer. However, existing classification methods capable
of automatically measuring this information require the training dataset to be
representative, which consumes an expensive or even unaffordable human cost. We
herein propose active labeling that enables us to construct a representative
training dataset using a much smaller human cost for data-efficient cervical
cell classification. This cost-effective method efficiently leverages the
classifier's uncertainty on the unlabeled cervical cell images to accurately
select images that are most beneficial to label. With a fast estimation of the
uncertainty, this new algorithm exhibits its validity and effectiveness in
enhancing the representative ability of the constructed training dataset. The
extensive empirical results confirm its efficacy again in navigating the usage
of human cost, opening the avenue for data-efficient cervical cell
classification.

Abstract: In targeted adversarial attacks on vision models, the selection of the target
label is a critical yet often overlooked determinant of attack success. This
target label corresponds to the class that the attacker aims to force the model
to predict. Now, existing strategies typically rely on randomness, model
predictions, or static semantic resources, limiting interpretability,
reproducibility, or flexibility. This paper then proposes a semantics-guided
framework for adversarial target selection using the cross-modal knowledge
transfer from pretrained language and vision-language models. We evaluate
several state-of-the-art models (BERT, TinyLLAMA, and CLIP) as similarity
sources to select the most and least semantically related labels with respect
to the ground truth, forming best- and worst-case adversarial scenarios. Our
experiments on three vision models and five attack methods reveal that these
models consistently render practical adversarial targets and surpass static
lexical databases, such as WordNet, particularly for distant class
relationships. We also observe that static testing of target labels offers a
preliminary assessment of the effectiveness of similarity sources, \textit{a
priori} testing. Our results corroborate the suitability of pretrained models
for constructing interpretable, standardized, and scalable adversarial
benchmarks across architectures and datasets.

Conclusion: HOID-R1通过多模态对齐和推理监督，显著提升了HOI检测的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Understanding and recognizing human-object interaction (HOI) is a pivotal
application in AR/VR and robotics. Recent open-vocabulary HOI detection
approaches depend exclusively on large language models for richer textual
prompts, neglecting their inherent 3D spatial understanding capabilities. To
address this shortcoming, we introduce HOID-R1, the first HOI detection
framework that integrates chain-of-thought (CoT) guided supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) within a reinforcement
learning (RL) paradigm. Specifically, we initially apply SFT to imbue the model
with essential reasoning capabilities, forcing the model to articulate its
thought process in the output. Subsequently, we integrate GRPO to leverage
multi-reward signals for policy optimization, thereby enhancing alignment
across diverse modalities. To mitigate hallucinations in the CoT reasoning, we
introduce an "MLLM-as-a-judge" mechanism that supervises the CoT outputs,
further improving generalization. Extensive experiments show that HOID-R1
achieves state-of-the-art performance on HOI detection benchmarks and
outperforms existing methods in open-world generalization to novel scenarios.

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation is crucial for optimizing face recognition models for
deployment in computationally limited settings, such as edge devices.
Traditional KD methods, such as Raw L2 Feature Distillation or Feature
Consistency loss, often fail to capture both fine-grained instance-level
details and complex relational structures, leading to suboptimal performance.
We propose a unified approach that integrates two novel loss functions,
Instance-Level Embedding Distillation and Relation-Based Pairwise Similarity
Distillation. Instance-Level Embedding Distillation focuses on aligning
individual feature embeddings by leveraging a dynamic hard mining strategy,
thereby enhancing learning from challenging examples. Relation-Based Pairwise
Similarity Distillation captures relational information through pairwise
similarity relationships, employing a memory bank mechanism and a sample mining
strategy. This unified framework ensures both effective instance-level
alignment and preservation of geometric relationships between samples, leading
to a more comprehensive distillation process. Our unified framework outperforms
state-of-the-art distillation methods across multiple benchmark face
recognition datasets, as demonstrated by extensive experimental evaluations.
Interestingly, when using strong teacher networks compared to the student, our
unified KD enables the student to even surpass the teacher's accuracy.

Method: 采用轻量级循环框架，仅需两帧输入，结合多尺度特征编码和时序扭曲模块。

Result: 在SSIM上提升近9%，推理速度提高四倍以上。

Conclusion: RMFAT在清晰度恢复和实时性能上均优于现有方法，适合实时应用。

Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence severely degrades video quality by introducing
distortions such as geometric warping, blur, and temporal flickering, posing
significant challenges to both visual clarity and temporal consistency. Current
state-of-the-art methods are based on transformer and 3D architectures and
require multi-frame input, but their large computational cost and memory usage
limit real-time deployment, especially in resource-constrained scenarios. In
this work, we propose RMFAT: Recurrent Multi-scale Feature Atmospheric
Turbulence Mitigator, designed for efficient and temporally consistent video
restoration under AT conditions. RMFAT adopts a lightweight recurrent framework
that restores each frame using only two inputs at a time, significantly
reducing temporal window size and computational burden. It further integrates
multi-scale feature encoding and decoding with temporal warping modules at both
encoder and decoder stages to enhance spatial detail and temporal coherence.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world atmospheric turbulence
datasets demonstrate that RMFAT not only outperforms existing methods in terms
of clarity restoration (with nearly a 9\% improvement in SSIM) but also
achieves significantly improved inference speed (more than a fourfold reduction
in runtime), making it particularly suitable for real-time atmospheric
turbulence suppression tasks.

introducing L2-SP regularization and label-free stopping criteria. We evaluate
our method on the LiveCell and TissueNet datasets, demonstrating relative
improvements in AP0.5 of up to 29.64% over baseline Cellpose. Additionally, we
show that our unsupervised adaptation can further improve models that were
previously fine-tuned with supervision. We release SelfAdapt as an easy-to-use
extension of the Cellpose framework. The code for our method is publicly
available at https: //github.com/Kainmueller-Lab/self_adapt.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文研究了多模态生物特征模板尺寸缩减对性能的影响，通过降维和加密处理，实现了高效且安全的生物识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物识别广泛应用，但模板隐私和安全性是关键问题。多模态融合和加密处理带来计算挑战，需平衡效率和安全性。

Method: 利用深度神经网络提取特征，结合降维和同态加密技术，评估多模态融合对模板尺寸和性能的影响。

Result: 多模态融合可将模板尺寸减少67%，同时保持或超越单模态识别的准确性和安全性。

Conclusion: 降维和加密处理的多模态融合是高效且安全的生物识别解决方案。

Abstract: Biometric recognition is widely used, making the privacy and security of
extracted templates a critical concern. Biometric Template Protection schemes,
especially those utilizing Homomorphic Encryption, introduce significant
computational challenges due to increased workload. Recent advances in deep
neural networks have enabled state-of-the-art feature extraction for face,
fingerprint, and iris modalities. The ubiquity and affordability of biometric
sensors further facilitate multi-modal fusion, which can enhance security by
combining features from different modalities. This work investigates the
biometric performance of reduced multi-biometric template sizes. Experiments
are conducted on an in-house virtual multi-biometric database, derived from
DNN-extracted features for face, fingerprint, and iris, using the FRGC, MCYT,
and CASIA databases. The evaluated approaches are (i) explainable and
straightforward to implement under encryption, (ii) training-free, and (iii)
capable of generalization. Dimensionality reduction of feature vectors leads to
fewer operations in the Homomorphic Encryption (HE) domain, enabling more
efficient encrypted processing while maintaining biometric accuracy and
security at a level equivalent to or exceeding single-biometric recognition.
Our results demonstrate that, by fusing feature vectors from multiple
modalities, template size can be reduced by 67 % with no loss in Equal Error
Rate (EER) compared to the best-performing single modality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶需要丰富的上下文理解和精确的预测推理，而VLM和DWM分别擅长行为预测和场景生成，但两者的结合尚未充分研究。

Method: 提出ImagiDrive框架，将VLM驱动的驾驶代理与DWM驱动的场景想象器结合，形成迭代的规划循环，并引入早期停止机制和轨迹选择策略以提高效率。

Result: 在nuScenes和NAVSIM数据集上的实验表明，ImagiDrive在开环和闭环条件下均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ImagiDrive通过整合VLM和DWM的优势，显著提升了自动驾驶系统的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires rich contextual comprehension and precise
predictive reasoning to navigate dynamic and complex environments safely.
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Driving World Models (DWMs) have
independently emerged as powerful recipes addressing different aspects of this
challenge. VLMs provide interpretability and robust action prediction through
their ability to understand multi-modal context, while DWMs excel in generating
detailed and plausible future driving scenarios essential for proactive
planning. Integrating VLMs with DWMs is an intuitive, promising, yet
understudied strategy to exploit the complementary strengths of accurate
behavioral prediction and realistic scene generation. Nevertheless, this
integration presents notable challenges, particularly in effectively connecting
action-level decisions with high-fidelity pixel-level predictions and
maintaining computational efficiency. In this paper, we propose ImagiDrive, a
novel end-to-end autonomous driving framework that integrates a VLM-based
driving agent with a DWM-based scene imaginer to form a unified
imagination-and-planning loop. The driving agent predicts initial driving
trajectories based on multi-modal inputs, guiding the scene imaginer to
generate corresponding future scenarios. These imagined scenarios are
subsequently utilized to iteratively refine the driving agent's planning
decisions. To address efficiency and predictive accuracy challenges inherent in
this integration, we introduce an early stopping mechanism and a trajectory
selection strategy. Extensive experimental validation on the nuScenes and
NAVSIM datasets demonstrates the robustness and superiority of ImagiDrive over
previous alternatives under both open-loop and closed-loop conditions.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种评估3D高斯泼溅中物体移除后语义残留的新基准和框架，并发布了Remove360数据集。实验表明当前方法在视觉几何缺失时仍能保留语义信息，但存在局限性。

Motivation: 研究物体移除后语义信息的残留问题，对隐私保护的3D重建和可编辑场景表示至关重要。

Method: 引入新基准和评估框架，通过Remove360数据集（包含移除前后的RGB图像和物体级掩码）进行实验。

Result: 当前方法在移除物体后仍能保留语义信息，但存在显著局限性。

Conclusion: 需开发更鲁棒的解决方案以应对真实世界的复杂性。

Abstract: Understanding what semantic information persists after object removal is
critical for privacy-preserving 3D reconstruction and editable scene
representations. In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark and evaluation
framework to measure semantic residuals, the unintended semantic traces left
behind, after object removal in 3D Gaussian Splatting. We conduct experiments
across a diverse set of indoor and outdoor scenes, showing that current methods
can preserve semantic information despite the absence of visual geometry. We
also release Remove360, a dataset of pre/post-removal RGB images and
object-level masks captured in real-world environments. While prior datasets
have focused on isolated object instances, Remove360 covers a broader and more
complex range of indoor and outdoor scenes, enabling evaluation of object
removal in the context of full-scene representations. Given ground truth images
of a scene before and after object removal, we assess whether we can truly
eliminate semantic presence, and if downstream models can still infer what was
removed. Our findings reveal critical limitations in current 3D object removal
techniques and underscore the need for more robust solutions capable of
handling real-world complexity. The evaluation framework is available at
github.com/spatial-intelligence-ai/Remove360.git. Data are available at

Result: 实验表明，MM-R1在零样本条件下生成具有高主题保真度和强文本对齐的个性化图像。

Conclusion: MM-R1为统一MLLMs的个性化图像生成提供了一种高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with unified architectures excel
across a wide range of vision-language tasks, yet aligning them with
personalized image generation remains a significant challenge. Existing methods
for MLLMs are frequently subject-specific, demanding a data-intensive
fine-tuning process for every new subject, which limits their scalability. In
this paper, we introduce MM-R1, a framework that integrates a cross-modal
Chain-of-Thought (X-CoT) reasoning strategy to unlock the inherent potential of
unified MLLMs for personalized image generation. Specifically, we structure
personalization as an integrated visual reasoning and generation process: (1)
grounding subject concepts by interpreting and understanding user-provided
images and contextual cues, and (2) generating personalized images conditioned
on both the extracted subject representations and user prompts. To further
enhance the reasoning capability, we adopt Grouped Reward Proximal Policy
Optimization (GRPO) to explicitly align the generation. Experiments demonstrate
that MM-R1 unleashes the personalization capability of unified MLLMs to
generate images with high subject fidelity and strong text alignment in a
zero-shot manner.

Motivation: 传统监督深度学习方法需要大量标注，而少样本学习难以捕捉精细结构，因此需要一种高效且精确的解决方案。

Method: CoFi通过轻量级网络生成粗分割掩码，再利用形态学修剪生成高质量点提示，引导SAM模型进行精细分割。

Result: Dice系数达74.54%，推理速度为1.9 FPS，显著减轻标注和计算负担。

Conclusion: CoFi高效且精确，适用于肾病理学研究和临床应用。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) in electron
microscopy (EM) images is fundamental for quantifying membrane thickness and
supporting the diagnosis of various kidney diseases. While supervised deep
learning approaches achieve high segmentation accuracy, their reliance on
extensive pixel-level annotation renders them impractical for clinical
workflows. Few-shot learning can reduce this annotation burden but often
struggles to capture the fine structural details necessary for GBM analysis. In
this study, we introduce CoFi, a fast and efficient coarse-to-fine few-shot
segmentation pipeline designed for GBM delineation in EM images. CoFi first
trains a lightweight neural network using only three annotated images to
produce an initial coarse segmentation mask. This mask is then automatically
processed to generate high-quality point prompts with morphology-aware pruning,
which are subsequently used to guide SAM in refining the segmentation. The
proposed method achieved exceptional GBM segmentation performance, with a Dice
coefficient of 74.54% and an inference speed of 1.9 FPS. We demonstrate that
CoFi not only alleviates the annotation and computational burdens associated
with conventional methods, but also achieves accurate and reliable segmentation
results. The pipeline's speed and annotation efficiency make it well-suited for
research and hold strong potential for clinical applications in renal
pathology. The pipeline is publicly available at:

Abstract: Abnormal Human Behavior Detection (AHBD) under special scenarios is becoming
increasingly crucial. While YOLO-based detection methods excel in real-time
tasks, they remain hindered by challenges including small objects, task

Attention Module to enhance small object detection, a Task-Aware Attention
Module to deal with classification-regression conflicts, and a Strengthen Neck
Network for refined multi-scale fusion, respectively. In addition, we optimize
Anchor Box sizes using K-means clustering and deploy DIoU-Loss to improve
bounding box regression. The Personnel Anomalous Behavior Detection (PABD)
dataset, which includes 8,529 samples across four behavior categories, is also
presented. Extensive experimental results indicate that TACR-YOLO achieves
91.92% mAP on PABD, with competitive speed and robustness. Ablation studies
highlight the contribution of each improvement. This work provides new insights
for abnormal behavior detection under special scenarios, advancing its
progress.

Abstract: The construction industry increasingly relies on visual data to support
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) applications for site
monitoring. High-quality, domain-specific datasets, comprising images, videos,
and point clouds, capture site geometry and spatiotemporal dynamics, including
the location and interaction of objects, workers, and materials. However,
despite growing interest in leveraging visual datasets, existing resources vary
widely in sizes, data modalities, annotation quality, and representativeness of
real-world construction conditions. A systematic review to categorize their
data characteristics and application contexts is still lacking, limiting the
community's ability to fully understand the dataset landscape, identify
critical gaps, and guide future directions toward more effective, reliable, and
scalable AI applications in construction. To address this gap, this study
conducts an extensive search of academic databases and open-data platforms,
yielding 51 publicly available visual datasets that span the 2005-2024 period.
These datasets are categorized using a structured data schema covering (i) data
fundamentals (e.g., size and license), (ii) data modalities (e.g., RGB and
point cloud), (iii) annotation frameworks (e.g., bounding boxes), and (iv)
downstream application domains (e.g., progress tracking). This study
synthesizes these findings into an open-source catalog, OpenConstruction,
supporting data-driven method development. Furthermore, the study discusses
several critical limitations in the existing construction dataset landscape and
presents a roadmap for future data infrastructure anchored in the Findability,
Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability (FAIR) principles. By
reviewing the current landscape and outlining strategic priorities, this study
supports the advancement of data-centric solutions in the construction sector.

Result: CineTrans生成的多镜头视频具有电影编辑风格，过渡稳定，实验表明其在各项指标上显著优于基线。

Conclusion: CineTrans为多镜头视频生成提供了有效解决方案，并通过新评估指标验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in video synthesis, research into multi-shot
video generation remains in its infancy. Even with scaled-up models and massive
datasets, the shot transition capabilities remain rudimentary and unstable,
largely confining generated videos to single-shot sequences. In this work, we
introduce CineTrans, a novel framework for generating coherent multi-shot
videos with cinematic, film-style transitions. To facilitate insights into the
film editing style, we construct a multi-shot video-text dataset Cine250K with
detailed shot annotations. Furthermore, our analysis of existing video
diffusion models uncovers a correspondence between attention maps in the
diffusion model and shot boundaries, which we leverage to design a mask-based
control mechanism that enables transitions at arbitrary positions and transfers
effectively in a training-free setting. After fine-tuning on our dataset with
the mask mechanism, CineTrans produces cinematic multi-shot sequences while
adhering to the film editing style, avoiding unstable transitions or naive
concatenations. Finally, we propose specialized evaluation metrics for
transition control, temporal consistency and overall quality, and demonstrate
through extensive experiments that CineTrans significantly outperforms existing
baselines across all criteria.

Novel artificial intelligence tools may improve efficiency in identifying

various aspects of cultural heritage value in fa\c{c}ade images. Using this
data and building register data as features, machine learning models were
trained to classify multi-family and non-residential buildings in Stockholm,
Sweden. Validation against an expert-created inventory shows a macro F1-score
of 0.71 using a combination of register data and features retrieved from GPT,
and a score of 0.60 using only GPT-derived data. The presented methodology can
contribute to a higher-quality database and thus support careful energy
efficiency measures and integrated consideration of heritage value in
large-scale energetic refurbishment scenarios.

Result: 在NAVSIM和Bench2Drive数据集上，VeteranAD实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: VeteranAD通过感知与规划的耦合设计，显著提升了自动驾驶的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has achieved remarkable advancements in recent
years. Existing methods primarily follow a perception-planning paradigm, where
perception and planning are executed sequentially within a fully differentiable
framework for planning-oriented optimization. We further advance this paradigm
through a perception-in-plan framework design, which integrates perception into
the planning process. This design facilitates targeted perception guided by
evolving planning objectives over time, ultimately enhancing planning
performance. Building on this insight, we introduce VeteranAD, a coupled
perception and planning framework for end-to-end autonomous driving. By
incorporating multi-mode anchored trajectories as planning priors, the
perception module is specifically designed to gather traffic elements along
these trajectories, enabling comprehensive and targeted perception. Planning
trajectories are then generated based on both the perception results and the
planning priors. To make perception fully serve planning, we adopt an
autoregressive strategy that progressively predicts future trajectories while
focusing on relevant regions for targeted perception at each step. With this
simple yet effective design, VeteranAD fully unleashes the potential of
planning-oriented end-to-end methods, leading to more accurate and reliable
driving behavior. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM and Bench2Drive datasets
demonstrate that our VeteranAD achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have
  demonstrated strong performance in visual recognition tasks,
  but their inherent reliance on regular grid structures limits
  their capacity to model complex topological relationships and
  non-local semantics within images. To address this limita tion, we propose
the hierarchical graph feature enhancement
  (HGFE), a novel framework that integrates graph-based rea soning into CNNs to
enhance both structural awareness and
  feature representation. HGFE builds two complementary levels
  of graph structures: intra-window graph convolution to cap ture local spatial
dependencies and inter-window supernode
  interactions to model global semantic relationships. Moreover,
  we introduce an adaptive frequency modulation module that
  dynamically balances low-frequency and high-frequency signal
  propagation, preserving critical edge and texture information
  while mitigating over-smoothing. The proposed HGFE module
  is lightweight, end-to-end trainable, and can be seamlessly
  integrated into standard CNN backbone networks. Extensive
  experiments on CIFAR-100 (classification), PASCAL VOC,
  and VisDrone (detection), as well as CrackSeg and CarParts
  (segmentation), validated the effectiveness of the HGFE in
  improving structural representation and enhancing overall
  recognition performance.

Conclusion: AIM通过促进使用真实特征，提升泛化能力和人类对齐的可解释性。

Abstract: It has been observed that deep neural networks (DNNs) often use both genuine
as well as spurious features. In this work, we propose "Amending Inherent
Interpretability via Self-Supervised Masking" (AIM), a simple yet interestingly
effective method that promotes the network's utilization of genuine features
over spurious alternatives without requiring additional annotations. In
particular, AIM uses features at multiple encoding stages to guide a
self-supervised, sample-specific feature-masking process. As a result, AIM
enables the training of well-performing and inherently interpretable models
that faithfully summarize the decision process. We validate AIM across a
diverse range of challenging datasets that test both out-of-distribution
generalization and fine-grained visual understanding. These include
general-purpose classification benchmarks such as ImageNet100, HardImageNet,
and ImageWoof, as well as fine-grained classification datasets such as
Waterbirds, TravelingBirds, and CUB-200. AIM demonstrates significant dual
benefits: interpretability improvements, as measured by the Energy Pointing
Game (EPG) score, and accuracy gains over strong baselines. These consistent
gains across domains and architectures provide compelling evidence that AIM
promotes the use of genuine and meaningful features that directly contribute to
improved generalization and human-aligned interpretability.

Abstract: Accelerated aging of transportation infrastructure in the rapidly developing
Yangtze River Delta region necessitates efficient concrete crack detection, as
crack deterioration critically compromises structural integrity and regional
economic growth. To overcome the limitations of inefficient manual inspection
and the suboptimal performance of existing deep learning models, particularly
for small-target crack detection within complex backgrounds, this paper
proposes YOLOv11-KW-TA-FP, a multi-task concrete crack detection and
segmentation model based on the YOLOv11n architecture. The proposed model
integrates a three-stage optimization framework: (1) Embedding dynamic
KernelWarehouse convolution (KWConv) within the backbone network to enhance
feature representation through a dynamic kernel sharing mechanism; (2)
Incorporating a triple attention mechanism (TA) into the feature pyramid to
strengthen channel-spatial interaction modeling; and (3) Designing an FP-IoU
loss function to facilitate adaptive bounding box regression penalization.
Experimental validation demonstrates that the enhanced model achieves
significant performance improvements over the baseline, attaining 91.3%
precision, 76.6% recall, and 86.4% mAP@50. Ablation studies confirm the
synergistic efficacy of the proposed modules. Furthermore, robustness tests
indicate stable performance under conditions of data scarcity and noise
interference. This research delivers an efficient computer vision solution for
automated infrastructure inspection, exhibiting substantial practical
engineering value.

Result: MST在多个数据集上优于现有高效跟踪器，计算开销仅0.1 GFLOPs和0.66 M参数，AO得分提升4.5%。

Conclusion: MST通过轻量级设计显著提升了跟踪性能，适用于复杂环境。

Abstract: Efficient trackers achieve faster runtime by reducing computational
complexity and model parameters. However, this efficiency often compromises the
expense of weakened feature representation capacity, thus limiting their
ability to accurately capture target states using single-layer features. To
overcome this limitation, we propose Multi-State Tracker (MST), which utilizes
highly lightweight state-specific enhancement (SSE) to perform specialized
enhancement on multi-state features produced by multi-state generation (MSG)
and aggregates them in an interactive and adaptive manner using cross-state
interaction (CSI). This design greatly enhances feature representation while
incurring minimal computational overhead, leading to improved tracking
robustness in complex environments. Specifically, the MSG generates multiple
state representations at multiple stages during feature extraction, while SSE
refines them to highlight target-specific features. The CSI module facilitates
information exchange between these states and ensures the integration of
complementary features. Notably, the introduced SSE and CSI modules adopt a
highly lightweight hidden state adaptation-based state space duality (HSA-SSD)
design, incurring only 0.1 GFLOPs in computation and 0.66 M in parameters.
Experimental results demonstrate that MST outperforms all previous efficient
trackers across multiple datasets, significantly improving tracking accuracy
and robustness. In particular, it shows excellent runtime performance, with an
AO score improvement of 4.5\% over the previous SOTA efficient tracker HCAT on
the GOT-10K dataset. The code is available at https://github.com/wsumel/MST.

Motivation: 解决在计算资源受限环境下高效高精度医学图像分类的挑战。

Result: 在CPU条件下，10个训练周期内测试集分类准确率达89.10%，收敛稳定。

Conclusion: 该方法在资源受限环境中有效提升了医学图像分类性能，为模型部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Intelligent analysis of medical imaging plays a crucial role in assisting
clinical diagnosis. However, achieving efficient and high-accuracy image
classification in resource-constrained computational environments remains
challenging. This study proposes a medical image classification method based on
an improved ConvNeXt-Tiny architecture. Through structural optimization and
loss function design, the proposed method enhances feature extraction
capability and classification performance while reducing computational
complexity. Specifically, the method introduces a dual global pooling (Global
Average Pooling and Global Max Pooling) feature fusion strategy into the
ConvNeXt-Tiny backbone to simultaneously preserve global statistical features
and salient response information. A lightweight channel attention module,
termed Squeeze-and-Excitation Vector (SEVector), is designed to improve the
adaptive allocation of channel weights while minimizing parameter overhead.
Additionally, a Feature Smoothing Loss is incorporated into the loss function
to enhance intra-class feature consistency and suppress intra-class variance.
Under CPU-only conditions (8 threads), the method achieves a maximum
classification accuracy of 89.10% on the test set within 10 training epochs,
exhibiting a stable convergence trend in loss values. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method effectively improves medical image
classification performance in resource-limited settings, providing a feasible
and efficient solution for the deployment and promotion of medical imaging
analysis models.

Motivation: 现有方法在推理时缺乏可解释性且性能不足，无法充分处理时空推理。

Method: 采用Group Relative Policy Optimization（GRPO）和Chain-of-Thought（CoT）初始化训练，结合高质量CoT数据，优化推理链。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到SOTA性能，显著超越现有方法（如ReVOS和ReasonVOS），并减少幻觉现象。

Conclusion: Veason-R1通过结构化推理和强化学习，显著提升了VRS任务的性能与鲁棒性。

Abstract: Video reasoning segmentation (VRS) endeavors to delineate referred objects in
videos guided by implicit instructions that encapsulate human intent and
temporal logic. Previous approaches leverage large vision language models
(LVLMs) to encode object semantics into <SEG> tokens for mask prediction.
However, this paradigm suffers from limited interpretability during inference
and suboptimal performance due to inadequate spatiotemporal reasoning. Drawing
inspiration from seminal breakthroughs in reinforcement learning, we introduce
Veason-R1, a specialized LVLM for VRS that emphasizes structured reasoning in
segmentation. Veason-R1 is trained through Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) augmented with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) initialization. To begin with, we
curate high-quality CoT training data to instill structured reasoning
trajectories, bridging video-level semantics and frame-level spatial grounding,
yielding the supervised fine-tuned model Veason-SFT. Subsequently, GRPO
fine-tuning encourages efficient exploration of the reasoning space by
optimizing reasoning chains. To this end, we incorporate a holistic reward
mechanism that synergistically enhances spatial alignment and temporal
consistency, bolstering keyframe localization and fine-grained grounding.
Comprehensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that Veason-R1 achieves
state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, surpassing prior art by
significant margins (e.g., +1.3 J &F in ReVOS and +10.0 J &F in ReasonVOS),
while exhibiting robustness to hallucinations (+8.8 R). Our code and model
weights will be available at Veason-R1.

Motivation: 工业异常检测中数据稀缺问题突出，现有异常生成方法缺乏保真度或需额外训练数据。

Method: 利用Stable Diffusion，结合文本提示和掩码，提出交叉注意力增强（CAE）和自注意力增强（SAE）机制，生成特定区域的逼真异常。

Result: 在MVTec AD和VisA数据集上验证了AAG的有效性，生成的异常图像能提升下游异常检测任务性能。

Conclusion: AAG为工业异常检测提供了一种高效、无需训练的异常生成解决方案。

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection (AD) plays a significant role in manufacturing
where a long-standing challenge is data scarcity. A growing body of works have
emerged to address insufficient anomaly data via anomaly generation. However,
these anomaly generation methods suffer from lack of fidelity or need to be
trained with extra data. To this end, we propose a training-free anomaly
generation framework dubbed AAG, which is based on Stable Diffusion (SD)'s
strong generation ability for effective anomaly image generation. Given a
normal image, mask and a simple text prompt, AAG can generate realistic and
natural anomalies in the specific regions and simultaneously keep contents in
other regions unchanged. In particular, we propose Cross-Attention Enhancement
(CAE) to re-engineer the cross-attention mechanism within Stable Diffusion
based on the given mask. CAE increases the similarity between visual tokens in
specific regions and text embeddings, which guides these generated visual
tokens in accordance with the text description. Besides, generated anomalies
need to be more natural and plausible with object in given image. We propose
Self-Attention Enhancement (SAE) which improves similarity between each normal
visual token and anomaly visual tokens. SAE ensures that generated anomalies
are coherent with original pattern. Extensive experiments on MVTec AD and VisA
datasets demonstrate effectiveness of AAG in anomaly generation and its
utility. Furthermore, anomaly images generated by AAG can bolster performance
of various downstream anomaly inspection tasks.

Motivation: 体育分析领域存在数据不可用、缺乏有效轨迹框架和标签不足的问题，TrajSV旨在解决这些挑战。

Method: TrajSV包含数据预处理、Clip Representation Network (CRNet)和Video Representation Network (VRNet)三个模块，利用Transformer和编码器-解码器架构学习表示，并通过三重对比损失优化。

Result: 在足球、篮球和排球视频数据集上，TrajSV在视频检索、动作识别和视频字幕任务中表现优异，分别提升了70%、9/17类别最优和20%。

Conclusion: TrajSV通过轨迹框架和无监督学习显著提升了体育视频分析性能，并展示了实际部署系统的可行性。

Abstract: Sports analytics has received significant attention from both academia and
industry in recent years. Despite the growing interest and efforts in this
field, several issues remain unresolved, including (1) data unavailability, (2)
lack of an effective trajectory-based framework, and (3) requirement for
sufficient supervision labels. In this paper, we present TrajSV, a
trajectory-based framework that addresses various issues in existing studies.
TrajSV comprises three components: data preprocessing, Clip Representation
Network (CRNet), and Video Representation Network (VRNet). The data
preprocessing module extracts player and ball trajectories from sports
broadcast videos. CRNet utilizes a trajectory-enhanced Transformer module to
learn clip representations based on these trajectories. Additionally, VRNet
learns video representations by aggregating clip representations and visual
features with an encoder-decoder architecture. Finally, a triple contrastive
loss is introduced to optimize both video and clip representations in an
unsupervised manner. The experiments are conducted on three broadcast video
datasets to verify the effectiveness of TrajSV for three types of sports (i.e.,
soccer, basketball, and volleyball) with three downstream applications (i.e.,
sports video retrieval, action spotting, and video captioning). The results
demonstrate that TrajSV achieves state-of-the-art performance in sports video
retrieval, showcasing a nearly 70% improvement. It outperforms baselines in
action spotting, achieving state-of-the-art results in 9 out of 17 action
categories, and demonstrates a nearly 20% improvement in video captioning.
Additionally, we introduce a deployed system along with the three applications
based on TrajSV.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现，视频语言模型（VideoLMs）中，去除或修改位置编码（PEs）对时间理解性能影响很小，但反转帧序列会显著降低性能。分析表明，时间信息通过帧间注意力逐步合成，最终整合到查询令牌中。基于此，提出了两种效率优化策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索视频语言模型中时间理解的机制，尤其是位置编码的作用，以改进模型性能。

Method: 通过实验分析时间信息的整合路径，提出并验证了两种效率优化策略：分阶段跨模态注意力和时间退出机制。

Result: 实验表明，时间理解主要依赖帧间注意力而非位置编码，提出的策略在基准测试中表现有效。

Conclusion: 时间推理源于帧间令牌交互，位置编码作用有限，提出的策略为未来模型优化提供了方向。

Abstract: Video language models (VideoLMs) have made significant progress in multimodal
understanding. However, temporal understanding, which involves identifying
event order, duration, and relationships across time, still remains a core
challenge. Prior works emphasize positional encodings (PEs) as a key mechanism
for encoding temporal structure. Surprisingly, we find that removing or
modifying PEs in video inputs yields minimal degradation in the performance of
temporal understanding. In contrast, reversing the frame sequence while
preserving the original PEs causes a substantial drop. To explain this
behavior, we conduct substantial analysis experiments to trace how temporal
information is integrated within the model. We uncover a causal information
pathway: temporal cues are progressively synthesized through inter-frame
attention, aggregated in the final frame, and subsequently integrated into the
query tokens. This emergent mechanism shows that temporal reasoning emerges
from inter-visual token interactions under the constraints of causal attention,
which implicitly encodes temporal structure. Based on these insights, we
propose two efficiency-oriented strategies: staged cross-modal attention and a
temporal exit mechanism for early token truncation. Experiments on two
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of both approaches. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work to systematically investigate video temporal
understanding in VideoLMs, offering insights for future model improvement.

Conclusion: 该框架为城市植被和基础设施监测提供了实时、低成本且高效的解决方案，适用于公用事业公司和城市规划者。

Abstract: Our study introduces a novel, low-cost, and reproducible framework for
real-time, object-level structural assessment and geolocation of roadside
vegetation and infrastructure with commonly available but underutilized
dashboard camera (dashcam) video data. We developed an end-to-end pipeline that
combines monocular depth estimation, depth error correction, and geometric
triangulation to generate accurate spatial and structural data from
street-level video streams from vehicle-mounted dashcams. Depth maps were first
estimated using a state-of-the-art monocular depth model, then refined via a
gradient-boosted regression framework to correct underestimations, particularly
for distant objects. The depth correction model achieved strong predictive
performance (R2 = 0.92, MAE = 0.31 on transformed scale), significantly
reducing bias beyond 15 m. Further, object locations were estimated using
GPS-based triangulation, while object heights were calculated using pin hole
camera geometry. Our method was evaluated under varying conditions of camera
placement and vehicle speed. Low-speed vehicle with inside camera gave the
highest accuracy, with mean geolocation error of 2.83 m, and mean absolute
error (MAE) in height estimation of 2.09 m for trees and 0.88 m for poles. To
the best of our knowledge, it is the first framework to combine monocular depth
modeling, triangulated GPS-based geolocation, and real-time structural
assessment for urban vegetation and infrastructure using consumer-grade video
data. Our approach complements conventional RS methods, such as LiDAR and image
by offering a fast, real-time, and cost-effective solution for object-level
monitoring of vegetation risks and infrastructure exposure, making it
especially valuable for utility companies, and urban planners aiming for
scalable and frequent assessments in dynamic urban environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多视图信息交换上缺乏显式控制，导致编辑结果模糊且不一致。

Method: 提出CoreEditor框架，结合对应约束注意力机制和语义相似性建模，实现多视图一致性编辑，并提供选择性编辑流程。

Result: 实验表明，CoreEditor能生成高质量、3D一致的编辑结果，细节更清晰，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CoreEditor通过创新的注意力机制和用户交互设计，显著提升了文本驱动3D编辑的效果和灵活性。

Abstract: Text-driven 3D editing seeks to modify 3D scenes according to textual
descriptions, and most existing approaches tackle this by adapting pre-trained
2D image editors to multi-view inputs. However, without explicit control over
multi-view information exchange, they often fail to maintain cross-view
consistency, leading to insufficient edits and blurry details. We introduce
CoreEditor, a novel framework for consistent text-to-3D editing. The key
innovation is a correspondence-constrained attention mechanism that enforces
precise interactions between pixels expected to remain consistent throughout
the diffusion denoising process. Beyond relying solely on geometric alignment,
we further incorporate semantic similarity estimated during denoising, enabling
more reliable correspondence modeling and robust multi-view editing. In
addition, we design a selective editing pipeline that allows users to choose
preferred results from multiple candidates, offering greater flexibility and
user control. Extensive experiments show that CoreEditor produces high-quality,
3D-consistent edits with sharper details, significantly outperforming prior
methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多LoRA组合时表现不佳，尤其是在开放环境中。

Method: 在潜在空间中划分空间块，计算噪声预测的余弦相似度，构建空间感知权重矩阵，加权聚合LoRA输出。

Result: ClipScore提升1.3%，GPT-4V评估胜率72.43%，适用于多种潜在扩散模型。

Conclusion: LoRAtorio在多LoRA组合中表现优异，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a widely adopted technique in
text-to-image diffusion models, enabling the personalisation of visual concepts
such as characters, styles, and objects. However, existing approaches struggle
to effectively compose multiple LoRA adapters, particularly in open-ended
settings where the number and nature of required skills are not known in
advance. In this work, we present LoRAtorio, a novel train-free framework for
multi-LoRA composition that leverages intrinsic model behaviour. Our method is
motivated by two key observations: (1) LoRA adapters trained on narrow domains
produce denoised outputs that diverge from the base model, and (2) when
operating out-of-distribution, LoRA outputs show behaviour closer to the base
model than when conditioned in distribution. The balance between these two
observations allows for exceptional performance in the single LoRA scenario,
which nevertheless deteriorates when multiple LoRAs are loaded. Our method
operates in the latent space by dividing it into spatial patches and computing
cosine similarity between each patch's predicted noise and that of the base
model. These similarities are used to construct a spatially-aware weight
matrix, which guides a weighted aggregation of LoRA outputs. To address domain
drift, we further propose a modification to classifier-free guidance that
incorporates the base model's unconditional score into the composition. We
extend this formulation to a dynamic module selection setting, enabling
inference-time selection of relevant LoRA adapters from a large pool. LoRAtorio
achieves state-of-the-art performance, showing up to a 1.3% improvement in
ClipScore and a 72.43% win rate in GPT-4V pairwise evaluations, and generalises
effectively to multiple latent diffusion models.

Motivation: 现有开源模型在图像处理和逻辑推理能力上不如专有模型（如O3），Thyme旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用两阶段训练策略：先通过SFT训练代码生成能力，再通过RL优化决策，并提出GRPO-ATS算法平衡推理探索与代码执行精度。

Result: 在近20个基准测试中，Thyme在感知和复杂推理任务上表现显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Thyme为MLLMs提供了一种自主生成和执行代码的新方法，显著提升了图像处理和推理能力。

Abstract: Following OpenAI's introduction of the ``thinking with images'' concept,
recent efforts have explored stimulating the use of visual information in the
reasoning process to enhance model performance in perception and reasoning
tasks. However, to the best of our knowledge, no open-source work currently
offers a feature set as rich as proprietary models (O3), which can perform
diverse image manipulations and simultaneously enhance logical reasoning
capabilities through code. In this paper, we make a preliminary attempt in this
direction by introducing Thyme (Think Beyond Images), a novel paradigm for
enabling MLLMs to transcend existing ``think with images'' approaches by
autonomously generating and executing diverse image processing and
computational operations via executable code. This approach not only
facilitates a rich, on-the-fly set of image manipulations (e.g., cropping,
rotation, contrast enhancement) but also allows for mathematical computations,
all while maintaining high autonomy in deciding when and how to apply these
operations. We activate this capability through a two-stage training strategy:
an initial SFT on a curated dataset of 500K samples to teach code generation,
followed by a RL phase to refine decision-making. For the RL stage, we manually
collect and design high-resolution question-answer pairs to increase the
learning difficulty, and we propose GRPO-ATS (Group Relative Policy
Optimization with Adaptive Temperature Sampling), an algorithm that applies
distinct temperatures to text and code generation to balance reasoning
exploration with code execution precision. We conduct extensive experimental
analysis and ablation studies. Comprehensive evaluations on nearly 20
benchmarks show that Thyme yields significant and consistent performance gains,
particularly in challenging high-resolution perception and complex reasoning
tasks.

Conclusion: A2HCoder通过模块化和逐步翻译有效减少了LLM生成代码的幻觉问题，提升了算法到硬件翻译的效率和可靠性。

Abstract: In wireless communication systems, stringent requirements such as ultra-low
latency and power consumption have significantly increased the demand for
efficient algorithm-to-hardware deployment. However, a persistent and
substantial gap remains between algorithm design and hardware implementation.
Bridging this gap traditionally requires extensive domain expertise and
time-consuming manual development, due to fundamental mismatches between
high-level programming languages like MATLAB and hardware description languages
(HDLs) such as Verilog-in terms of memory access patterns, data processing
manners, and datatype representations. To address this challenge, we propose
A2HCoder: a Hierarchical Algorithm-to-HDL Coding Agent, powered by large
language models (LLMs), designed to enable agile and reliable
algorithm-to-hardware translation. A2HCoder introduces a hierarchical framework
that enhances both robustness and interpretability while suppressing common
hallucination issues in LLM-generated code. In the horizontal dimension,
A2HCoder decomposes complex algorithms into modular functional blocks,
simplifying code generation and improving consistency. In the vertical
dimension, instead of relying on end-to-end generation, A2HCoder performs
step-by-step, fine-grained translation, leveraging external toolchains such as
MATLAB and Vitis HLS for debugging and circuit-level synthesis. This structured
process significantly mitigates hallucinations and ensures hardware-level
correctness. We validate A2HCoder through a real-world deployment case in the
5G wireless communication domain, demonstrating its practicality, reliability,
and deployment efficiency.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) afford new possibilities for user modeling

multidimensional nuances of individual users. In this work, we introduce
PersonaTwin, a multi-tier prompt conditioning framework that builds adaptive
digital twins by integrating demographic, behavioral, and psychometric data.
Using a comprehensive data set in the healthcare context of more than 8,500
individuals, we systematically benchmark PersonaTwin against standard LLM
outputs, and our rigorous evaluation unites state-of-the-art text similarity
metrics with dedicated demographic parity assessments, ensuring that generated

framework produces simulation fidelity on par with oracle settings. Moreover,
downstream models trained on persona-twins approximate models trained on
individuals in terms of prediction and fairness metrics across both
GPT-4o-based and Llama-based models. Together, these findings underscore the
potential for LLM digital twin-based approaches in producing realistic and
emotionally nuanced user simulations, offering a powerful tool for personalized

Motivation: 识别公司风险因素对投资者和金融市场的健康至关重要。

Method: 研究构建了一个包含七个方面的风险因素分类框架，标注了744篇新闻文章，并测试了多种机器学习模型，包括零样本和小样本提示的LLMs以及微调的预训练语言模型。

Result: 实验表明，零样本和小样本提示的LLMs表现一般，而微调的预训练语言模型在大多数风险因素上表现更好。研究还分析了27.7万篇彭博新闻文章。

Conclusion: 从新闻中识别风险因素可以为公司和行业的运营提供深入见解。

Abstract: Identifying risks associated with a company is important to investors and the
well-being of the overall financial market. In this study, we build a
computational framework to automatically extract company risk factors from news
articles. Our newly proposed schema comprises seven distinct aspects, such as
supply chain, regulations, and competitions. We sample and annotate 744 news
articles and benchmark various machine learning models. While large language
models have achieved huge progress in various types of NLP tasks, our
experiment shows that zero-shot and few-shot prompting state-of-the-art LLMs
(e.g. LLaMA-2) can only achieve moderate to low performances in identifying
risk factors. And fine-tuned pre-trained language models are performing better
on most of the risk factors. Using this model, we analyze over 277K Bloomberg
news articles and demonstrate that identifying risk factors from news could
provide extensive insight into the operations of companies and industries.

TL;DR: Rule2Text框架利用大语言模型为知识图谱的逻辑规则生成自然语言解释，提升可理解性和可用性。通过多数据集实验和人类评估，优化模型性能，并构建高质量数据集用于微调开源模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识图谱的逻辑规则因复杂性和标签习惯难以理解，需提升其可解释性和可用性。

Method: 使用AMIE 3.5.1挖掘规则，结合多种提示策略评估LLMs，开发LLM-as-a-judge框架，并通过人类反馈微调Zephyr模型。

Result: 微调后解释质量显著提升，尤其在特定领域数据集表现突出。

Conclusion: Rule2Text有效提升知识图谱规则的可解释性，支持类型推断模块，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) can be enhanced through rule mining; however, the
resulting logical rules are often difficult for humans to interpret due to
their inherent complexity and the idiosyncratic labeling conventions of
individual KGs. This work presents Rule2Text, a comprehensive framework that
leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate natural language
explanations for mined logical rules, thereby improving KG accessibility and
usability. We conduct extensive experiments using multiple datasets, including
Freebase variants (FB-CVT-REV, FB+CVT-REV, and FB15k-237) as well as the
ogbl-biokg dataset, with rules mined using AMIE 3.5.1. We systematically
evaluate several LLMs across a comprehensive range of prompting strategies,
including zero-shot, few-shot, variable type incorporation, and
Chain-of-Thought reasoning. To systematically assess models' performance, we
conduct a human evaluation of generated explanations on correctness and
clarity. To address evaluation scalability, we develop and validate an
LLM-as-a-judge framework that demonstrates strong agreement with human
evaluators. Leveraging the best-performing model (Gemini 2.0 Flash), LLM judge,
and human-in-the-loop feedback, we construct high-quality ground truth
datasets, which we use to fine-tune the open-source Zephyr model. Our results
demonstrate significant improvements in explanation quality after fine-tuning,
with particularly strong gains in the domain-specific dataset. Additionally, we
integrate a type inference module to support KGs lacking explicit type
information. All code and data are publicly available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MDMs（掩码扩散语言模型）因其可扩展性和易训练性成为离散数据的先进非自回归生成框架。本文提出了一种基于验证器的推理时间扩展方法，显著提升生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何通过推理时间扩展（如增加去噪步骤或使用验证器）提升MDMs的生成质量。

Method: 提出基于验证器的推理时间扩展方法，结合预训练嵌入模型优化生成候选。

Result: 实验表明，MDMs在文本风格转换任务中优于自回归模型，且验证器设置显著提升生成质量。

Conclusion: MDMs结合验证器是一种高效的非自回归生成方法，适用于离散数据任务。

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDMs) have recently gained traction as a
viable generative framework for natural language. This can be attributed to its
scalability and ease of training compared to other diffusion model paradigms
for discrete data, establishing itself as the state-of-the-art
non-autoregressive generator for discrete data. Diffusion models, in general,
have shown excellent ability to improve the generation quality by leveraging
inference-time scaling either by increasing the number of denoising steps or by
using external verifiers on top of the outputs of each step to guide the
generation. In this work, we propose a verifier-based inference-time scaling
method that aids in finding a better candidate generation during the denoising
process of the MDM. Our experiments demonstrate the application of MDMs for
standard text-style transfer tasks and establish MDMs as a better alternative
to autoregressive language models. Additionally, we show that a simple
soft-value-based verifier setup for MDMs using off-the-shelf pre-trained
embedding models leads to significant gains in generation quality even when
used on top of typical classifier-free guidance setups in the existing
literature.

Result: 发现显著安全漏洞，揭示了安全与风险预防之间的相关性，以及交互性与年龄适宜性的负相关。

Conclusion: 研究结果为儿童中心AI设计和部署提供了实用指南。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) in applications
targeting children and adolescents necessitates a fundamental reassessment of
prevailing AI safety frameworks, which are largely tailored to adult users and
neglect the distinct developmental vulnerabilities of minors. This paper
highlights key deficiencies in existing LLM safety benchmarks, including their
inadequate coverage of age-specific cognitive, emotional, and social risks
spanning early childhood (ages 0--6), middle childhood (7--12), and adolescence
(13--18). To bridge these gaps, we introduce SproutBench, an innovative
evaluation suite comprising 1,283 developmentally grounded adversarial prompts
designed to probe risks such as emotional dependency, privacy violations, and
imitation of hazardous behaviors. Through rigorous empirical evaluation of 47
diverse LLMs, we uncover substantial safety vulnerabilities, corroborated by
robust inter-dimensional correlations (e.g., between Safety and Risk
Prevention) and a notable inverse relationship between Interactivity and Age
Appropriateness. These insights yield practical guidelines for advancing
child-centric AI design and deployment.

Conclusion: 通过调控数据分布和分词方法可改善跨语言迁移，为改进大型语言模型提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) struggle with cross-lingual knowledge transfer:
they hallucinate when asked in one language about facts expressed in a
different language during training. This work introduces a controlled setting
to study the causes and dynamics of this phenomenon by training small
Transformer models from scratch on synthetic multilingual datasets. We identify
a learning phase wherein a model develops either separate or unified
representations of the same facts across languages, and show that unification
is essential for cross-lingual transfer. We also show that the degree of
unification depends on mutual information between facts and training data
language, and on how easy it is to extract that language. Based on these
insights, we develop methods to modulate the level of cross-lingual transfer by
manipulating data distribution and tokenization, and we introduce metrics and
visualizations to formally characterize their effects on unification. Our work
shows how controlled settings can shed light on pre-training dynamics and
suggests new directions for improving cross-lingual transfer in LLMs.

TL;DR: 论文研究了语言模型代理在复杂任务中面对外部失败时的备份计划能力，发现现有模型难以适应环境反馈并调整策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型代理应用于更复杂的现实问题，需要其在计划失败时能有效搜索替代方案。

Method: 设计了一个专门的规划基准测试，通过函数调用组合解决问题，并引入外部失败（如函数不可用）以测试代理的适应性。

Result: 研究发现，即使搜索空间受限，语言模型代理仍难以适应环境反馈并执行备用计划。

Conclusion: 当前生成模型在应对动态环境时存在挑战，未来研究需关注模型规模扩展和适应性改进。

Abstract: As language model agents are applied to real world problems of increasing
complexity, they will be expected to formulate plans across large search
spaces. If those plans fail for reasons beyond their control, how well do
language agents search for alternative ways to achieve their goals? We devise a
specialized agentic planning benchmark to study this question. Each planning
problem is solved via combinations of function calls. The agent searches for
relevant functions from a set of over four thousand possibilities, and observes
environmental feedback in the form of function outputs or error messages. Our
benchmark confronts the agent with external failures in its workflow, such as
functions that suddenly become unavailable. At the same time, even with the
introduction of these failures, we guarantee that the task remains solvable.
Ideally, an agent's performance on the planning task should not be affected by
the presence of external failures. Overall, we find that language agents
struggle to formulate and execute backup plans in response to environment
feedback. While state-of-the-art models are often able to identify the correct
function to use in the right context, they struggle to adapt to feedback from
the environment and often fail to pursue alternate courses of action, even when
the search space is artificially restricted. We provide a systematic analysis
of the failures of both open-source and commercial models, examining the
effects of search space size, as well as the benefits of scaling model size in
our setting. Our analysis identifies key challenges for current generative
models as well as promising directions for future work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管在偏见检测和缓解方面取得了进展，但某些挑战仍未充分探索，尤其是在敏感话题上的偏见。

Method: 结合极化敏感的情感指标和合成的平衡数据集，使用预定义的语义类别进行评估。

Result: 在俄罗斯-乌克兰战争的案例中，发现LLM普遍对乌克兰持更积极态度，但不同语义类别间存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 该框架支持自动化数据集生成和细粒度偏见评估，适用于多种极化驱动的场景和主题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to exhibit biases in downstream tasks,
especially when dealing with sensitive topics such as political discourse,
gender identity, ethnic relations, or national stereotypes. Although
significant progress has been made in bias detection and mitigation techniques,
certain challenges remain underexplored. This study proposes a reusable,
granular, and topic-agnostic framework to evaluate polarisation-related biases
in LLM (both open-source and closed-source). Our approach combines
polarisation-sensitive sentiment metrics with a synthetically generated
balanced dataset of conflict-related statements, using a predefined set of
semantic categories.
  As a case study, we created a synthetic dataset that focusses on the
Russia-Ukraine war, and we evaluated the bias in several LLMs: Llama-3,
Mistral, GPT-4, Claude 3.5, and Gemini 1.0. Beyond aggregate bias scores, with
a general trend for more positive sentiment toward Ukraine, the framework
allowed fine-grained analysis with considerable variation between semantic
categories, uncovering divergent behavioural patterns among models. Adaptation
to prompt modifications showed further bias towards preconceived language and
citizenship modification.
  Overall, the framework supports automated dataset generation and fine-grained
bias assessment, is applicable to a variety of polarisation-driven scenarios
and topics, and is orthogonal to many other bias-evaluation strategies.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) enabled the development of AI
agents that can plan and interact with tools to complete complex tasks.
However, literature on their reliability in real-world applications remains
limited. In this paper, we introduce a multi-agent framework for a marketing
task: audience curation. To solve this, we introduce a framework called RAMP
that iteratively plans, calls tools, verifies the output, and generates
suggestions to improve the quality of the audience generated. Additionally, we
equip the model with a long-term memory store, which is a knowledge base of
client-specific facts and past queries. Overall, we demonstrate the use of LLM
planning and memory, which increases accuracy by 28 percentage points on a set
of 88 evaluation queries. Moreover, we show the impact of iterative
verification and reflection on more ambiguous queries, showing progressively
better recall (roughly +20 percentage points) with more verify/reflect
iterations on a smaller challenge set, and higher user satisfaction. Our
results provide practical insights for deploying reliable LLM-based systems in

Method: 通过分解标注流程，大规模收集并手动回答自然且耗时的问题，构建MoNaCo基准测试。

Result: 前沿LLMs在MoNaCo上的F1得分最高仅为61.2%，主要受低召回率和幻觉问题影响。

Conclusion: MoNaCo为评估和改进LLMs在复杂信息检索任务中的表现提供了有效资源。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a go-to tool for querying
information. However, current LLM benchmarks rarely feature natural questions
that are both information-seeking as well as genuinely time-consuming for
humans. To address this gap we introduce MoNaCo, a benchmark of 1,315 natural
and complex questions that require dozens, and at times hundreds, of
intermediate steps to solve -- far more than any existing QA benchmark. To
build MoNaCo, we developed a decomposed annotation pipeline to elicit and
manually answer natural time-consuming questions at scale. Frontier LLMs
evaluated on MoNaCo achieve at most 61.2% F1, hampered by low recall and
hallucinations. Our results underscore the need for reasoning models that
better handle the complexity and sheer breadth of real-world
information-seeking questions -- with MoNaCo providing an effective resource
for tracking such progress. The MONACO benchmark, codebase, prompts and models

Abstract: This paper presents MobQA, a benchmark dataset designed to evaluate the
semantic understanding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for human
mobility data through natural language question answering.
  While existing models excel at predicting human movement patterns, it remains
unobvious how much they can interpret the underlying reasons or semantic
meaning of those patterns. MobQA provides a comprehensive evaluation framework
for LLMs to answer questions about diverse human GPS trajectories spanning
daily to weekly granularities. It comprises 5,800 high-quality question-answer
pairs across three complementary question types: factual retrieval (precise
data extraction), multiple-choice reasoning (semantic inference), and free-form
explanation (interpretive description), which all require spatial, temporal,
and semantic reasoning. Our evaluation of major LLMs reveals strong performance
on factual retrieval but significant limitations in semantic reasoning and
explanation question answering, with trajectory length substantially impacting
model effectiveness. These findings demonstrate the achievements and
limitations of state-of-the-art LLMs for semantic mobility
understanding.\footnote{MobQA dataset is available at

Abstract: Tulu, a low-resource Dravidian language predominantly spoken in southern
India, has limited computational resources despite its growing digital
presence. This study presents the first benchmark dataset for Offensive

collected from YouTube comments across various domains. The dataset, annotated
with high inter-annotator agreement (Krippendorff's alpha = 0.984), includes
3,845 comments categorized into four classes: Not Offensive, Not Tulu,
Offensive Untargeted, and Offensive Targeted. We evaluate a suite of deep
learning models, including GRU, LSTM, BiGRU, BiLSTM, CNN, and attention-based
variants, alongside transformer architectures (mBERT, XLM-RoBERTa). The BiGRU
model with self-attention achieves the best performance with 82% accuracy and a
0.81 macro F1-score. Transformer models underperform, highlighting the
limitations of multilingual pretraining in code-mixed, under-resourced

Result: 实验表明该方法在140名学生中表现最佳，并能推广到群体层面。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效生成个性化干扰项，具有鲁棒性和适应性。

Abstract: Distractors, incorrect but plausible answer choices in multiple-choice
questions (MCQs), play a critical role in educational assessment by diagnosing
student misconceptions. Recent work has leveraged large language models (LLMs)
to generate shared, group-level distractors by learning common error patterns
across large student populations. However, such distractors often fail to
capture the diverse reasoning errors of individual students, limiting their
diagnostic effectiveness. To address this limitation, we introduce the task of
personalized distractor generation, which aims to generate tailored distractors
based on individual misconceptions inferred from each student's past
question-answering (QA) records, ensuring every student receives options that
effectively exposes their specific reasoning errors. While promising, this task
is challenging because each student typically has only a few QA records, which
often lack the student's underlying reasoning processes, making training-based
group-level approaches infeasible. To overcome this, we propose a training-free
two-stage framework. In the first stage, we construct a student-specific
misconception prototype by applying Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to recover
the student's reasoning trajectories from past incorrect answers. In the second
stage, this prototype guides the simulation of the student's reasoning on new
questions, enabling the generation of personalized distractors that align with
the student's recurring misconceptions. Experiments show that our approach
achieves the best performance in generating plausible, personalized distractors
for 140 students, and also effectively generalizes to group-level settings,
highlighting its robustness and adaptability.

Abstract: Recent advancements in speech-to-text translation have led to the development
of multilingual models capable of handling multiple language pairs
simultaneously. However, these unified models often suffer from large parameter
sizes, making it challenging to balance inference efficiency and performance,
particularly in local deployment scenarios. We propose an innovative Parasitic
Dual-Scale Approach, which combines an enhanced speculative sampling method
with model compression and knowledge distillation techniques. Building on the
Whisper Medium model, we enhance it for multilingual speech translation into
whisperM2M, and integrate our novel KVSPN module, achieving state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance across six popular languages with improved inference
efficiency. KVSPN enables a 40\% speedup with no BLEU score degradation.
Combined with distillation methods, it represents a 2.6$\times$ speedup over
the original Whisper Medium with superior performance.

Motivation: 社交媒体上多模态虚假信息的检测面临模态不一致、时序变化和类别不平衡等挑战，现有方法未能有效捕捉事件级结构。

Method: E-CaTCH通过聚类生成伪事件，提取文本和视觉特征，利用自注意力和跨模态注意力对齐，结合时序LSTM建模事件演化，并通过自适应加权和正则化解决类别不平衡。

Conclusion: E-CaTCH通过事件级建模和多模态融合，为虚假信息检测提供了高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Detecting multimodal misinformation on social media remains challenging due
to inconsistencies between modalities, changes in temporal patterns, and
substantial class imbalance. Many existing methods treat posts independently
and fail to capture the event-level structure that connects them across time
and modality. We propose E-CaTCH, an interpretable and scalable framework for
robustly detecting misinformation. If needed, E-CaTCH clusters posts into
pseudo-events based on textual similarity and temporal proximity, then
processes each event independently. Within each event, textual and visual
features are extracted using pre-trained BERT and ResNet encoders, refined via
intra-modal self-attention, and aligned through bidirectional cross-modal
attention. A soft gating mechanism fuses these representations to form
contextualized, content-aware embeddings of each post. To model temporal
evolution, E-CaTCH segments events into overlapping time windows and uses a
trend-aware LSTM, enhanced with semantic shift and momentum signals, to encode
narrative progression over time. Classification is performed at the event
level, enabling better alignment with real-world misinformation dynamics. To
address class imbalance and promote stable learning, the model integrates
adaptive class weighting, temporal consistency regularization, and hard-example
mining. The total loss is aggregated across all events. Extensive experiments
on Fakeddit, IND, and COVID-19 MISINFOGRAPH demonstrate that E-CaTCH
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Cross-dataset evaluations
further demonstrate its robustness, generalizability, and practical
applicability across diverse misinformation scenarios.

Conclusion: HGRAG通过跨粒度整合结构和语义信息，显著提升了多跳问答的效果和效率。

Abstract: Multi-hop question answering (MHQA) requires integrating knowledge scattered
across multiple passages to derive the correct answer. Traditional
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods primarily focus on coarse-grained
textual semantic similarity and ignore structural associations among dispersed
knowledge, which limits their effectiveness in MHQA tasks. GraphRAG methods
address this by leveraging knowledge graphs (KGs) to capture structural
associations, but they tend to overly rely on structural information and
fine-grained word- or phrase-level retrieval, resulting in an underutilization
of textual semantics. In this paper, we propose a novel RAG approach called
HGRAG for MHQA that achieves cross-granularity integration of structural and
semantic information via hypergraphs. Structurally, we construct an entity
hypergraph where fine-grained entities serve as nodes and coarse-grained
passages as hyperedges, and establish knowledge association through shared
entities. Semantically, we design a hypergraph retrieval method that integrates
fine-grained entity similarity and coarse-grained passage similarity via
hypergraph diffusion. Finally, we employ a retrieval enhancement module, which
further refines the retrieved results both semantically and structurally, to
obtain the most relevant passages as context for answer generation with the
LLM. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in QA performance, and achieves a
6$\times$ speedup in retrieval efficiency.

Motivation: 评估LLMs在低资源语言中的语言学推理能力，揭示其弱点。

Method: 分析629个问题，覆盖41种低资源语言，标注语言学特征。

Result: LLMs在形态复杂度高的谜题中表现差，但在与英语相似的特征上表现较好。词素分解能提升表现。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在语言学推理和低资源语言建模中的挑战，需改进分词器。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in reasoning tasks,
but their performance on linguistics puzzles remains consistently poor. These
puzzles, often derived from Linguistics Olympiad (LO) contests, provide a
minimal contamination environment to assess LLMs' linguistic reasoning
abilities across low-resource languages. This work analyses LLMs' performance
on 629 problems across 41 low-resource languages by labelling each with
linguistically informed features to unveil weaknesses. Our analyses show that
LLMs struggle with puzzles involving higher morphological complexity and
perform better on puzzles involving linguistic features that are also found in
English. We also show that splitting words into morphemes as a pre-processing
step improves solvability, indicating a need for more informed and
language-specific tokenisers. These findings thus offer insights into some
challenges in linguistic reasoning and modelling of low-resource languages.

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) in specific domain like tourism
remains challenging due to the prohibitive cost of annotated benchmarks and
persistent issues like hallucinations. We propose $\textbf{L}$able-Free
$\textbf{E}$valuation of LLM on $\textbf{T}$ourism using Expert
$\textbf{T}$ree-$\textbf{o}$f-$\textbf{T}$hought (LETToT), a framework that
leverages expert-derived reasoning structures-instead of labeled data-to access
LLMs in tourism. First, we iteratively refine and validate hierarchical ToT
components through alignment with generic quality dimensions and expert
feedback. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of our systematically optimized
expert ToT with 4.99-14.15\% relative quality gains over baselines. Second, we
apply LETToT's optimized expert ToT to evaluate models of varying scales
(32B-671B parameters), revealing: (1) Scaling laws persist in specialized
domains (DeepSeek-V3 leads), yet reasoning-enhanced smaller models (e.g.,
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B) close this gap; (2) For sub-72B models, explicit
reasoning architectures outperform counterparts in accuracy and conciseness
($p<0.05$). Our work established a scalable, label-free paradigm for
domain-specific LLM evaluation, offering a robust alternative to conventional
annotated benchmarks.

Conclusion: 方法可扩展至其他语言和任务，小模型在毒性检测中具有潜力。

Abstract: Detecting toxic content using language models is crucial yet challenging.
While substantial progress has been made in English, toxicity detection in
French remains underdeveloped, primarily due to the lack of culturally
relevant, large-scale datasets. In this work, we introduce TOXIFRENCH, a new
public benchmark of 53,622 French online comments, constructed via a
semi-automated annotation pipeline that reduces manual labeling to only 10%
through high-confidence LLM-based pre-annotation and human verification. Then,
we benchmark a broad range of models and uncover a counterintuitive insight:
Small Language Models (SLMs) outperform many larger models in robustness and
generalization under the toxicity detection task. Motivated by this finding, we
propose a novel Chain-of-Thought (CoT) fine-tuning strategy using a dynamic
weighted loss that progressively emphasizes the model's final decision,
significantly improving faithfulness. Our fine-tuned 4B model achieves
state-of-the-art performance, improving its F1 score by 13% over its baseline
and outperforming LLMs such as GPT-40 and Gemini-2.5. Further evaluation on a
cross-lingual toxicity benchmark demonstrates strong multilingual ability,
suggesting that our methodology can be effectively extended to other languages
and safety-critical classification tasks.

Motivation: 了解LLM在心理健康问题回答中的情感表达差异，以指导模型选择和应用。

Method: 对8种LLM生成的2,880个回答进行情感和情绪评分，分析模型、问题类型和用户画像的影响。

Result: 不同LLM的情感表达差异显著，Mixtral负面情绪最高，Llama最乐观；焦虑问题引发高恐惧，抑郁问题引发高悲伤，压力问题最乐观。

Conclusion: LLM的情感特征对用户体验至关重要，模型选择应根据具体心理健康需求。

Abstract: Depression, anxiety, and stress are widespread mental health concerns that
increasingly drive individuals to seek information from Large Language Models
(LLMs). This study investigates how eight LLMs (Claude Sonnet, Copilot, Gemini
Pro, GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini, Llama, Mixtral, and Perplexity) reply to twenty
pragmatic questions about depression, anxiety, and stress when those questions
are framed for six user profiles (baseline, woman, man, young, old, and
university student). The models generated 2,880 answers, which we scored for
sentiment and emotions using state-of-the-art tools. Our analysis revealed that
optimism, fear, and sadness dominated the emotional landscape across all
outputs, with neutral sentiment maintaining consistently high values.
Gratitude, joy, and trust appeared at moderate levels, while emotions such as
anger, disgust, and love were rarely expressed. The choice of LLM significantly
influenced emotional expression patterns. Mixtral exhibited the highest levels
of negative emotions including disapproval, annoyance, and sadness, while Llama
demonstrated the most optimistic and joyful responses. The type of mental
health condition dramatically shaped emotional responses: anxiety prompts
elicited extraordinarily high fear scores (0.974), depression prompts generated
elevated sadness (0.686) and the highest negative sentiment, while
stress-related queries produced the most optimistic responses (0.755) with
elevated joy and trust. In contrast, demographic framing of queries produced
only marginal variations in emotional tone. Statistical analyses confirmed
significant model-specific and condition-specific differences, while
demographic influences remained minimal. These findings highlight the critical
importance of model selection in mental health applications, as each LLM
exhibits a distinct emotional signature that could significantly impact user
experience and outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs的安全机制导致模型拒绝表面上类似有害内容的良性指令，降低了生产应用中的实用性。

Method: 通过分析LLMs在嵌入空间中的轨迹模式，提出SafeConstellations方法，在推理时选择性引导模型行为。

Result: 该方法将过度拒绝率降低高达73%，且对实用性影响最小。

Conclusion: SafeConstellations提供了一种减少过度拒绝行为的有效方法，同时保持了模型的通用性。

Abstract: LLMs increasingly exhibit over-refusal behavior, where safety mechanisms
cause models to reject benign instructions that superficially resemble harmful
content. This phenomena diminishes utility in production applications that
repeatedly rely on common prompt templates or applications that frequently rely
on LLMs for specific tasks (e.g. sentiment analysis, language translation).
Through comprehensive evaluation, we demonstrate that LLMs still tend to refuse
responses to harmful instructions when those instructions are reframed to
appear as benign tasks. Our mechanistic analysis reveal that LLMs follow
distinct "constellation" patterns in embedding space as representations
traverse layers, with each task maintaining consistent trajectories that shift
predictably between refusal and non-refusal cases. We introduce
SafeConstellations, an inference-time trajectory-shifting approach that tracks
task-specific trajectory patterns and guides representations toward non-refusal
pathways. By selectively guiding model behavior only on tasks prone to
over-refusal, and by preserving general model behavior, our method reduces
over-refusal rates by up to 73% with minimal impact on utility-offering a
principled approach to mitigating over-refusals.

Conclusion: SGSimEval提供了一个更全面的评估框架，解决了现有方法的局限性，并验证了其有效性。

Abstract: The growing interest in automatic survey generation (ASG), a task that
traditionally required considerable time and effort, has been spurred by recent
advances in large language models (LLMs). With advancements in
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and the rising popularity of multi-agent
systems (MASs), synthesizing academic surveys using LLMs has become a viable
approach, thereby elevating the need for robust evaluation methods in this
domain. However, existing evaluation methods suffer from several limitations,
including biased metrics, a lack of human preference, and an over-reliance on
LLMs-as-judges. To address these challenges, we propose SGSimEval, a
comprehensive benchmark for Survey Generation with Similarity-Enhanced
Evaluation that evaluates automatic survey generation systems by integrating
assessments of the outline, content, and references, and also combines
LLM-based scoring with quantitative metrics to provide a multifaceted
evaluation framework. In SGSimEval, we also introduce human preference metrics
that emphasize both inherent quality and similarity to humans. Extensive
experiments reveal that current ASG systems demonstrate human-comparable
superiority in outline generation, while showing significant room for
improvement in content and reference generation, and our evaluation metrics
maintain strong consistency with human assessments.

across various tasks. The study measures the trade-offs between model
compression and task performance, analyzing key evaluation metrics, namely
accuracy, inference latency, and throughput (total output tokens generated per
second), providing insights into the suitability of low-bit quantization for
real-world deployment. Using the results, users can then make suitable
decisions based on the specifications that need to be met. We discuss the pros
and cons of GSQ and GPTQ techniques on models of different sizes, which also
serve as a benchmark for future experiments.

Conclusion: 信号处理技术为LLM生成文本检测提供了高效且可解释的新途径。

Abstract: The proliferation of high-quality text from Large Language Models (LLMs)
demands reliable and efficient detection methods. While existing training-free
approaches show promise, they often rely on surface-level statistics and
overlook fundamental signal properties of the text generation process. In this
work, we reframe detection as a signal processing problem, introducing a novel
paradigm that analyzes the sequence of token log-probabilities in the frequency
domain. By systematically analyzing the signal's spectral properties using the
global Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and the local Short-Time Fourier
Transform (STFT), we find that human-written text consistently exhibits
significantly higher spectral energy. This higher energy reflects the
larger-amplitude fluctuations inherent in human writing compared to the
suppressed dynamics of LLM-generated text. Based on this key insight, we
construct SpecDetect, a detector built on a single, robust feature from the
global DFT: DFT total energy. We also propose an enhanced version,
SpecDetect++, which incorporates a sampling discrepancy mechanism to further
boost robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
outperforms the state-of-the-art model while running in nearly half the time.
Our work introduces a new, efficient, and interpretable pathway for
LLM-generated text detection, showing that classical signal processing
techniques offer a surprisingly powerful solution to this modern challenge.

Abstract: Automated feedback generation has the potential to enhance students' learning
progress by providing timely and targeted feedback. Moreover, it can assist
teachers in optimizing their time, allowing them to focus on more strategic and
personalized aspects of teaching. To generate high-quality, information-rich
formative feedback, it is essential first to extract relevant indicators, as
these serve as the foundation upon which the feedback is constructed. Teachers
often employ feedback criteria grids composed of various indicators that they
evaluate systematically. This study examines the initial phase of extracting
such indicators from students' submissions of a language learning course using
the large language model Llama 3.1. Accordingly, the alignment between
indicators generated by the LLM and human ratings across various feedback
criteria is investigated. The findings demonstrate statistically significant
strong correlations, even in cases involving unanticipated combinations of
indicators and criteria. The methodology employed in this paper offers a
promising foundation for extracting indicators from students' submissions using
LLMs. Such indicators can potentially be utilized to auto-generate explainable
and transparent formative feedback in future research.

Abstract: This technical report details a novel approach to combining reasoning and
retrieval augmented generation (RAG) within a single, lean language model
architecture. While existing RAG systems typically rely on large-scale models
and external APIs, our work addresses the increasing demand for performant and
privacy-preserving solutions deployable in resource-constrained or secure
environments. Building on recent developments in test-time scaling and
small-scale reasoning models, we develop a retrieval augmented conversational
agent capable of interpreting complex, domain-specific queries using a
lightweight backbone model. Our system integrates a dense retriever with
fine-tuned Qwen2.5-Instruct models, using synthetic query generation and
reasoning traces derived from frontier models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) over a
curated corpus, in this case, the NHS A-to-Z condition pages. We explore the
impact of summarisation-based document compression, synthetic data design, and
reasoning-aware fine-tuning on model performance. Evaluation against both
non-reasoning and general-purpose lean models demonstrates that our
domain-specific fine-tuning approach yields substantial gains in answer
accuracy and consistency, approaching frontier-level performance while
remaining feasible for local deployment. All implementation details and code
are publicly released to support reproducibility and adaptation across domains.

Abstract: Concurrent to the rapid progress in the development of neural-network based
models in areas like natural language processing and computer vision, the need
for creating explanations for the predictions of these black-box models has
risen steadily. We propose a new method to generate extractive explanations for
predictions made by neural networks, that is based on masking parts of the
input which the model does not consider to be indicative of the respective
class. The masking is done using gradient-based optimization combined with a
new regularization scheme that enforces sufficiency, comprehensiveness and
compactness of the generated explanation, three properties that are known to be
desirable from the related field of rationale extraction in natural language
processing. In this way, we bridge the gap between model interpretability and
rationale extraction, thereby proving that the latter of which can be performed
without training a specialized model, only on the basis of a trained
classifier. We further apply the same method to image inputs and obtain high
quality explanations for image classifications, which indicates that the
conditions proposed for rationale extraction in natural language processing are
more broadly applicable to different input types.

Abstract: We propose an end-to-end differentiable training paradigm for stable training
of a rationalized transformer classifier. Our approach results in a single
model that simultaneously classifies a sample and scores input tokens based on
their relevance to the classification. To this end, we build on the widely-used
three-player-game for training rationalized models, which typically relies on
training a rationale selector, a classifier and a complement classifier. We
simplify this approach by making a single model fulfill all three roles,
leading to a more efficient training paradigm that is not susceptible to the
common training instabilities that plague existing approaches. Further, we
extend this paradigm to produce class-wise rationales while incorporating
recent advances in parameterizing and regularizing the resulting rationales,
thus leading to substantially improved and state-of-the-art alignment with
human annotations without any explicit supervision.

Conclusion: 简单的方法可以有效调整模型的价值观系统，实现行为对齐。

Abstract: Large language models implicitly encode preferences over human values, yet
steering them often requires large training data. In this work, we investigate
a simple approach: Can we reliably modify a model's value system in downstream
behavior by training it to answer value survey questions accordingly? We first
construct value profiles of several open-source LLMs by asking them to rate a
series of value-related descriptions spanning 20 distinct human values, which
we use as a baseline for subsequent experiments. We then investigate whether
the value system of a model can be governed by fine-tuning on the value
surveys. We evaluate the effect of finetuning on the model's behavior in two
ways; first, we assess how answers change on in-domain, held-out survey
questions. Second, we evaluate whether the model's behavior changes in
out-of-domain settings (situational scenarios). To this end, we construct a
contextualized moral judgment dataset based on Reddit posts and evaluate
changes in the model's behavior in text-based adventure games. We demonstrate
that our simple approach can not only change the model's answers to in-domain
survey questions, but also produces substantial shifts (value alignment) in
implicit downstream task behavior.

Motivation: 现有大型语言模型生成的幽默常显得通用、重复或不合时宜，因幽默高度依赖上下文和文化背景。

Method: 采用Plan-Search、Humor Chain-of-Thought模板、知识图谱、新颖性过滤和迭代修订循环。

Result: 实验显示，完整流程（知识图谱+修订）使Humor Generation Score均值提升15.4%。

Conclusion: HumorPlanSearch通过强调上下文，使AI生成的幽默更连贯、适应性强且文化敏感。

Abstract: Automated humor generation with Large Language Models (LLMs) often yields
jokes that feel generic, repetitive, or tone-deaf because humor is deeply
situated and hinges on the listener's cultural background, mindset, and
immediate context. We introduce HumorPlanSearch, a modular pipeline that
explicitly models context through: (1) Plan-Search for diverse, topic-tailored
strategies; (2) Humor Chain-of-Thought (HuCoT) templates capturing cultural and
stylistic reasoning; (3) a Knowledge Graph to retrieve and adapt
high-performing historical strategies; (4) novelty filtering via semantic
embeddings; and (5) an iterative judge-driven revision loop. To evaluate
context sensitivity and comedic quality, we propose the Humor Generation Score
(HGS), which fuses direct ratings, multi-persona feedback, pairwise win-rates,
and topic relevance. In experiments across nine topics with feedback from 13
human judges, our full pipeline (KG + Revision) boosts mean HGS by 15.4 percent
(p < 0.05) over a strong baseline. By foregrounding context at every stage from
strategy planning to multi-signal evaluation, HumorPlanSearch advances
AI-driven humor toward more coherent, adaptive, and culturally attuned comedy.

### [129] [Online Anti-sexist Speech: Identifying Resistance to Gender Bias in Political Discourse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11434)
*Aditi Dutta,Susan Banducci*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在分类性别歧视、反性别歧视和中立政治推文时的表现，发现模型常将反性别歧视言论误判为有害内容，尤其是在政治敏感事件中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化内容审核系统可能无法区分反性别歧视言论与性别歧视言论，这可能导致挑战性别歧视的声音被压制。

Method: 分析了五种LLMs对2022年英国女性议员相关高关注事件的推文分类表现。

Result: 模型常将反性别歧视言论误判为有害，尤其在政治敏感事件中。

Conclusion: 建议审核设计应超越二元分类，整合人工审核，并在训练数据中明确包含反言论，以保护数字政治空间中的抵抗言论。

Abstract: Anti-sexist speech, i.e., public expressions that challenge or resist
gendered abuse and sexism, plays a vital role in shaping democratic debate
online. Yet automated content moderation systems, increasingly powered by large
language models (LLMs), may struggle to distinguish such resistance from the
sexism it opposes. This study examines how five LLMs classify sexist,
anti-sexist, and neutral political tweets from the UK, focusing on
high-salience trigger events involving female Members of Parliament in the year
2022. Our analysis show that models frequently misclassify anti-sexist speech
as harmful, particularly during politically charged events where rhetorical
styles of harm and resistance converge. These errors risk silencing those who
challenge sexism, with disproportionate consequences for marginalised voices.
We argue that moderation design must move beyond binary harmful/not-harmful
schemas, integrate human-in-the-loop review during sensitive events, and
explicitly include counter-speech in training data. By linking feminist
scholarship, event-based analysis, and model evaluation, this work highlights
the sociotechnical challenges of safeguarding resistance speech in digital
political spaces.

*Bowen Zhang,Zixin Song,Chunquan Chen,Qian-Wen Zhang,Di Yin,Xing Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoDiEmb框架通过任务专用目标、动态采样器和模型融合策略，有效解决了信息检索（IR）和语义文本相似性（STS）任务联合训练中的负迁移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联合训练IR和STS任务时，负迁移问题导致性能下降，需要一种系统化解耦任务信号的方法。

Method: CoDiEmb框架包含任务专用目标、动态采样器、delta引导的模型融合策略和高效单阶段训练流程。

Result: 在15个标准IR和STS基准测试中验证了CoDiEmb的有效性，显著减轻了跨任务性能折衷。

Conclusion: CoDiEmb不仅解决了任务冲突，还提升了嵌入空间的几何特性。

Abstract: Learning unified text embeddings that excel across diverse downstream tasks
is a central goal in representation learning, yet negative transfer remains a
persistent obstacle. This challenge is particularly pronounced when jointly
training a single encoder for Information Retrieval (IR) and Semantic Textual
Similarity (STS), two essential but fundamentally disparate tasks for which
naive co-training typically yields steep performance trade-offs. We argue that
resolving this conflict requires systematically decoupling task-specific
learning signals throughout the training pipeline. To this end, we introduce
CoDiEmb, a unified framework that reconciles the divergent requirements of IR
and STS in a collaborative yet distinct manner. CoDiEmb integrates three key
innovations for effective joint optimization: (1) Task-specialized objectives
paired with a dynamic sampler that forms single-task batches and balances
per-task updates, thereby preventing gradient interference. For IR, we employ a
contrastive loss with multiple positives and hard negatives, augmented by
cross-device sampling. For STS, we adopt order-aware objectives that directly
optimize correlation and ranking consistency. (2) A delta-guided model fusion
strategy that computes fine-grained merging weights for checkpoints by
analyzing each parameter's deviation from its pre-trained initialization,
proving more effective than traditional Model Soups. (3) An efficient,
single-stage training pipeline that is simple to implement and converges
stably. Extensive experiments on 15 standard IR and STS benchmarks across three
base encoders validate CoDiEmb. Our results and analysis demonstrate that the
framework not only mitigates cross-task trade-offs but also measurably improves
the geometric properties of the embedding space.

TL;DR: 论文研究了如何通过结构化提示（JSON格式）提升小型语言模型在情感分析中的表现，优于传统自然语言提示，适用于资源受限的设备。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有情感分析多基于文本内容，但营销理论指出客户评价还受其他参考点影响。研究探讨补充信息的内容和格式对LLM情感分析的影响。

Method: 比较自然语言和JSON格式提示，使用轻量级3B参数模型，实验基于Yelp的餐厅和夜生活类别数据。

Result: JSON提示表现最佳，Macro-F1提升1.6%和4%，RMSE降低16%和9.1%，且性能提升源于真实上下文推理。

Conclusion: 结构化提示使小型模型达到竞争性能，为大规模模型部署提供实用替代方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now widely used across many fields,
including marketing research. Sentiment analysis, in particular, helps firms
understand consumer preferences. While most NLP studies classify sentiment from
review text alone, marketing theories, such as prospect theory and
expectation--disconfirmation theory, point out that customer evaluations are
shaped not only by the actual experience but also by additional reference
points. This study therefore investigates how the content and format of such
supplementary information affect sentiment analysis using LLMs. We compare
natural language (NL) and JSON-formatted prompts using a lightweight 3B
parameter model suitable for practical marketing applications. Experiments on
two Yelp categories (Restaurant and Nightlife) show that the JSON prompt with
additional information outperforms all baselines without fine-tuning: Macro-F1
rises by 1.6% and 4% while RMSE falls by 16% and 9.1%, respectively, making it
deployable in resource-constrained edge devices. Furthermore, a follow-up
analysis confirms that performance gains stem from genuine contextual reasoning
rather than label proxying. This work demonstrates that structured prompting
can enable smaller models to achieve competitive performance, offering a
practical alternative to large-scale model deployment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）是否存在物种主义偏见及其对非人类动物的价值判断，发现LLMs能识别物种主义言论但很少谴责，且在权衡中更倾向于人类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs的广泛应用，研究其伦理倾向至关重要，尤其是公平性和歧视问题，特别是针对非人类动物的物种主义偏见。

Method: 通过三个范式研究：1) 物种主义基准测试；2) 心理学测量比较模型与人类反应；3) 文本生成任务分析模型对物种主义辩护的态度。

Result: LLMs能识别物种主义言论但很少谴责，在权衡中更倾向于人类，但在认知能力相同时无物种偏好。文本生成任务中常合理化对农场动物的伤害。

Conclusion: LLMs反映了人类主流观点，但需扩展AI公平性框架以明确包含非人类道德主体，减少物种主义偏见。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more widely deployed, it is crucial to
examine their ethical tendencies. Building on research on fairness and
discrimination in AI, we investigate whether LLMs exhibit speciesist bias --
discrimination based on species membership -- and how they value non-human
animals. We systematically examine this issue across three paradigms: (1)
SpeciesismBench, a 1,003-item benchmark assessing recognition and moral
evaluation of speciesist statements; (2) established psychological measures
comparing model responses with those of human participants; (3) text-generation
tasks probing elaboration on, or resistance to, speciesist rationalizations. In
our benchmark, LLMs reliably detected speciesist statements but rarely
condemned them, often treating speciesist attitudes as morally acceptable. On
psychological measures, results were mixed: LLMs expressed slightly lower
explicit speciesism than people, yet in direct trade-offs they more often chose
to save one human over multiple animals. A tentative interpretation is that
LLMs may weight cognitive capacity rather than species per se: when capacities
were equal, they showed no species preference, and when an animal was described
as more capable, they tended to prioritize it over a less capable human. In
open-ended text generation tasks, LLMs frequently normalized or rationalized
harm toward farmed animals while refusing to do so for non-farmed animals.
These findings suggest that while LLMs reflect a mixture of progressive and
mainstream human views, they nonetheless reproduce entrenched cultural norms
around animal exploitation. We argue that expanding AI fairness and alignment
frameworks to explicitly include non-human moral patients is essential for
reducing these biases and preventing the entrenchment of speciesist attitudes
in AI systems and the societies they influence.

TL;DR: 论文研究了语言模型（LMs）与大脑对齐的关系，发现语言模型可能内部表征跨模态的概念意义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 认知科学和神经科学长期面临区分语言表征与概念意义表征的挑战，语言模型中也存在类似问题。

Method: 通过分析大脑激活水平和跨模态意义一致性，使用fMRI数据集评估语言模型与大脑对齐。

Result: 实验表明，语言模型在意义一致性更高的脑区预测信号更好，即使这些区域对语言处理不敏感。

Conclusion: 语言模型可能内部表征跨模态的概念意义。

Abstract: Cognitive science and neuroscience have long faced the challenge of
disentangling representations of language from representations of conceptual
meaning. As the same problem arises in today's language models (LMs), we
investigate the relationship between LM--brain alignment and two neural
metrics: (1) the level of brain activation during processing of sentences,
targeting linguistic processing, and (2) a novel measure of meaning consistency
across input modalities, which quantifies how consistently a brain region
responds to the same concept across paradigms (sentence, word cloud, image)
using an fMRI dataset (Pereira et al., 2018). Our experiments show that both
language-only and language-vision models predict the signal better in more
meaning-consistent areas of the brain, even when these areas are not strongly
sensitive to language processing, suggesting that LMs might internally
represent cross-modal conceptual meaning.

TL;DR: 提出一种多智能体框架，通过模拟医患对话进行心理健康评估，结合自适应提问机制和树状记忆结构，提升信息提取和上下文跟踪能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统心理健康评估依赖专业医生，资源有限；现有AI方法多基于静态文本分析，难以捕捉动态交互中的深层信息。

Method: 采用多智能体框架，模拟医患对话，包括提问、评估、评分和更新智能体；引入自适应提问机制和树状记忆结构。

Result: 在DAIC-WOZ数据集上验证，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的框架能有效提升心理健康评估的动态交互能力和信息提取效率。

Abstract: Mental health assessment is crucial for early intervention and effective
treatment, yet traditional clinician-based approaches are limited by the
shortage of qualified professionals. Recent advances in artificial intelligence
have sparked growing interest in automated psychological assessment, yet most
existing approaches are constrained by their reliance on static text analysis,
limiting their ability to capture deeper and more informative insights that
emerge through dynamic interaction and iterative questioning. Therefore, in
this paper, we propose a multi-agent framework for mental health evaluation
that simulates clinical doctor-patient dialogues, with specialized agents
assigned to questioning, adequacy evaluation, scoring, and updating. We
introduce an adaptive questioning mechanism in which an evaluation agent
assesses the adequacy of user responses to determine the necessity of
generating targeted follow-up queries to address ambiguity and missing
information. Additionally, we employ a tree-structured memory in which the root
node encodes the user's basic information, while child nodes (e.g., topic and
statement) organize key information according to distinct symptom categories
and interaction turns. This memory is dynamically updated throughout the
interaction to reduce redundant questioning and further enhance the information
extraction and contextual tracking capabilities. Experimental results on the
DAIC-WOZ dataset illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, which
achieves better performance than existing approaches.

TL;DR: DR. SAF框架通过动态调整推理深度，显著提升了大型语言模型的计算效率，减少了冗余，同时保持了准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的长链思维推理方法存在冗余问题，且依赖人工定义的难度先验，与模型自感知难度不匹配，导致效率低下。

Method: 提出DR. SAF框架，包含边界自感知对齐、自适应奖励管理和边界保护机制，动态调整推理深度。

Result: 实验显示，DR. SAF减少了49.27%的响应token，提升了6.59倍的token效率，训练时间减少5倍，并在极端训练中超越传统模型。

Conclusion: DR. SAF在资源受限环境下高效平衡了推理效率和准确性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have greatly improved
their capabilities on complex reasoning tasks through Long Chain-of-Thought
(CoT). However, this approach often results in substantial redundancy,
impairing computational efficiency and causing significant delays in real-time
applications. To improve the efficiency, current methods often rely on
human-defined difficulty priors, which do not align with the LLM's self-awared
difficulty, leading to inefficiencies. In this paper, we introduce the Dynamic
Reasoning-Boundary Self-Awareness Framework (DR. SAF), which enables models to
dynamically assess and adjust their reasoning depth in response to problem
complexity. DR. SAF integrates three key components: Boundary Self-Awareness
Alignment, Adaptive Reward Management, and a Boundary Preservation Mechanism.
These components allow models to optimize their reasoning processes, balancing
efficiency and accuracy without compromising performance. Our experimental
results demonstrate that DR. SAF achieves a 49.27% reduction in total response
tokens with minimal loss in accuracy. The framework also delivers a 6.59x gain
in token efficiency and a 5x reduction in training time, making it well-suited
to resource-limited settings. During extreme training, DR. SAF can even surpass
traditional instruction-based models in token efficiency with more than 16%
accuracy improvement.

Motivation: 开发更接近人类听觉处理的语音表示学习模型，以高效处理多种语音任务。

Method: 第一阶段将原始音频转换为基于人类耳蜗的时频表示，提取离散的耳蜗标记；第二阶段对耳蜗标记应用自回归序列模型。

Result: AuriStream在SUPERB语音任务中表现优异，能生成音频延续并可视化。

Conclusion: AuriStream的两阶段框架为语音表示学习提供了新思路，推动了更类人模型的发展。

Abstract: We introduce AuriStream, a biologically inspired model for encoding speech
via a two-stage framework inspired by the human auditory processing hierarchy.
The first stage transforms raw audio into a time-frequency representation based
on the human cochlea, from which we extract discrete \textbf{cochlear tokens}.
The second stage applies an autoregressive sequence model over the cochlear
tokens. AuriStream learns meaningful phoneme and word representations, and
state-of-the-art lexical semantics. AuriStream shows competitive performance on
diverse downstream SUPERB speech tasks. Complementing AuriStream's strong
representational capabilities, it generates continuations of audio which can be
visualized in a spectrogram space and decoded back into audio, providing
insights into the model's predictions. In summary, we present a two-stage
framework for speech representation learning to advance the development of more
human-like models that efficiently handle a range of speech-based tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉蕴含数据集规模小且稀疏，人工创建成本高，因此需要合成数据解决方案。

Method: 利用SNLI文本前提作为生成模型Stable Diffusion的输入提示，生成图像替代文本前提，并通过CLIP特征向量训练视觉蕴含分类器进行内外评估。

Result: 合成数据在SNLI-VE和SICK-VTE数据集上仅导致F-score轻微下降（0.686 vs 0.703；0.384 vs 0.400）。

Conclusion: 合成数据在数据稀疏情况下是训练视觉蕴含模型的有效替代方案。

Abstract: In this paper we present and validate a new synthetic dataset for training
visual entailment models. Existing datasets for visual entailment are small and
sparse compared to datasets for textual entailment. Manually creating datasets
is labor-intensive. We base our synthetic dataset on the SNLI dataset for
textual entailment. We take the premise text from SNLI as input prompts in a
generative image model, Stable Diffusion, creating an image to replace each
textual premise. We evaluate our dataset both intrinsically and extrinsically.
For extrinsic evaluation, we evaluate the validity of the generated images by
using them as training data for a visual entailment classifier based on CLIP
feature vectors. We find that synthetic training data only leads to a slight
drop in quality on SNLI-VE, with an F-score 0.686 compared to 0.703 when
trained on real data. We also compare the quality of our generated training
data to original training data on another dataset: SICK-VTE. Again, there is
only a slight drop in F-score: from 0.400 to 0.384. These results indicate that
in settings with data sparsity, synthetic data can be a promising solution for
training visual entailment models.

Result: 在内容无关和内容感知的布局生成任务中，生成了更高质量的布局，适用于下游图形设计任务。

Conclusion: LayoutRectifier无需额外训练，可有效补充基于学习的布局生成方法。

Abstract: Recent deep learning methods can generate diverse graphic design layouts
efficiently. However, these methods often create layouts with flaws, such as
misalignment, unwanted overlaps, and unsatisfied containment. To tackle this
issue, we propose an optimization-based method called LayoutRectifier, which
gracefully rectifies auto-generated graphic design layouts to reduce these
flaws while minimizing deviation from the generated layout. The core of our
method is a two-stage optimization. First, we utilize grid systems, which
professional designers commonly use to organize elements, to mitigate
misalignments through discrete search. Second, we introduce a novel box
containment function designed to adjust the positions and sizes of the layout
elements, preventing unwanted overlapping and promoting desired containment. We
evaluate our method on content-agnostic and content-aware layout generation
tasks and achieve better-quality layouts that are more suitable for downstream
graphic design tasks. Our method complements learning-based layout generation
methods and does not require additional training.

TL;DR: StyleMM是一个基于文本描述构建风格化3D可变形模型（3DMM）的新框架，通过扩散模型生成风格化目标图像，并保持面部属性一致性。


<details>

Motivation: 现有方法在3D风格化中难以保持面部属性（如身份、表情）的一致性，StyleMM旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 结合预训练的网格变形网络和纹理生成器，利用扩散模型生成的风格化图像进行微调，并引入显式保留面部属性的方法。

Result: StyleMM在身份多样性和风格化能力上优于现有方法，支持对形状、表情和纹理参数的显式控制。

Conclusion: StyleMM实现了高质量的3D风格化，同时保持面部属性的一致性，为3DMM提供了新的应用可能性。

Abstract: We introduce StyleMM, a novel framework that can construct a stylized 3D
Morphable Model (3DMM) based on user-defined text descriptions specifying a
target style. Building upon a pre-trained mesh deformation network and a
texture generator for original 3DMM-based realistic human faces, our approach
fine-tunes these models using stylized facial images generated via text-guided
image-to-image (i2i) translation with a diffusion model, which serve as
stylization targets for the rendered mesh. To prevent undesired changes in
identity, facial alignment, or expressions during i2i translation, we introduce
a stylization method that explicitly preserves the facial attributes of the
source image. By maintaining these critical attributes during image
stylization, the proposed approach ensures consistent 3D style transfer across
the 3DMM parameter space through image-based training. Once trained, StyleMM
enables feed-forward generation of stylized face meshes with explicit control
over shape, expression, and texture parameters, producing meshes with
consistent vertex connectivity and animatability. Quantitative and qualitative
evaluations demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods
in terms of identity-level facial diversity and stylization capability. The

Motivation: 尽管现有的文本到图像扩散模型在生成与文本提示对齐的图像方面表现优异，但控制输出图像的视觉风格仍具挑战性。

Method: SPG通过构建风格噪声向量，并利用其与无条件噪声的方向偏差来引导扩散过程朝向目标风格分布。

Result: 实验表明，SPG在风格一致性和语义保真方面优于现有方法，且兼容ControlNet和IPAdapter等可控框架。

Conclusion: SPG是一种简单、鲁棒且广泛适用的方法，为风格特定的图像生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Although recent text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models excel at aligning
generated images with textual prompts, controlling the visual style of the
output remains a challenging task. In this work, we propose Style-Prompting
Guidance (SPG), a novel sampling strategy for style-specific image generation.
SPG constructs a style noise vector and leverages its directional deviation
from unconditional noise to guide the diffusion process toward the target style
distribution. By integrating SPG with Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), our
method achieves both semantic fidelity and style consistency. SPG is simple,
robust, and compatible with controllable frameworks like ControlNet and
IPAdapter, making it practical and widely applicable. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our approach compared to
state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at

Result: 通过原型实现的实证评估，展示了该方法的可扩展性。

Conclusion: 提出的智能基础化方法有效解决了ASPIC+中一阶规则推理的规模和效率问题。

Abstract: ASPIC+ is one of the main general frameworks for rule-based argumentation for
AI. Although first-order rules are commonly used in ASPIC+ examples, most
existing approaches to reason over rule-based argumentation only support
propositional rules. To enable reasoning over first-order instances, a
preliminary grounding step is required. As groundings can lead to an
exponential increase in the size of the input theories, intelligent procedures
are needed. However, there is a lack of dedicated solutions for ASPIC+.
Therefore, we propose an intelligent grounding procedure that keeps the size of
the grounding manageable while preserving the correctness of the reasoning
process. To this end, we translate the first-order ASPIC+ instance into a
Datalog program and query a Datalog engine to obtain ground substitutions to
perform the grounding of rules and contraries. Additionally, we propose
simplifications specific to the ASPIC+ formalism to avoid grounding of rules
that have no influence on the reasoning process. Finally, we performed an
empirical evaluation of a prototypical implementation to show scalability.

(i.e., seeker) and single-model (i.e., provider) scenarios, real-world
applications often involve multiple interacting stakeholders. Optimizing
outcomes for seekers under an individual welfare approach overlooks the
inherently multi-agent nature of real-world systems, where individuals interact
and compete for limited resources. To address this, we introduce a novel
framework for multi-agent algorithmic recourse that accounts for multiple
recourse seekers and recourse providers. We model this many-to-many interaction
as a capacitated weighted bipartite matching problem, where matches are guided
by both recourse cost and provider capacity. Edge weights, reflecting recourse
costs, are optimized for social welfare while quantifying the welfare gap
between individual welfare and this collectively feasible outcome. We propose a
three-layer optimization framework: (1) basic capacitated matching, (2) optimal
capacity redistribution to minimize the welfare gap, and (3) cost-aware
optimization balancing welfare maximization with capacity adjustment costs.
Experimental validation on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrates that
our framework enables the many-to-many algorithmic recourse to achieve
near-optimal welfare with minimum modification in system settings. This work
extends algorithmic recourse from individual recommendations to system-level
design, providing a tractable path toward higher social welfare while
maintaining individual actionability.

Abstract: Proton PBS treatment planning for H&N cancers involves numerous conflicting
objectives, requiring significant effort from human planners to balance and
satisfy multiple clinical goals during planning. To achieve this,
experience-demanding objective parameter adjustment and computationally
expensive inverse optimization are performed iteratively. Extensive efforts
have been made to automatically adjust objective parameters, but the most
time-consuming component, i.e., inverse optimization, still relies heavily on
theory-driven approaches. We propose a data-driven inverse optimizer and
integrate it into a PPO-based automatic treatment planning framework to
automatically generate high-quality plans within a clinical acceptable planning
time. The inverse optimizer is a L2O method that predicts update steps by
learning from the task-specific data distribution. For the first time, we
integrate techniques designed for long-context processing, originally developed
for LLMs, into a Transformer-based L2O framework to address the scalability
issue of existing L2O methods. The PPO framework functions as an outer-loop
virtual planner, autonomously adjusting objective parameters through a policy
network, and the dose predictor is used to initialize objective parameters. The
inner-loop L2O inverse optimizer computes machine-deliverable MU values based
on objectives refined by the PPO policy network. 97 patients are collected in
this study, and compared with L-BFGSB, our L2O-based inverse optimizer improves
the effectiveness and efficiency by 22.97% and 36.41%, respectively. In
conjunction with the PPO-based learned virtual planner, plans generated by our
framework within an average of 2.55 hours show improved or comparable OAR
sparing with superior target coverage for patients with different prescription
dose levels, number of target volumes, beam angles, etc., compared with
human-generated plans.

Conclusion: 研究为ABA中的可接受性提供了新的视角，并指出了未来改进的方向。

Abstract: In this work, we broaden the investigation of admissibility notions in the
context of assumption-based argumentation (ABA). More specifically, we study
two prominent alternatives to the standard notion of admissibility from
abstract argumentation, namely strong and weak admissibility, and introduce the
respective preferred, complete and grounded semantics for general (sometimes
called non-flat) ABA. To do so, we use abstract bipolar set-based argumentation
frameworks (BSAFs) as formal playground since they concisely capture the
relations between assumptions and are expressive enough to represent general
non-flat ABA frameworks, as recently shown. While weak admissibility has been
recently investigated for a restricted fragment of ABA in which assumptions
cannot be derived (flat ABA), strong admissibility has not been investigated
for ABA so far. We introduce strong admissibility for ABA and investigate
desirable properties. We furthermore extend the recent investigations of weak
admissibility in the flat ABA fragment to the non-flat case. We show that the
central modularization property is maintained under classical, strong, and weak
admissibility. We also show that strong and weakly admissible semantics in
non-flat ABA share some of the shortcomings of standard admissible semantics
and discuss ways to address these.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准仅评估LRMs在明确问题上的表现，忽略了智能代理应具备主动请求信息的能力，以弥补问题信息不足的缺陷。

Method: 提出包含两类不完整问题的新数据集，并系统评估LRMs的表现，包括其主动请求信息的能力及相关行为（如过度思考和幻觉）。

Result: LRMs无法主动请求信息，且表现出过度思考和幻觉行为，监督微调在此能力学习中具有潜力但面临挑战。

Conclusion: 研究为开发真正智能的LRMs提供了新视角，强调其需超越单纯问题解决能力。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable problem-solving
abilities in mathematics, as evaluated by existing benchmarks exclusively on
well-defined problems. However, such evaluation setup constitutes a critical
gap, since a genuine intelligent agent should not only solve problems (as a
math quiz solver), but also be able~to ask for information when the problems
lack sufficient information, enabling proactivity in responding users'
requests. To bridge such gap, we proposes a new dataset consisting of two types
of incomplete problems with diverse contexts. Based on the dataset, our
systematical evaluation of LRMs reveals their inability in proactively asking
for information. In addition, we uncover the behaviors related to overthinking
and hallucination of LRMs, and highlight the potential and challenges of
supervised fine-tuning in learning such ability. We hope to provide new
insights in developing LRMs with genuine intelligence, rather than just solving
problems.

TL;DR: SAGE是一个针对动态知识图谱嵌入的尺度感知渐进演化框架，通过动态调整嵌入维度和动态蒸馏机制，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实中的知识图谱是动态演化的，现有方法未能充分考虑更新尺度的差异和系统评估。

Method: SAGE根据更新尺度确定嵌入维度并扩展嵌入空间，采用动态蒸馏机制平衡新旧知识。

Result: 在七个基准测试中，SAGE显著优于基线方法，MRR提升1.38%，H@1提升1.25%，H@10提升1.6%。

Conclusion: SAGE证明了自适应嵌入维度在动态知识图谱嵌入中的重要性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Traditional knowledge graph (KG) embedding methods aim to represent entities
and relations in a low-dimensional space, primarily focusing on static graphs.
However, real-world KGs are dynamically evolving with the constant addition of
entities, relations and facts. To address such dynamic nature of KGs, several
continual knowledge graph embedding (CKGE) methods have been developed to
efficiently update KG embeddings to accommodate new facts while maintaining
learned knowledge. As KGs grow at different rates and scales in real-world
scenarios, existing CKGE methods often fail to consider the varying scales of
updates and lack systematic evaluation throughout the entire update process. In
this paper, we propose SAGE, a scale-aware gradual evolution framework for
CKGE. Specifically, SAGE firstly determine the embedding dimensions based on
the update scales and expand the embedding space accordingly. The Dynamic
Distillation mechanism is further employed to balance the preservation of
learned knowledge and the incorporation of new facts. We conduct extensive
experiments on seven benchmarks, and the results show that SAGE consistently
outperforms existing baselines, with a notable improvement of 1.38% in MRR,
1.25% in H@1 and 1.6% in H@10. Furthermore, experiments comparing SAGE with
methods using fixed embedding dimensions show that SAGE achieves optimal
performance on every snapshot, demonstrating the importance of adaptive
embedding dimensions in CKGE. The codes of SAGE are publicly available at:

Conclusion: 结合课程学习和RL能有效提升GUI交互任务的性能。

Abstract: As autonomous agents become adept at understanding and interacting with
graphical user interface (GUI) environments, a new era of automated task
execution is emerging. Recent studies have demonstrated that Reinforcement
Learning (RL) can effectively enhance agents' performance in dynamic
interactive GUI environments. However, these methods face two key limitations:
(1) they overlook the significant variation in difficulty across different GUI
tasks by treating the entire training data as a uniform set, which hampers the
agent's ability to adapt its learning process; and (2) most approaches collapse
task-specific nuances into a single, coarse reward, leaving the agent with a
uniform signal that yields inefficient policy updates. To address these
limitations, we propose CRAFT-GUI, a curriculum learning framework based on
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that explicitly accounts for the
varying difficulty across trajectories. To enable more fine-grained policy
optimization, we design a reward function that combines simple rule-based
signals with model-judged evaluation, providing richer and more nuanced
feedback during training. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
achieves significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art approaches,
outperforming them by 5.6% on public benchmarks Android Control and 10.3% on
our internal online benchmarks, respectively. These findings empirically
validate the effectiveness of integrating reinforcement learning with
curriculum learning in GUI interaction tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in mathematical reasoning and the long-term planning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have precipitated the development
of agents, which are being increasingly leveraged in business operations
processes. Decision models to optimize inventory levels are one of the core
elements of operations management. However, the capabilities of the LLM agent
in making inventory decisions in uncertain contexts, as well as the
decision-making biases (e.g. framing effect, etc.) of the agent, remain largely
unexplored. This prompts concerns regarding the capacity of LLM agents to
effectively address real-world problems, as well as the potential implications
of biases that may be present. To address this gap, we introduce AIM-Bench, a
novel benchmark designed to assess the decision-making behaviour of LLM agents
in uncertain supply chain management scenarios through a diverse series of
inventory replenishment experiments. Our results reveal that different LLMs
typically exhibit varying degrees of decision bias that are similar to those
observed in human beings. In addition, we explored strategies to mitigate the
pull-to-centre effect and the bullwhip effect, namely cognitive reflection and
implementation of information sharing. These findings underscore the need for
careful consideration of the potential biases in deploying LLMs in Inventory
decision-making scenarios. We hope that these insights will pave the way for
mitigating human decision bias and developing human-centred decision support
systems for supply chains.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
have ushered in a new era of AI capabilities, demonstrating near-human-level
performance across diverse scenarios. While numerous benchmarks (e.g., MMLU)
and leaderboards (e.g., Chatbot Arena) have been proposed to help evolve the
development of LLMs and MLLMs, most rely on static datasets or crowdsourced
general-domain prompts, often falling short of reflecting performance in
real-world applications. To bridge this critical gap, we present Inclusion
Arena, a live leaderboard that ranks models based on human feedback collected
directly from AI-powered applications. Our platform integrates pairwise model
comparisons into natural user interactions, ensuring evaluations reflect
practical usage scenarios. For robust model ranking, we employ the
Bradley-Terry model augmented with two key innovations: (1) Placement Matches,
a cold-start mechanism to quickly estimate initial ratings for newly integrated
models, and (2) Proximity Sampling, an intelligent comparison strategy that
prioritizes battles between models of similar capabilities to maximize
information gain and enhance rating stability. Extensive empirical analyses and
simulations demonstrate that Inclusion Arena yields reliable and stable
rankings, exhibits higher data transitivity compared to general crowdsourced
datasets, and significantly mitigates the risk of malicious manipulation. By
fostering an open alliance between foundation models and real-world
applications, Inclusion Arena aims to accelerate the development of LLMs and
MLLMs truly optimized for practical, user-centric deployments. The platform is

Motivation: 地标在经典规划中已有重要应用，但在随机领域很少使用。本文旨在探索地标在随机规划中的潜力。

Method: 通过形式化概率性地标，并改进UCT算法，平衡地标达成与最终目标达成的关系。

Result: 在基准测试中，合理选择的地标显著提升了UCT算法的性能，但最佳平衡点因问题而异。

Conclusion: 地标可以为解决MDP问题的实时算法提供有效指导。

Abstract: Landmarks$\unicode{x2013}$conditions that must be satisfied at some point in
every solution plan$\unicode{x2013}$have contributed to major advancements in
classical planning, but they have seldom been used in stochastic domains. We
formalize probabilistic landmarks and adapt the UCT algorithm to leverage them
as subgoals to decompose MDPs; core to the adaptation is balancing between
greedy landmark achievement and final goal achievement. Our results in
benchmark domains show that well-chosen landmarks can significantly improve the
performance of UCT in online probabilistic planning, while the best balance of
greedy versus long-term goal achievement is problem-dependent. The results
suggest that landmarks can provide helpful guidance for anytime algorithms
solving MDPs.

Abstract: Addressing large-scale planning problems has become one of the central
challenges in the planning community, deriving from the state-space explosion
caused by growing objects and actions. Recently, researchers have explored the
effectiveness of leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate helpful
actions and states to prune the search space. However, prior works have largely
overlooked integrating LLMs with domain-specific knowledge to ensure valid
plans. In this paper, we propose a novel LLM-assisted planner integrated with
problem decomposition, which first decomposes large planning problems into
multiple simpler sub-tasks. Then we explore two novel paradigms to utilize
LLMs, i.e., LLM4Inspire and LLM4Predict, to assist problem decomposition, where
LLM4Inspire provides heuristic guidance according to general knowledge and
LLM4Predict employs domain-specific knowledge to infer intermediate conditions.
We empirically validate the effectiveness of our planner across multiple
domains, demonstrating the ability of search space partition when solving
large-scale planning problems. The experimental results show that LLMs
effectively locate feasible solutions when pruning the search space, where
infusing domain-specific knowledge into LLMs, i.e., LLM4Predict, holds
particular promise compared with LLM4Inspire, which offers general knowledge
within LLMs.
