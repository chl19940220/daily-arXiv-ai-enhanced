We conjecture that this observed improvement\nis partially due to the answer distribution of standard evaluation benchmarks,\nwhich is skewed towards a relatively small set of common answers. To test this\nconjecture, we define a baseline that enumerates answers according to their\nprevalence in the training set. Experiments spanning two domains --\nmathematical reasoning and factual knowledge -- reveal that this baseline\noutperforms repeated model sampling for some LLMs, while the coverage for\nothers is on par with that of a mixture strategy that obtains $k$ answers by\nusing only $10$ model samples and similarly guessing the remaining $k-10$\nattempts via enumeration. Our baseline enables a more accurate measurement of\nhow much repeated sampling improves coverage in such settings beyond\nprompt-agnostic guessing."}
