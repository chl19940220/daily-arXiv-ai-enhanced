Unlike traditional Large Language\nModels (LLMs), VLMs face unique vulnerabilities due to their multimodal nature,\nallowing adversaries to modify visual or textual inputs to bypass safety\nguardrails and trigger the generation of harmful content. Through systematic\nanalysis of VLM behavior under attack, we identify a novel phenomenon termed\n``delayed safety awareness''. Specifically, we observe that safety-aligned VLMs\nmay initially be compromised to produce harmful content, but eventually\nrecognize the associated risks and attempt to self-correct. This pattern\nsuggests that VLMs retain their underlying safety awareness but experience a\ntemporal delay in their activation. Building on this insight, we hypothesize\nthat VLMs' safety awareness can be proactively reactivated through carefully\ndesigned prompts. To this end, we introduce ``The Safety Reminder'', a soft\nprompt tuning approach that optimizes learnable prompt tokens, which are\nperiodically injected during the text generation process to enhance safety\nawareness, effectively preventing harmful content generation. Additionally, our\nsafety reminder only activates when harmful content is detected, leaving normal\nconversations unaffected and preserving the model's performance on benign\ntasks.

Prior\nresearch has revealed that LLMs often fail to grasp the notion of safe\nbehaviors, resulting in either unjustified refusals to harmless prompts or the\ngeneration of harmful content. While substantial efforts have been made to\nimprove their robustness, existing defenses often rely on costly fine-tuning of\nmodel parameters or employ suboptimal heuristic techniques. In this work, we\ntake a novel approach to safeguard LLMs by learning to adapt the system prompts\nin instruction-tuned LLMs. While LLMs are typically pre-trained to follow a\nfixed system prompt, we investigate the impact of tailoring the system prompt\nto each specific user input on the safety of the responses. To this end, we\npropose $\\textbf{Sysformer}$, a trans$\\textbf{former}$ model that updates an\ninitial $\\textbf{sys}$tem prompt to a more robust system prompt in the LLM\ninput embedding space while attending to the user prompt. While keeping the LLM\nparameters frozen, the Sysformer is trained to refuse to respond to a set of\nharmful prompts while responding ideally to a set of safe ones. Through\nextensive experiments on $5$ LLMs from different families and $2$ recent\nbenchmarks, we demonstrate that Sysformer can significantly enhance the\nrobustness of LLMs, leading to upto $80\\%$ gain in the refusal rate on harmful\nprompts while enhancing the compliance with the safe prompts by upto $90\\%$.\nResults also generalize well to sophisticated jailbreaking attacks, making LLMs\nupto $100\\%$ more robust against different attack strategies.

While\ntraditional techniques such as face blurring and obfuscation have been applied\nto mitigate privacy risks, individual privacy remains at risk, as individuals\ncan still be tracked using other features such as their clothing.

Furthermore, Mamba2 has demonstrated its\nsignificant potential in natural language processing tasks by explicitly\nmodeling the spatial adjacency prior through the structured mask. In this\npaper, we propose Polyline Path Masked Attention (PPMA) that integrates the\nself-attention mechanism of ViTs with an enhanced structured mask of Mamba2,\nharnessing the complementary strengths of both architectures. Specifically, we\nfirst ameliorate the traditional structured mask of Mamba2 by introducing a 2D\npolyline path scanning strategy and derive its corresponding structured mask,\npolyline path mask, which better preserves the adjacency relationships among\nimage tokens. Notably, we conduct a thorough theoretical analysis on the\nstructural characteristics of the proposed polyline path mask and design an\nefficient algorithm for the computation of the polyline path mask. Next, we\nembed the polyline path mask into the self-attention mechanism of ViTs,\nenabling explicit modeling of spatial adjacency prior. Extensive experiments on\nstandard benchmarks, including image classification, object detection, and\nsegmentation, demonstrate that our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art\napproaches based on both state-space models and Transformers. For example, our\nproposed PPMA-T/S/B models achieve 48.7%/51.1%/52.3% mIoU on the ADE20K\nsemantic segmentation task, surpassing RMT-T/S/B by 0.7%/1.3%/0.3%,\nrespectively.

Because of its\nunidirectional nature, each state in Mamba only has information of its previous\nstates and is blind to states after. Current Mamba-based computer-vision\nmethods typically overcome this limitation by augmenting Mamba's global forward\nscan with a global backward scan, forming a bi-directional scan that restores a\nfull receptive field. However, this operation doubles the computational load,\neroding much of the efficiency advantage that originally Mamba have. To\neliminate this extra scans, we introduce LBMamba, a locally bi-directional SSM\nblock that embeds a lightweight locally backward scan inside the forward\nselective scan and executes it entirely in per-thread registers. Building on\nLBMamba, we present LBVim, a scalable vision backbone that alternates scan\ndirections every two layers to recover a global receptive field without extra\nbackward sweeps.

In the proposed experiment\nparadigm, we see the addition of AADs across a range of detection accuracies\ncan improve performance over baseline; demonstrating a significant improvement\n-- such as a ~50% reduction in the mean along-track localization error -- can\nbe achieved with True Positive and False Positive detection rates of only 75%\nand up to 25% respectively. We examine a variety of metrics including:\nAlong-Track Error, Percentage of Time Attacked, Percentage of Time in an\n`Unsafe' State, and Longest Continuous Time Under Attack. Expanding further on\nthese results, we provide the first investigation into the efficacy of the Fast\nGradient Sign Method (FGSM) adversarial attack for VPR. The analysis in this\nwork highlights the need for AADs in real-world systems for trustworthy\nnavigation, and informs quantitative requirements for system design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u5730\u70b9\u8bc6\u522b\uff08VPR\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u5e38\u89c1\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u56db\u79cdVPR\u7279\u6709\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff08AAD\uff09\u548c\u4e3b\u52a8\u5bfc\u822a\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u7cfb\u7edf\u5982\u4f55\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "VPR\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bfc\u822a\u4e2d\u6613\u53d7\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e25\u91cd\u540e\u679c\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u9632\u5fa1\u63aa\u65bd\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u5e38\u89c1\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u56db\u79cdVPR\u7279\u6709\u653b\u51fb\u5bf9VPR\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408AAD\u548c\u4e3b\u52a8\u5bfc\u822a\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u7cfb\u7edf\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cAAD\u7684\u52a0\u5165\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u6cbf\u8f68\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u7ea650%\uff0c\u4e14\u4ec5\u970075%\u7684\u771f\u9633\u6027\u7387\u548c\u6700\u9ad825%\u7684\u5047\u9633\u6027\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86AAD\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5bfc\u822a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9a\u91cf\u8981\u6c42\u3002"}}

To\naddress this, prior research has explored techniques such as sparsification and\nquantization. However, these techniques face significant challenges under low\ndensity and reduced bitwidths. Through systematic analysis, we identify that\nthe core difficulty stems from the dispersed and irregular characteristics of\nvisual attention patterns. Therefore, instead of introducing specialized\nsparsification and quantization design to accommodate such patterns, we propose\nan alternative strategy: *reorganizing* the attention pattern to alleviate the\nchallenges. Inspired by the local aggregation nature of visual feature\nextraction, we design a novel **Pattern-Aware token ReOrdering (PARO)**\ntechnique, which unifies the diverse attention patterns into a\nhardware-friendly block-wise pattern.

However,\nexisting static, non-interactive evaluation paradigms fail to adequately assess\nrisks within these interactive environments, since they cannot simulate dynamic\nrisks that emerge from an agent's actions and rely on unreliable post-hoc\nevaluations that ignore unsafe intermediate steps. To bridge this critical gap,\nwe propose evaluating an agent's interactive safety: its ability to perceive\nemergent risks and execute mitigation steps in the correct procedural order.

Each component has been extensively studied, and in the backend\narchitecture, temporal convolutional networks (TCNs) have been widely adopted\nin state-of-the-art methods. Recently, dense skip connections have been\nintroduced in TCNs to mitigate the limited density of the receptive field,\nthereby improving the modeling of complex temporal representations. However,\ntheir performance remains constrained owing to potential information loss\nregarding the continuous nature of lip movements, caused by blind spots in the\nreceptive field. To address this limitation, we propose TD3Net, a temporal\ndensely connected multi-dilated convolutional network that combines dense skip\nconnections and multi-dilated temporal convolutions as the backend\narchitecture. TD3Net covers a wide and dense receptive field without blind\nspots by applying different dilation factors to skip-connected features.\nExperimental results on a word-level lipreading task using two large publicly\navailable datasets, Lip Reading in the Wild (LRW) and LRW-1000, indicate that\nthe proposed method achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art\nmethods. It achieved higher accuracy with fewer parameters and lower\nfloating-point operations compared to existing TCN-based backend architectures.\nMoreover, visualization results suggest that our approach effectively utilizes\ndiverse temporal features while preserving temporal continuity, presenting\nnotable advantages in lipreading systems.

Recently, FreeInit identified a training-inference gap and\nintroduced a method to iteratively refine the initial noise during inference.\nHowever, iterative refinement significantly increases the computational cost\nassociated with video generation. In this paper, we introduce FastInit, a fast\nnoise initialization method that eliminates the need for iterative refinement.\nFastInit learns a Video Noise Prediction Network (VNPNet) that takes random\nnoise and a text prompt as input, generating refined noise in a single forward\npass. Therefore, FastInit greatly enhances the efficiency of video generation\nwhile achieving high temporal consistency across frames. To train the VNPNet,\nwe create a large-scale dataset consisting of pairs of text prompts, random\nnoise, and refined noise.

Our results indicate that\neven state-of-the-art reasoning-oriented models, such as o4-mini and\nGemini-2.5-pro-exp, struggle with highly challenging competition-level\nproblems.

To overcome this issue,\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) complements the static training-derived\nknowledge of LLMs with an external knowledge repository. RAG consists of three\nstages: indexing, retrieval, and generation. The retrieval stage of RAG becomes\na significant bottleneck in inference pipelines. In this stage, a user query is\nmapped to an embedding vector and an Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS)\nalgorithm searches for similar vectors in the database to identify relevant\nitems. Due to the large database sizes, ANNS incurs significant data movement\noverheads between the host and the storage system. To alleviate these\noverheads, prior works propose In-Storage Processing (ISP) techniques that\naccelerate ANNS by performing computations inside storage. However, existing\nworks that leverage ISP for ANNS (i) employ algorithms that are not tailored to\nISP systems, (ii) do not accelerate data retrieval operations for data selected\nby ANNS, and (iii) introduce significant hardware modifications, limiting\nperformance and hindering their adoption. We propose REIS, the first ISP system\ntailored for RAG that addresses these limitations with three key mechanisms.\nFirst, REIS employs a database layout that links database embedding vectors to\ntheir associated documents, enabling efficient retrieval.

We\nconstruct patch-level matches using both 3D geometry and 2D image features.\nThese matches are refined via geometric consistency checks, followed by rigid\ntransformation estimation per match. Experimental results on two real-world\nlandslide datasets demonstrate that our method produces 3D displacement\nestimates with high spatial coverage (79% and 97%) and high accuracy.\nDeviations in displacement magnitude with respect to external measurements\n(total station or GNSS observations) are 0.15 m and 0.25 m on the two datasets,\nrespectively, and only 0.07 m and 0.20 m compared to manually derived\nreferences.

With MedPerturb, we release a dataset of 800 clinical contexts\ngrounded in realistic input variability, outputs from four LLMs, and three\nhuman expert reads per clinical context. We use MedPerturb in two case studies\nto reveal how shifts in gender identity cues, language style, or format reflect\ndiverging treatment selections between humans and LLMs. We find that LLMs are\nmore sensitive to gender and style perturbations while human annotators are\nmore sensitive to LLM-generated format perturbations such as clinical\nsummaries.

With limited\nsupport samples available, i) the adverse effect of the dual noises can be\nseverely amplified during task adaptation, and ii) the adapted model can\nproduce unreliable predictions on query samples in the presence of the dual\nnoises. In this work, we propose DEnoised Task Adaptation (DETA++) for reliable\nFSL. DETA++ uses a Contrastive Relevance Aggregation (CoRA) module to calculate\nimage and region weights for support samples, based on which a clean prototype\nloss and a noise entropy maximization loss are proposed to achieve noise-robust\ntask adaptation.

We propose a formal framework for evaluating whether\nan LLM exhibits a sufficiently robust world model, defined as producing\nconsistent outputs across semantically equivalent prompts while distinguishing\nbetween prompts that express different intents. We introduce a new evaluation\napproach to measure this that decomposes model response variability into three\ncomponents: variability due to user purpose, user articulation, and model\ninstability. An LLM with a strong world model should attribute most of the\nvariability in its responses to changes in foundational purpose rather than\nsuperficial changes in articulation. This approach allows us to quantify how\nmuch of a model's behavior is semantically grounded rather than driven by model\ninstability or alternative wording. We apply this framework to evaluate LLMs\nacross diverse domains. Our results show how larger models attribute a greater\nshare of output variability to changes in user purpose, indicating a more\nrobust world model. This improvement is not uniform, however: larger models do\nnot consistently outperform smaller ones across all domains, and their\nadvantage in robustness is often modest.

In this paper, we introduce a\ncomputational framework that models public perception across twelve dimensions,\nsuch as newsworthiness, importance, and surprisingness. Using this framework,\nwe create a large-scale science news perception dataset with 10,489 annotations\nfrom 2,101 participants from diverse US and UK populations, providing valuable\ninsights into public responses to scientific information across domains. We\nfurther develop NLP models that predict public perception scores with a strong\nperformance.

(2) Perception as a\npredictor: Can we use the estimated perceptions to predict public engagement\nwith science?

It has recently attracted surging\nacademic attention as a benchmark for Artificial Intelligence (AI). Although\nthere are various tasks for evaluating multimodal reasoning ability, they still\nhave limitations. Lack of reasoning on hierarchical visual clues at different\nlevels of granularity, e.g., local details and global context, is of little\ndiscussion, despite its frequent involvement in real scenarios. To bridge the\ngap, we introduce a novel and challenging task for multimodal reasoning, namely\nGeoGuess. Given a street view image, the task is to identify its location and\nprovide a detailed explanation. A system that succeeds in GeoGuess should be\nable to detect tiny visual clues, perceive the broader landscape, and associate\nwith vast geographic knowledge. Therefore, GeoGuess would require the ability\nto reason between hierarchical visual information and geographic knowledge.

Recent speech tokenization approaches aim\nto isolate semantic information from low-level acoustics to better align with\nlanguage models. In particular, previous methods use SSL teachers such as\nHuBERT to extract semantic representations, which are then distilled into a\nsemantic quantizer to suppress acoustic redundancy as well as capture\ncontent-related latent structures. However, they still produce speech token\nsequences significantly longer than their textual counterparts, creating\nchallenges for efficient speech-language modeling. Reducing the frame rate is a\nnatural solution, but standard techniques, such as rigid average pooling across\nframes, can distort or dilute the semantic structure required for effective LM\nalignment. To address this, we propose LM-SPT, a speech tokenization method\nthat introduces a novel semantic distillation.

We design GLMask, an image-mask\nrepresentation for the model to focus on shape, texture, and pattern while\nminimizing its dependence on color features. We develop a pipeline to generate\nsemantic segmentation and then transform it into instance-level segmentation.\nThe proposed approach substantially outperforms the conventional instance\nsegmentation models, establishing a state-of-the-art wheat head instance\nsegmentation model with mAP@50 of 98.5%. Additionally, we assessed the proposed\nmethodology on the general-purpose Microsoft COCO dataset, achieving a\nsignificant performance improvement of over 12.6% mAP@50.

While\nrecent AI models have shown promise in detecting such patterns from patient\nfacial videos, their reliance on real patient data raises significant ethical\nand privacy challenges -- especially when training robust and generalizable\nmodels across institutions. To address these concerns, we propose SafeTriage, a\nnovel method designed to de-identify patient facial videos while preserving\nessential motion cues crucial for stroke diagnosis. SafeTriage leverages a\npretrained video motion transfer (VMT) model to map the motion characteristics\nof real patient faces onto synthetic identities. This approach retains\ndiagnostically relevant facial dynamics without revealing the patients'\nidentities. To mitigate the distribution shift between normal population\npre-training videos and patient population test videos, we introduce a\nconditional generative model for visual prompt tuning, which adapts the input\nspace of the VMT model to ensure accurate motion transfer without needing to\nfine-tune the VMT model backbone. Comprehensive evaluation, including\nquantitative metrics and clinical expert assessments, demonstrates that\nSafeTriage-produced synthetic videos effectively preserve stroke-relevant\nfacial patterns, enabling reliable AI-based triage.

All groups received non-LLM corrective feedback. To address\npotential selection bias-where higher-performing learners may be more inclined\nto use LLM feedback-we applied propensity scoring. Learners with a higher\npredicted likelihood of engaging with LLM feedback scored significantly higher\nat posttest than those with lower propensity.

Recently, text-guided IVF has shown great potential due\nto its flexibility and versatility. However, the effective integration and\nutilization of textual semantic information remains insufficiently studied. To\ntackle these challenges, we introduce textual semantics at two levels: the mask\nsemantic level and the text semantic level, both derived from textual\ndescriptions extracted by large Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Building on\nthis, we propose Textual Semantic Guidance for infrared and visible image\nfusion, termed TeSG, which guides the image synthesis process in a way that is\noptimized for downstream tasks such as detection and segmentation.\nSpecifically, TeSG consists of three core components: a Semantic Information\nGenerator (SIG), a Mask-Guided Cross-Attention (MGCA) module, and a Text-Driven\nAttentional Fusion (TDAF) module. The SIG generates mask and text semantics\nbased on textual descriptions.

This capability is foundational in\n3D vision and robotic perception. Despite significant progress in vision\nlearning, it remains unclear whether current vision models have reached\nhuman-level proficiency in co-visibility analysis. In this work, we introduce\nthe Co-Visibility reasONing (Co-VisiON) benchmark, designed to directly\nevaluate co-visibility reasoning on sparse image sets across over 1000 indoor\nscenarios. Our experiments reveal that while co-visibility is typically treated\nas a low-level feature matching task, it poses a significant challenge for\nexisting vision models under sparse conditions. Notably, a proprietary\nvision-language model outperforms all purely vision-based approaches, with all\nmodels lagging substantially behind human performance. This gap underscores the\nneed for more than basic pairwise vision processing-it calls for a\ncomprehensive spatial understanding through high-level reasoning across\nmultiple views. Inspired by human visual cognition, we propose a novel\nmulti-view baseline, Covis, which achieves top performance among pure vision\nmodels and narrows the gap to the proprietary VLM.

Conversely, domain translation alone\ncannot accurately approximate real-world blur characteristics due to the\nsignificant degradation domain gap between synthetic and real data. To address\nthese challenges, we propose a novel TripleGAN framework comprising two\nstrategically designed components: The FirstGAN primarily focuses on narrowing\nthe domain gap in blur characteristics, while the SecondGAN performs\ndomain-specific translation to approximate target-domain blur properties and\nlearn additional degradation patterns. The ThirdGAN is trained on pseudo-real\ndata generated by the FirstGAN and SecondGAN to reconstruct real-world LR\nimages. Extensive experiments on the RealSR and DRealSR datasets demonstrate\nthat our method exhibits clear advantages in quantitative metrics while\nmaintaining sharp reconstructions without over-smoothing artifacts. The\nproposed framework effectively learns real-world degradation patterns from LR\nobservations and synthesizes aligned datasets with corresponding degradation\ncharacteristics, thereby enabling the trained network to achieve superior\nperformance in reconstructing high-quality SR images from real-world LR inputs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faTripleGAN\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2aGAN\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5206\u522b\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u7cca\u57df\u5dee\u8ddd\u3001\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7ffb\u8bd1\u548c\u4f2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u9000\u5316\u6a21\u5f0f\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u9f50\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u91cd\u5efa\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u91cd\u5efa\u4f9d\u8d56\u53cd\u6620\u771f\u5b9e\u9000\u5316\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4f46\u4ec5\u7528\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u63d0\u53d6\u9000\u5316\u6a21\u5f0f\u6216\u4ec5\u7528\u57df\u7ffb\u8bd1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5747\u65e0\u6cd5\u5168\u9762\u6355\u6349\u6a21\u7cca\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u9000\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTripleGAN\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542bFirstGAN\uff08\u7f29\u5c0f\u6a21\u7cca\u57df\u5dee\u8ddd\uff09\u3001SecondGAN\uff08\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7ffb\u8bd1\u5b66\u4e60\u989d\u5916\u9000\u5316\u6a21\u5f0f\uff09\u548cThirdGAN\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u5efa\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728RealSR\u548cDRealSR\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9a\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u91cd\u5efa\u7ed3\u679c\u6e05\u6670\u4e14\u65e0\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\u4f2a\u5f71\u3002", "conclusion": "TripleGAN\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u771f\u5b9e\u9000\u5316\u6a21\u5f0f\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u9f50\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u771f\u5b9e\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

An ablation study on our Driving Scene\nIdentification (DSI) dataset demonstrates a 56.1% performance increase over the\nbaseline model pretrained on ImageNet.

We believe our work offers crucial insights into\nthe inner workings of video DiTs and establishes a foundation for further\nresearch and applications leveraging their temporal understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "DiffTrack\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08DiTs\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u5efa\u7acb\u548c\u8868\u793a\u5e27\u95f4\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5e26\u4f2a\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7279\u5b9a\u5c42\u4e2d\u7684\u67e5\u8be2-\u952e\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5339\u914d\u4e2d\u8d77\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002DiffTrack\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u70b9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08DiTs\uff09\u5185\u90e8\u5982\u4f55\u5efa\u7acb\u548c\u8868\u793a\u5e27\u95f4\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5e26\u4f2a\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790DiTs\u76843D\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\u5404\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff08\u5982\u8868\u793a\u3001\u5c42\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\uff09\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u7279\u5b9a\u5c42\u4e2d\u7684\u67e5\u8be2-\u952e\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5339\u914d\u4e2d\u8d77\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u9010\u6e10\u663e\u8457\u3002DiffTrack\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u70b9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u6210\u529f\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "DiffTrack\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u89c6\u9891DiTs\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u5176\u65f6\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Current language model-based navigation systems operate on\ndiscrete topological graphs, limiting path planning to predefined node\nconnections.

To enable effective training, we first construct the VLN-Ego\ndataset using a 3D simulator, Habitat, and propose Long-Short Memory Sampling\nto balance historical and current observations. While large language models can\nsupervise complete textual instructions, they lack fine-grained action-level\ncontrol. Our framework employs a two-stage training approach: a) Supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT) to align the model's action sequence text predictions with\nexpert demonstrations, followed by b) Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) enhanced\nwith a Time-Decayed Reward (TDR) mechanism that strategically weights\nmulti-step future actions.
