Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has drawn tremendous attention recently. Many
works focus on using modular deep neural networks to construct the end-to-end
archi-tecture. However, whether using powerful large language models (LLM),
especially multi-modality Vision Language Models (VLM) could benefit the
end-to-end driving tasks remain a question. In our work, we demonstrate that
combining end-to-end architectural design and knowledgeable VLMs yield
impressive performance on the driving tasks. It is worth noting that our method
only uses a single camera and is the best camera-only solution across the
leaderboard, demonstrating the effectiveness of vision-based driving approach
and the potential for end-to-end driving tasks.

*Mennatullah Siam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了MoCentric-Bench基准测试，用于评估视频多模态大语言模型在像素级视觉定位中对运动信息的理解能力，发现现有基准存在缺陷并提出了运动中心化的评估方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频多模态大语言模型在像素级视觉定位方面的能力研究不足，特别是对运动信息的利用。现有基准测试往往可以通过单帧图像就能完成任务，无法真正评估模型对时序运动的理解。

Method: 提出了四种运动中心化的探测技术，设计了一个运动中心的基准测试MoCentric-Bench，确保评估模型对运动与语言交互的理解，而非仅依赖静态外观线索。

Result: 建立了强大的单图像基线方法，其性能与现有方法相当或更好。探索了简单的运动中心化适应技术，在MoCentric-Bench上达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究挑战未来模型改进密集时空定位和像素级视频理解能力，提出的基准测试和评估方法将推动视频MLLMs在运动理解方面的发展。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive
generalization across tasks using images and text modalities. While their
extension to video has enabled tasks such as video question answering and video
captioning, their pixel-level visual grounding abilities are less studied. In
this work, we raise the pertinent question of whether motion is used in
pixel-level visual grounding and whether video MLLMs can segment objects based
on natural language expressions describing their motion patterns. We identify
the shortcomings in the current benchmarks, where we show that a single frame
can often suffice for capturing the motion referring expression without any
temporal reasoning. To address this, we introduce four motion-centric probing
techniques, particularly designed for the visual grounding task, to study video
MLLMs' ability to identify true motion from a fake one and their ability to
grasp the motion order. Consequently, we provide a motion-centric benchmark,
MoCentric-Bench. It ensures that video MLLMs are evaluated towards leveraging
the interaction between motion and language rather than being dominated by
static appearance cues emphasized in existing visual grounding datasets. We
further establish strong single-image baselines that are on par with or
outperform prior methods. Finally, we explore simple motion-centric adaptation
techniques that provide state-of-the-art performance on our MoCentric-Bench.
Our motion-centric benchmark, evaluation and findings challenge future models
to improve dense spatiotemporal grounding and pixel-level understanding within
videos. Code and datasets will be made publicly available at

Abstract: Colon cancer also known as Colorectal cancer, is one of the most malignant
types of cancer worldwide. Early-stage detection of colon cancer is highly
crucial to prevent its deterioration. This research presents a hybrid
multi-scale deep learning architecture that synergizes capsule networks, graph
attention mechanisms, transformer modules, and residual learning to advance
colon cancer classification on the Lung and Colon Cancer Histopathological
Image Dataset (LC25000) dataset. The proposed model in this paper utilizes the
HG-TNet model that introduces a hybrid architecture that joins strength points
in transformers and convolutional neural networks to capture multi-scale
features in histopathological images. Mainly, a transformer branch extracts
global contextual bonds by partitioning the image into patches by
convolution-based patch embedding and then processing these patches through a
transformer encoder. Analogously, a dedicated CNN branch captures fine-grained,
local details through successive Incorporation these diverse features, combined
with a self-supervised rotation prediction objective, produce a robust
diagnostic representation that surpasses standard architectures in performance.
Results show better performance not only in accuracy or loss function but also
in these algorithms by utilizing capsule networks to preserve spatial orders
and realize how each element individually combines and forms whole structures.

Motivation: 解决主动脉狭窄诊断中超声心动图资源有限的问题，特别是在农村和服务不足地区，点式护理超声虽然更易获得但受限于操作者专业知识和视图选择

Method: 使用强化学习驱动的主动视频采集框架，动态评估是否需要额外成像，优化选择每个患者最具信息量的超声视频，相比传统固定视频集方法更加灵活

Result: 在2,572名患者数据上测试，方法达到80.6%分类准确率，仅使用47%的超声视频（相比完整采集），显著提高诊断效率

Conclusion: 主动特征采集方法有潜力增强主动脉狭窄诊断，使超声心动图评估更加高效、可扩展和个性化

Abstract: Aortic stenosis (AS) is a life-threatening condition caused by a narrowing of
the aortic valve, leading to impaired blood flow. Despite its high prevalence,
access to echocardiography (echo), the gold-standard diagnostic tool, is often
limited due to resource constraints, particularly in rural and underserved
areas. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) offers a more accessible alternative
but is restricted by operator expertise and the challenge of selecting the most
relevant imaging views. To address this, we propose a reinforcement learning
(RL)-driven active video acquisition framework that dynamically selects each
patient's most informative echo videos. Unlike traditional methods that rely on
a fixed set of videos, our approach continuously evaluates whether additional
imaging is needed, optimizing both accuracy and efficiency. Tested on data from
2,572 patients, our method achieves 80.6% classification accuracy while using
only 47% of the echo videos compared to a full acquisition. These results
demonstrate the potential of active feature acquisition to enhance AS
diagnosis, making echocardiographic assessments more efficient, scalable, and
personalized. Our source code is available at:

Abstract: There is a growing interest in the development of lidar-based autonomous
mobility and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). To operate and research
on lidar data, researchers often develop code specific to application niche.
This approach leads to duplication of efforts across studies that, in many
cases, share multiple methodological steps such as data input/output (I/O),
pre/post processing, and common algorithms in multi-stage solutions. Moreover,
slight changes in data, algorithms, and/or research focus may force major
revisions in the code. To address these challenges, we present LiGuard, an
open-source software framework that allows researchers to: 1) rapidly develop
code for their lidar-based projects by providing built-in support for data I/O,
pre/post processing, and commonly used algorithms, 2) interactively
add/remove/reorder custom algorithms and adjust their parameters, and 3)
visualize results for classification, detection, segmentation, and tracking
tasks. Moreover, because it creates all the code files in structured
directories, it allows easy sharing of entire projects or even the individual
components to be reused by other researchers. The effectiveness of LiGuard is
demonstrated via case studies.

Abstract: LiDAR-based perception in intelligent transportation systems (ITS), for tasks
such as object detection, tracking, and semantic and instance segmentation, is
predominantly solved by deep neural network models which often require
large-scale labeled datasets during training to achieve generalization.
However, creating these datasets is costly. time consuming and require human
labor before the datasets are ready for training models. This hinders
scalability of the LiDAR-based perception systems in ITS. Sim2Real learning
offers scalable alternative, however, its effectiveness is dependent on the
fidelity of the source simulation(s) to real-world, in terms of environment
structure, actor dynamics, and sensor emulations. In response, this paper
introduces a rigorous and reproducible methodology for creating large-scale,
high-quality synthetic datasets using High-Fidelity Digital Twins (HiFi DTs).
The proposed workflow outlines the steps, tools, and best practices for
digitally replicating real-world environments, encompassing static geometry
modeling, road infrastructure replication, and dynamic traffic scenario
generation. Leveraging open-source and readily available resources such as
satellite imagery and OpenStreetMap data, alongside specific sensor
configurations, this paper provides practical, detailed guidance for
constructing robust synthetic environments. These environments subsequently
facilitate scalable, cost-effective, and diverse dataset generation, forming a
reliable foundation for robust Sim2Real learning.

Abstract: Sim2Real domain transfer offers a cost-effective and scalable approach for
developing LiDAR-based perception (e.g., object detection, tracking,
segmentation) in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). However, perception
models trained in simulation often under perform on real-world data due to
distributional shifts. To address this Sim2Real gap, this paper proposes a
high-fidelity digital twin (HiFi DT) framework that incorporates real-world
background geometry, lane-level road topology, and sensor-specific
specifications and placement. We formalize the domain adaptation challenge
underlying Sim2Real learning and present a systematic method for constructing
simulation environments that yield in-domain synthetic data. An off-the-shelf
3D object detector is trained on HiFi DT-generated synthetic data and evaluated
on real data. Our experiments show that the DT-trained model outperforms the
equivalent model trained on real data by 4.8%. To understand this gain, we
quantify distributional alignment between synthetic and real data using
multiple metrics, including Chamfer Distance (CD), Maximum Mean Discrepancy
(MMD), Earth Mover's Distance (EMD), and Fr'echet Distance (FD), at both
raw-input and latent-feature levels. Results demonstrate that HiFi DTs
substantially reduce domain shift and improve generalization across diverse
evaluation scenarios. These findings underscore the significant role of digital
twins in enabling reliable, simulation-based LiDAR perception for real-world
ITS applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KG-DG是一个神经符号框架，通过整合视觉变换器和专家指导的符号推理，在糖尿病视网膜病变分类中实现了跨域泛化，准确率提升最高达5.2%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学影像中模型在真实世界分布偏移下泛化能力不足的问题，特别是在糖尿病视网膜病变分类中的域泛化挑战。

Method: 提出神经符号框架，结合视觉变换器和基于临床病变本体的符号推理，通过KL散度最小化域嵌入对齐，采用置信度加权集成策略融合深度视觉表示和结构化特征。

Conclusion: 神经符号集成是构建临床鲁棒、域不变医学AI系统的有前景范式，符号组件不仅是可解释性增强，更是有效的正则化器。

Abstract: Domain generalization remains a critical challenge in medical imaging, where
models trained on single sources often fail under real-world distribution
shifts. We propose KG-DG, a neuro-symbolic framework for diabetic retinopathy
(DR) classification that integrates vision transformers with expert-guided
symbolic reasoning to enable robust generalization across unseen domains. Our
approach leverages clinical lesion ontologies through structured, rule-based
features and retinal vessel segmentation, fusing them with deep visual
representations via a confidence-weighted integration strategy. The framework
addresses both single-domain generalization (SDG) and multi-domain
generalization (MDG) by minimizing the KL divergence between domain embeddings,
thereby enforcing alignment of high-level clinical semantics. Extensive
experiments across four public datasets (APTOS, EyePACS, Messidor-1,
Messidor-2) demonstrate significant improvements: up to a 5.2% accuracy gain in
cross-domain settings and a 6% improvement over baseline ViT models. Notably,
our symbolic-only model achieves a 63.67% average accuracy in MDG, while the
complete neuro-symbolic integration achieves the highest accuracy compared to
existing published baselines and benchmarks in challenging SDG scenarios.
Ablation studies reveal that lesion-based features (84.65% accuracy)
substantially outperform purely neural approaches, confirming that symbolic
components act as effective regularizers beyond merely enhancing
interpretability. Our findings establish neuro-symbolic integration as a
promising paradigm for building clinically robust, and domain-invariant medical
AI systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STAR是一个快速、轻量级的开源框架，用于全切片组织病理图像的刚性配准，特别适用于连续切片的多染色对齐，具有分层相关策略和内置质量控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的序列全切片组织病理图像配准方法通常依赖计算密集型且难以复现的复杂变形或深度学习方法，而适用于连续切片场景的轻量级刚性配准框架发展不足。

Method: STAR整合了染色条件预处理、分层粗到细相关策略、自适应核缩放和内置质量控制，实现跨异质组织类型和染色协议的可靠刚性配准。

Conclusion: STAR作为一个开源轻量级工具，为临床采用降低了门槛，并为下一代计算病理学的大规模配对数据准备提供了可复现的基准。

Abstract: Registration of serial whole-slide histopathological images (WSIs) is
critical for enabling direct comparison across diverse stains and for preparing
paired datasets in artificial intelligence (AI) workflows such as virtual
staining and biomarker prediction. While existing methods often rely on complex
deformable or deep learning approaches that are computationally intensive and
difficult to reproduce, lightweight rigid frameworks-sufficient for many
consecutive-section scenarios-remain underdeveloped. We introduce STAR (Serial
Tissue Alignment for Rigid registration), a fast and robust open-source
framework for multi-WSI alignment. STAR integrates stain-conditioned
preprocessing with a hierarchical coarse-to-fine correlation strategy, adaptive
kernel scaling, and built-in quality control, achieving reliable rigid
registration across heterogeneous tissue types and staining protocols,
including hematoxylin-eosin (H&E), special histochemical stains (e.g., PAS,
PASM, Masson's), and immunohistochemical (IHC) markers (e.g., CD31, KI67).
Evaluated on the ANHIR 2019 and ACROBAT 2022 datasets spanning multiple organs
and scanning conditions, STAR consistently produced stable alignments within
minutes per slide, demonstrating robustness to cross-stain variability and
partial tissue overlap. Beyond benchmarks, we present case studies on H&E-IHC
alignment, construction of multi-IHC panels, and typical failure modes,
underscoring both utility and limitations. Released as an open and lightweight
tool, STAR provides a reproducible baseline that lowers the barrier for
clinical adoption and enables large-scale paired data preparation for
next-generation computational pathology.

Abstract: Multimodal industrial surface defect detection (MISDD) aims to identify and
locate defect in industrial products by fusing RGB and 3D modalities. This
article focuses on modality-missing problems caused by uncertain sensors
availability in MISDD. In this context, the fusion of multiple modalities
encounters several troubles, including learning mode transformation and
information vacancy. To this end, we first propose cross-modal prompt learning,
which includes: i) the cross-modal consistency prompt serves the establishment
of information consistency of dual visual modalities; ii) the modality-specific
prompt is inserted to adapt different input patterns; iii) the missing-aware
prompt is attached to compensate for the information vacancy caused by dynamic
modalities-missing. In addition, we propose symmetric contrastive learning,
which utilizes text modality as a bridge for fusion of dual vision modalities.
Specifically, a paired antithetical text prompt is designed to generate binary
text semantics, and triple-modal contrastive pre-training is offered to
accomplish multimodal learning. Experiment results show that our proposed
method achieves 73.83% I-AUROC and 93.05% P-AUROC with a total missing rate 0.7
for RGB and 3D modalities (exceeding state-of-the-art methods 3.84% and 5.58%
respectively), and outperforms existing approaches to varying degrees under
different missing types and rates. The source code will be available at

### [12] [EdgeAttNet: Towards Barb-Aware Filament Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02964)
*Victor Solomon,Piet Martens,Jingyu Liu,Rafal Angryk*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EdgeAttNet是一种基于U-Net的太阳细丝分割架构，通过引入可学习的边缘图来增强自注意力机制，显著提高了细丝边界和分支的识别精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以捕捉太阳细丝中的精细结构（特别是分支），主要原因是缺乏对长距离依赖关系和空间细节的建模能力。

Method: 在U-Net主干网络上引入直接从输入图像派生的可学习边缘图，通过线性变换将边缘信息融入注意力机制的Key和Query矩阵中，指导网络瓶颈处的自注意力更有效地捕捉细丝边界。

Result: 在MAGFILO数据集上，EdgeAttNet超越了U-Net和其他基于U-Net的transformer基线，实现了更高的分割精度和显著更好的细丝分支识别能力，同时推理速度更快。

Conclusion: 通过将结构先验显式整合到注意力计算中，EdgeAttNet在减少可训练参数的同时提高了空间敏感性和分割精度，适合实际部署应用。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of solar filaments in H-alpha observations is critical
for determining filament chirality, a key factor in the behavior of Coronal
Mass Ejections (CMEs). However, existing methods often fail to capture
fine-scale filament structures, particularly barbs, due to a limited ability to
model long-range dependencies and spatial detail.
  We propose EdgeAttNet, a segmentation architecture built on a U-Net backbone
by introducing a novel, learnable edge map derived directly from the input
image. This edge map is incorporated into the model by linearly transforming
the attention Key and Query matrices with the edge information, thereby guiding
the self-attention mechanism at the network's bottleneck to more effectively
capture filament boundaries and barbs. By explicitly integrating this
structural prior into the attention computations, EdgeAttNet enhances spatial
sensitivity and segmentation accuracy while reducing the number of trainable
parameters.
  Trained end-to-end, EdgeAttNet outperforms U-Net and other U-Net-based
transformer baselines on the MAGFILO dataset. It achieves higher segmentation
accuracy and significantly better recognition of filament barbs, with faster
inference performance suitable for practical deployment.

Abstract: Accurate short-horizon trajectory prediction is pivotal for safe and reliable
autonomous driving, yet existing vision-language models (VLMs) often fail to
effectively ground their reasoning in scene dynamics and domain knowledge. To
address this challenge, this paper introduces KEPT, a knowledge-enhanced VLM
framework that predicts ego trajectories directly from consecutive front-view
driving frames. KEPT couples a temporal frequency-spatial fusion (TFSF) video
encoder, trained via self-supervised learning with hard-negative mining, with a
scalable k-means + HNSW retrieval stack that supplies scene-aligned exemplars.
Retrieved priors are embedded into chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts with explicit
planning constraints, while a triple-stage fine-tuning schedule incrementally
aligns the language head to metric spatial cues, physically feasible motion,
and temporally conditioned front-view planning. Evaluated on nuScenes dataset,
KEPT achieves state-of-the-art performance across open-loop protocols: under
NoAvg, it achieves 0.70m average L2 with a 0.21\% collision rate; under TemAvg
with lightweight ego status, it attains 0.31m average L2 and a 0.07\% collision
rate. Ablation studies show that all three fine-tuning stages contribute
complementary benefits, and that using Top-2 retrieved exemplars yields the

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstaDA是一个无需训练的双智能体系统，通过文本智能体和图像智能体协作增强实例分割数据集，在LVIS 1.0验证集上取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实例分割数据标注成本高、类别不平衡的问题，现有方法缺乏大语言模型与扩散模型的深度协作，且未充分利用现有训练数据的丰富信息。

Method: 提出双智能体系统：1) 文本智能体(T-Agent)通过Prompt Rethink机制迭代优化提示词，促进LLM与扩散模型协作；2) 图像智能体(I-Agent)基于训练图像生成新实例来丰富数据分布。两个智能体都是独立自动的工作流。

Conclusion: InstaDA通过双智能体协作有效增强了实例分割数据集，提高了模型性能，证明了训练数据信息充分利用和大语言模型与扩散模型深度协作的重要性。

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality instance segmentation data is challenging due to the
labor-intensive nature of the annotation process and significant class
imbalances within datasets. Recent studies have utilized the integration of
Copy-Paste and diffusion models to create more diverse datasets. However, these
studies often lack deep collaboration between large language models (LLMs) and
diffusion models, and underutilize the rich information within the existing
training data. To address these limitations, we propose InstaDA, a novel,
training-free Dual-Agent system designed to augment instance segmentation
datasets. First, we introduce a Text-Agent (T-Agent) that enhances data
diversity through collaboration between LLMs and diffusion models. This agent
features a novel Prompt Rethink mechanism, which iteratively refines prompts
based on the generated images. This process not only fosters collaboration but
also increases image utilization and optimizes the prompts themselves.
Additionally, we present an Image-Agent (I-Agent) aimed at enriching the
overall data distribution. This agent augments the training set by generating
new instances conditioned on the training images. To ensure practicality and
efficiency, both agents operate as independent and automated workflows,
enhancing usability. Experiments conducted on the LVIS 1.0 validation set
indicate that InstaDA achieves significant improvements, with an increase of
+4.0 in box average precision (AP) and +3.3 in mask AP compared to the
baseline. Furthermore, it outperforms the leading model, DiverGen, by +0.3 in
box AP and +0.1 in mask AP, with a notable +0.7 gain in box AP on common
categories and mask AP gains of +0.2 on common categories and +0.5 on frequent
categories.

TL;DR: 提出SPENet网络解决少样本医学图像分割问题，通过多级原型生成和查询引导的局部原型增强，有效处理类内差异和支撑-查询图像差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于原型的方法通常为支撑图像生成单一全局原型来匹配查询图像，忽略了类内变化，当支撑和查询图像存在显著差异时效果不佳。

Method: 提出SPENet网络，包含多级原型生成模块（同时生成全局原型和自适应数量的局部原型）和查询引导的局部原型增强模块（根据查询图像自适应优化支撑原型）。

Result: 在三个公共医学数据集上的大量实验表明，SPENet优于现有最先进方法，实现了卓越性能。

Conclusion: SPENet通过多粒度原型匹配和查询引导的原型增强，有效解决了少样本医学图像分割中的类内变化和图像差异问题。

Abstract: Few-Shot Medical Image Segmentation (FSMIS) aims to segment novel classes of
medical objects using only a few labeled images. Prototype-based methods have
made significant progress in addressing FSMIS. However, they typically generate
a single global prototype for the support image to match with the query image,
overlooking intra-class variations. To address this issue, we propose a
Self-guided Prototype Enhancement Network (SPENet). Specifically, we introduce
a Multi-level Prototype Generation (MPG) module, which enables
multi-granularity measurement between the support and query images by
simultaneously generating a global prototype and an adaptive number of local
prototypes. Additionally, we observe that not all local prototypes in the
support image are beneficial for matching, especially when there are
substantial discrepancies between the support and query images. To alleviate
this issue, we propose a Query-guided Local Prototype Enhancement (QLPE)
module, which adaptively refines support prototypes by incorporating guidance
from the query image, thus mitigating the negative effects of such
discrepancies. Extensive experiments on three public medical datasets
demonstrate that SPENet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods,
achieving superior performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感图像中的小目标实例分割研究不足，缺乏专用数据集，且SAM等现有模型在小目标分割上性能显著下降

Result: SOPSeg在小目标分割方面优于现有方法，并支持高效的遥感数据集构建

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了小目标分割的技术挑战，构建了专用数据集，将发布模型和数据集支持未来研究

Abstract: Extracting small objects from remote sensing imagery plays a vital role in
various applications, including urban planning, environmental monitoring, and
disaster management. While current research primarily focuses on small object
detection, instance segmentation for small objects remains underexplored, with
no dedicated datasets available. This gap stems from the technical challenges
and high costs of pixel-level annotation for small objects. While the Segment
Anything Model (SAM) demonstrates impressive zero-shot generalization, its
performance on small-object segmentation deteriorates significantly, largely
due to the coarse 1/16 feature resolution that causes severe loss of fine
spatial details. To this end, we propose SOPSeg, a prompt-based framework
specifically designed for small object segmentation in remote sensing imagery.
It incorporates a region-adaptive magnification strategy to preserve
fine-grained details, and employs a customized decoder that integrates edge
prediction and progressive refinement for accurate boundary delineation.
Moreover, we introduce a novel prompting mechanism tailored to the oriented
bounding boxes widely adopted in remote sensing applications. SOPSeg
outperforms existing methods in small object segmentation and facilitates
efficient dataset construction for remote sensing tasks. We further construct a
comprehensive small object instance segmentation dataset based on SODA-A, and
will release both the model and dataset to support future research.

Conclusion: 集成攻击网络训练能有效增强后处理水印的鲁棒性，空间域CNN与频域Transformer的组合是最优攻击网络配置。

Abstract: Recent studies on deep watermarking have predominantly focused on
in-processing watermarking, which integrates the watermarking process into
image generation. However, post-processing watermarking, which embeds
watermarks after image generation, offers more flexibility. It can be applied
to outputs from any generative model (e.g. GANs, diffusion models) without
needing access to the model's internal structure. It also allows users to embed
unique watermarks into individual images. Therefore, this study focuses on
post-processing watermarking and enhances its robustness by incorporating an
ensemble attack network during training. We construct various versions of
attack networks using CNN and Transformer in both spatial and frequency domains
to investigate how each combination influences the robustness of the
watermarking model. Our results demonstrate that combining a CNN-based attack
network in the spatial domain with a Transformer-based attack network in the
frequency domain yields the highest robustness in watermarking models.
Extensive evaluation on the WAVES benchmark, using average bit accuracy as the
metric, demonstrates that our ensemble attack network significantly enhances
the robustness of baseline watermarking methods under various stress tests. In
particular, for the Regeneration Attack defined in WAVES, our method improves
StegaStamp by 18.743%. The code is released

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在处理多模态输入时，经常错误地将文本描述中缺乏视觉证据的概念误认为是图像中实际存在的内容，这导致了不准确的响应。研究旨在解决这一关键问题。

Method: 1) 识别出特定的视觉缺失感知(VA)神经元；2) 开发检测模块来分类输入token是否具有视觉基础；3) 基于预测结果重新解释问题提示或在生成过程中替换检测到的缺失token

Result: 实验表明该方法有效减轻了模型错误假设文本输入具有视觉存在的倾向，且在不同LVLMs上具有通用性

Conclusion: 通过识别和利用VA神经元的激活模式，可以系统性地检测和纠正LVLMs对视觉缺失概念的误判，显著提高模型输出的准确性

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) generate contextually relevant responses
by jointly interpreting visual and textual inputs. However, our finding reveals
they often mistakenly perceive text inputs lacking visual evidence as being
part of the image, leading to erroneous responses. In light of this finding, we
probe whether LVLMs possess an internal capability to determine if textual
concepts are grounded in the image, and discover a specific subset of
Feed-Forward Network (FFN) neurons, termed Visual Absence-aware (VA) neurons,
that consistently signal the visual absence through a distinctive activation
pattern. Leveraging these patterns, we develop a detection module that
systematically classifies whether an input token is visually grounded. Guided
by its prediction, we propose a method to refine the outputs by reinterpreting
question prompts or replacing the detected absent tokens during generation.
Extensive experiments show that our method effectively mitigates the models'
tendency to falsely presume the visual presence of text input and its
generality across various LVLMs.

Conclusion: 同时模型化前景和背景信息并通过两种语义学习策略来区分两者，能够有效提升人员重识别的性能

Abstract: Person re-identification faces two core challenges: precisely locating the
foreground target while suppressing background noise and extracting
fine-grained features from the target region. Numerous visual-only approaches
address these issues by partitioning an image and applying attention modules,
yet they rely on costly manual annotations and struggle with complex
occlusions. Recent multimodal methods, motivated by CLIP, introduce semantic
cues to guide visual understanding. However, they focus solely on foreground
information, but overlook the potential value of background cues. Inspired by
human perception, we argue that background semantics are as important as the
foreground semantics in ReID, as humans tend to eliminate background
distractions while focusing on target appearance. Therefore, this paper
proposes an end-to-end framework that jointly models foreground and background
information within a dual-branch cross-modal feature extraction pipeline. To
help the network distinguish between the two domains, we propose an
intra-semantic alignment and inter-semantic adversarial learning strategy.
Specifically, we align visual and textual features that share the same
semantics across domains, while simultaneously penalizing similarity between
foreground and background features to enhance the network's discriminative
power. This strategy drives the model to actively suppress noisy background
regions and enhance attention toward identity-relevant foreground cues.
Comprehensive experiments on two holistic and two occluded ReID benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed method, with
results that match or surpass those of current state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Accurate skin-lesion segmentation remains a key technical challenge for
computer-aided diagnosis of skin cancer. Convolutional neural networks, while
effective, are constrained by limited receptive fields and thus struggle to
model long-range dependencies. Vision Transformers capture global context, yet
their quadratic complexity and large parameter budgets hinder use on the

segmentation that achieves high precision through hierarchical feature
extraction and multi-scale context aggregation. The encoder stacks depth-wise
Mobile Inverted Bottleneck blocks to curb computation, inserts a
bottleneck-level cross-scale token-mixing unit to exchange information between
resolutions, and embeds a boundary-aware self-attention module to sharpen
lesion contours.

Conclusion: 该动态条件双激洞桥训练范式为不良多任务构建了一个通用框架，通过解耦激洞和条件生成过程，以及使用动态条件来调整统计特征，有效解决了传统方法在这些场景中的限制。

Abstract: Conditional diffusion models have made impressive progress in the field of
image processing, but the characteristics of constructing data distribution
pathways make it difficult to exploit the intrinsic correlation between tasks
in multi-task scenarios, which is even worse in ill-posed tasks with a lack of
training data. In addition, traditional static condition control makes it
difficult for networks to learn in multi-task scenarios with its dynamically
evolving characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose a dynamic
conditional double diffusion bridge training paradigm to build a general
framework for ill-posed multi-tasks. Firstly, this paradigm decouples the
diffusion and condition generation processes, avoiding the dependence of the
diffusion model on supervised data in ill-posed tasks. Secondly, generated by
the same noise schedule, dynamic conditions are used to gradually adjust their
statistical characteristics, naturally embed time-related information, and
reduce the difficulty of network learning. We analyze the learning objectives
of the network under different conditional forms in the single-step denoising
process and compare the changes in its attention weights in the network,
demonstrating the superiority of our dynamic conditions. Taking dehazing and
visible-infrared fusion as typical ill-posed multi-task scenarios, we achieve
the best performance in multiple indicators on public datasets. The code has
been publicly released at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DCDB-D3C2.

state-of-the-art benchmarks of Bangla handwritten character classification show
that the proposed model achieves better accuracy in classifying the data.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法将变化区域检测和变化时刻识别作为独立任务处理，但变化区域可以从变化时刻推断出来，需要确保两者结果的一致性。

Method: 采用三步骤方法：差异提取与增强、粗粒度变化时刻提取、细粒度变化时刻提取与变化区域推断，包括轻量级编码器、边界增强卷积、时空相关性分析和多尺度时间CAM模块。

Result: 提出了一个能够同时指示变化发生位置和时间的一致性变化检测网络框架。

Conclusion: CAIM-Net通过从变化时刻推断变化区域，有效解决了时间序列变化检测中变化区域与变化时刻结果不一致的问题。

Abstract: Time series change detection is a critical task for exploring ecosystem
dynamics using time series remote sensing images, because it can simultaneously
indicate where and when change occur. While deep learning has shown excellent
performance in this domain, it continues to approach change area detection and
change moment identification as distinct tasks. Given that change area can be
inferred from change moment, we propose a time series change detection network,
named CAIM-Net (Change Area Inference from Moment Network), to ensure
consistency between change area and change moment results. CAIM-Net infers
change area from change moment based on the intrinsic relationship between time
series analysis and spatial change detection. The CAIM-Net comprises three key
steps: Difference Extraction and Enhancement, Coarse Change Moment Extraction,
and Fine Change Moment Extraction and Change Area Inference. In the Difference
Extraction and Enhancement, a lightweight encoder with batch dimension stacking
is designed to rapidly extract difference features. Subsequently, boundary
enhancement convolution is applied to amplify these difference features. In the
Coarse Change Moment Extraction, the enhanced difference features from the
first step are used to spatiotemporal correlation analysis, and then two
distinct methods are employed to determine coarse change moments. In the Fine
Change Moment Extraction and Change Area Inference, a multiscale temporal Class
Activation Mapping (CAM) module first increases the weight of the
change-occurring moment from coarse change moments. Then the weighted change
moment is used to infer change area based on the fact that pixels with the
change moment must have undergone a change.

Conclusion: ADA-GAN通过生成对抗网络生成高质量训练数据的方法，有效提升了复杂手写字符分类的性能，为复杂字符识别提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Handwritten characters can be trickier to classify due to their complex and
cursive nature compared to simple and non-cursive characters. We present an
external classifier along with a Generative Adversarial Network that can
classify highly cursive and complex characters. The generator network produces
fake handwritten character images, which are then used to augment the training
data after adding adversarially perturbed noise and achieving a confidence
score above a threshold with the discriminator network. The results show that
the accuracy of convolutional neural networks decreases as character complexity
increases, but our proposed model, ADA-GAN, remains more robust and effective
for both cursive and complex characters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型存在文本-视觉偏差和共现偏差导致的幻觉问题，现有方法缺乏对实例间偏差水平波动的理解，需要一种无需额外资源的方法来同时缓解这两种偏差。

Method: 使用基于梯度的自反思方法估计不同token类型（视觉、提示、先前输出）的影响力，检测物体相关视觉token，并将其整合到影响感知对比解码框架中。

Result: 在LLaVA-QA90上实现了高达92%的准确率提升，有效减少了幻觉现象。

Conclusion: 该方法能够在不依赖额外资源的情况下，有效缓解多模态大语言模型中的文本-视觉偏差和共现偏差，显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Hallucinations in multimodal large language model are caused by the
text-visual bias and the co-occurrence bias. The former reflects an
over-reliance on text information in the decision-making process, while the
latter arises from the statistical object-pairing patterns abstracted from the
training data. Existing mitigation methods heuristically address these biases
without understanding the fluctuating bias level across the instances. We first
propose estimating the influence of respective token types (visual, prompt, and
previous outputs) using a gradient-based self-reflection method. The estimated
token influence further enables the detection of object-related visual tokens
and their integration into an influence-aware contrastive decoding framework to
mitigate both types of biases simultaneously. Our method operates without the
need for additional resources, such as costly fine-tuning, extra models, or
data statistics. Extensive experiments show it effectively reduces

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑内动脉椰检测和建模面临标注3D数据稀缺的挑战，需要引入更有效的几何表征方法

Method: 采用跨领域特征转移方法，将TRELLIS模型在非医疗大规模3D数据上学习的表面特征用于加强神经网络，替代传统点法向量或网格描述符

Result: 在三个下游任务中都获得显著收益：分类准确度和F1分数提升，分割质量改善，模拟误差减少15%

Conclusion: 证明了将通用生成模型的3D表征转移到专业医疗任务的广阔潜力

Abstract: Intracranial aneurysms pose a significant clinical risk yet are difficult to
detect, delineate and model due to limited annotated 3D data. We propose a
cross-domain feature-transfer approach that leverages the latent geometric
embeddings learned by TRELLIS, a generative model trained on large-scale
non-medical 3D datasets, to augment neural networks for aneurysm analysis. By
replacing conventional point normals or mesh descriptors with TRELLIS surface
features, we systematically enhance three downstream tasks: (i) classifying
aneurysms versus healthy vessels in the Intra3D dataset, (ii) segmenting
aneurysm and vessel regions on 3D meshes, and (iii) predicting time-evolving
blood-flow fields using a graph neural network on the AnXplore dataset. Our
experiments show that the inclusion of these features yields strong gains in
accuracy, F1-score and segmentation quality over state-of-the-art baselines,
and reduces simulation error by 15\%. These results illustrate the broader
potential of transferring 3D representations from general-purpose generative
models to specialized medical tasks.

Result: 在公共数据集上的实验表明，该方法对现有欺骗攻击检测系统构成现实威胁。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了人脸反欺骗检测中后门投毒的潜在威胁，需要加强对此类攻击的防御措施。

Abstract: Face recognition systems are robust against environmental changes and noise,
and thus may be vulnerable to illegal authentication attempts using user face
photos, such as spoofing attacks. To prevent such spoofing attacks, it is
crucial to discriminate whether the input image is a live user image or a
spoofed image prior to the face recognition process. Most existing spoofing
attack detection methods utilize deep learning, which necessitates a
substantial amount of training data. Consequently, if malicious data is
injected into a portion of the training dataset, a specific spoofing attack may
be erroneously classified as live, leading to false positives.In this paper, we
propose a novel backdoor poisoning attack method to demonstrate the latent
threat of backdoor poisoning within face anti-spoofing detection. The proposed
method enables certain spoofing attacks to bypass detection by embedding
features extracted from the spoofing attack's face image into a live face image
without inducing any perceptible visual alterations.Through experiments
conducted on public datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method
constitutes a realistic threat to existing spoofing attack detection systems.

Abstract: Poisoning attacks pose an increasing threat to the security and robustness of
Artificial Intelligence systems in the military domain. The widespread use of
open-source datasets and pretrained models exacerbates this risk. Despite the
severity of this threat, there is limited research on the application and
detection of poisoning attacks on object detection systems. This is especially
problematic in the military domain, where attacks can have grave consequences.
In this work, we both investigate the effect of poisoning attacks on military
object detectors in practice, and the best approach to detect these attacks. To
support this research, we create a small, custom dataset featuring military
vehicles: MilCivVeh. We explore the vulnerability of military object detectors
for poisoning attacks by implementing a modified version of the BadDet attack:
a patch-based poisoning attack. We then assess its impact, finding that while a
positive attack success rate is achievable, it requires a substantial portion
of the data to be poisoned -- raising questions about its practical
applicability. To address the detection challenge, we test both specialized
poisoning detection methods and anomaly detection methods from the visual
industrial inspection domain. Since our research shows that both classes of
methods are lacking, we introduce our own patch detection method: AutoDetect, a
simple, fast, and lightweight autoencoder-based method. Our method shows
promising results in separating clean from poisoned samples using the
reconstruction error of image slices, outperforming existing methods, while
being less time- and memory-intensive. We urge that the availability of large,
representative datasets in the military domain is a prerequisite to further
evaluate risks of poisoning attacks and opportunities patch detection.

Abstract: Organoids replicate organ structure and function, playing a crucial role in
fields such as tumor treatment and drug screening. Their shape and size can
indicate their developmental status, but traditional fluorescence labeling
methods risk compromising their structure. Therefore, this paper proposes an
automated, non-destructive approach to organoid segmentation and tracking. We
introduced the LGBP-OrgaNet, a deep learning-based system proficient in
accurately segmenting, tracking, and quantifying organoids. The model leverages
complementary information extracted from CNN and Transformer modules and
introduces the innovative feature fusion module, Learnable Gaussian Band Pass
Fusion, to merge data from two branches. Additionally, in the decoder, the
model proposes a Bidirectional Cross Fusion Block to fuse multi-scale features,
and finally completes the decoding through progressive concatenation and
upsampling. SROrga demonstrates satisfactory segmentation accuracy and
robustness on organoids segmentation datasets, providing a potent tool for

Abstract: Astrocytes are critical glial cells whose altered morphology and density are
hallmarks of many neurological disorders. However, their intricate branching
and stain dependent variability make automated detection of histological images
a highly challenging task. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid CNN
Transformer detector that combines local feature extraction with global
contextual reasoning. A heatmap guided query mechanism generates spatially
grounded anchors for small and faint astrocytes, while a lightweight
Transformer module improves discrimination in dense clusters. Evaluated on
ALDH1L1 and GFAP stained astrocyte datasets, the model consistently
outperformed Faster R-CNN, YOLOv11 and DETR, achieving higher sensitivity with
fewer false positives, as confirmed by FROC analysis. These results highlight
the potential of hybrid CNN Transformer architectures for robust astrocyte
detection and provide a foundation for advanced computational pathology tools.

Motivation: 现有手-物体姿态估计方法存在穿透、接触区域间隙问题，且难以捕捉手部在交互过程中的真实变形。

Method: 将手-物体交互建模为引力场驱动过程，使用基于引力场的扩散桥模拟可变形手部表面与刚性物体的交互，并引入文本语义信息指导引力场构建。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，该方法能有效消除穿透、确保稳定抓握、捕捉真实手部变形，生成物理合理的交互状态。

Conclusion: GravityDB方法通过引力场驱动和语义引导，成功解决了手-物体交互中的关键挑战，为高质量的交互重建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Existing reconstruction or hand-object pose estimation methods are capable of
producing coarse interaction states. However, due to the complex and diverse
geometry of both human hands and objects, these approaches often suffer from
interpenetration or leave noticeable gaps in regions that are supposed to be in
contact. Moreover, the surface of a real human hand undergoes non-negligible
deformations during interaction, which are difficult to capture and represent
with previous methods. To tackle these challenges, we formulate hand-object
interaction as an attraction-driven process and propose a Gravity-Field Based
Diffusion Bridge (GravityDB) to simulate interactions between a deformable hand
surface and rigid objects. Our approach effectively resolves the aforementioned
issues by generating physically plausible interactions that are free of
interpenetration, ensure stable grasping, and capture realistic hand
deformations. Furthermore, we incorporate semantic information from textual
descriptions to guide the construction of the gravitational field, enabling
more semantically meaningful interaction regions. Extensive qualitative and
quantitative experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method.

Conclusion: TinyDrop展示了出色的泛化能力和实际效用，为高效ViT分类提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) achieve strong performance in image classification
but incur high computational costs from processing all image tokens. To reduce
inference costs in large ViTs without compromising accuracy, we propose
TinyDrop, a training-free token dropping framework guided by a lightweight
vision model. The guidance model estimates the importance of tokens while
performing inference, thereby selectively discarding low-importance tokens if
large vit models need to perform attention calculations. The framework operates
plug-and-play, requires no architectural modifications, and is compatible with
diverse ViT architectures. Evaluations on standard image classification
benchmarks demonstrate that our framework reduces FLOPs by up to 80% for ViTs
with minimal accuracy degradation, highlighting its generalization capability
and practical utility for efficient ViT-based classification.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出TADM-3D模型，一种3D时间感知扩散模型，用于准确预测MRI脑部扫描的未来变化，解决了现有方法在时间关系建模、临床实用性和3D上下文利用方面的局限性。


<details>

Motivation: 现有MRI预测方法存在三个主要问题：(1)未能明确捕捉结构变化与时间间隔的关系；(2)仅依赖扫描插值，缺乏临床实用性；(3)大多基于2D切片架构，忽略了完整的3D解剖上下文。需要开发能够准确预测脑部病理进展的3D方法。

Method: 提出TADM-3D模型，使用预训练的脑龄估计器(BAE)指导扩散模型生成准确反映年龄差异的MRI。引入Back-In-Time Regularisation(BITR)技术，通过双向训练(前向和后向)提高时间感知准确性。

Result: 在OASIS-3数据集上训练和评估，并在NACC数据集的外部测试集上验证了泛化性能。模型能够生成更准确的时间感知扫描。

Conclusion: TADM-3D通过结合脑龄估计器和双向正则化，成功解决了现有方法的局限性，为临床提供了一种准确预测脑部病理进展的3D MRI生成工具。

Abstract: Generating realistic MRIs to accurately predict future changes in the
structure of brain is an invaluable tool for clinicians in assessing clinical
outcomes and analysing the disease progression at the patient level. However,
current existing methods present some limitations: (i) some approaches fail to
explicitly capture the relationship between structural changes and time
intervals, especially when trained on age-imbalanced datasets; (ii) others rely
only on scan interpolation, which lack clinical utility, as they generate
intermediate images between timepoints rather than future pathological
progression; and (iii) most approaches rely on 2D slice-based architectures,
thereby disregarding full 3D anatomical context, which is essential for
accurate longitudinal predictions. We propose a 3D Temporally-Aware Diffusion
Model (TADM-3D), which accurately predicts brain progression on MRI volumes. To
better model the relationship between time interval and brain changes, TADM-3D
uses a pre-trained Brain-Age Estimator (BAE) that guides the diffusion model in
the generation of MRIs that accurately reflect the expected age difference
between baseline and generated follow-up scans. Additionally, to further
improve the temporal awareness of TADM-3D, we propose the Back-In-Time
Regularisation (BITR), by training TADM-3D to predict bidirectionally from the
baseline to follow-up (forward), as well as from the follow-up to baseline
(backward). Although predicting past scans has limited clinical applications,
this regularisation helps the model generate temporally more accurate scans. We
train and evaluate TADM-3D on the OASIS-3 dataset, and we validate the
generalisation performance on an external test set from the NACC dataset. The
code will be available upon acceptance.

Motivation: 在生物医学分割任务中，保持细长结构的连续性和长度比体素级精度更重要。现有方法容易因信号丢失导致分割不连续，影响下游应用。

Method: 提出负中心线损失和简化拓扑损失两种新损失函数，结合CNN使用。讨论了实验设计特征如下采样和间距校正来获得连续分割掩码。在3D光片荧光显微镜轴突起始段数据集上评估。

Result: 相比标准CNN和现有拓扑感知损失，新方法显著减少了每个实例的分割不连续性，特别是在输入信号缺失区域，改善了实例长度计算的准确性。

Conclusion: 在损失函数设计中嵌入结构先验可以显著提高生物应用分割的可靠性，结构连续性比体素级精度更重要。

Abstract: In many biomedical segmentation tasks, the preservation of elongated
structure continuity and length is more important than voxel-wise accuracy. We
propose two novel loss functions, Negative Centerline Loss and Simplified
Topology Loss, that, applied to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), help
preserve connectivity of output instances. Moreover, we discuss characteristics
of experiment design, such as downscaling and spacing correction, that help
obtain continuous segmentation masks. We evaluate our approach on a 3D
light-sheet fluorescence microscopy dataset of axon initial segments (AIS), a
task prone to discontinuity due to signal dropout. Compared to standard CNNs
and existing topology-aware losses, our methods reduce the number of
segmentation discontinuities per instance, particularly in regions with missing
input signal, resulting in improved instance length calculation in downstream
applications. Our findings demonstrate that structural priors embedded in the
loss design can significantly enhance the reliability of segmentation for
biological applications.

Abstract: Next-generation AI companions must go beyond general video understanding to
resolve spatial and temporal references in dynamic, real-world environments.
Existing Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs), while capable of
coarse-level comprehension, struggle with fine-grained, spatiotemporal
reasoning, especially when user queries rely on time-based event references for
temporal anchoring, or gestural cues for spatial anchoring to clarify object
references and positions. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce Strefer, a
synthetic instruction data generation framework designed to equip Video LLMs
with spatiotemporal referring and reasoning capabilities. Strefer produces
diverse instruction-tuning data using a data engine that pseudo-annotates
temporally dense, fine-grained video metadata, capturing rich spatial and
temporal information in a structured manner, including subjects, objects, their
locations as masklets, and their action descriptions and timelines. Our
approach enhances the ability of Video LLMs to interpret spatial and temporal
references, fostering more versatile, space-time-aware reasoning essential for
real-world AI companions. Without using proprietary models, costly human
annotation, or the need to annotate large volumes of new videos, experimental
evaluations show that models trained with data produced by Strefer outperform
baselines on tasks requiring spatial and temporal disambiguation. Additionally,
these models exhibit enhanced space-time-aware reasoning, establishing a new
foundation for perceptually grounded, instruction-tuned Video LLMs.

Conclusion: Count2Density能够有效从计数级标注中提取空间信息，实现准确的子区域计数，为减少标注负担提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Crowd density estimation is a well-known computer vision task aimed at
estimating the density distribution of people in an image. The main challenge
in this domain is the reliance on fine-grained location-level annotations,
(i.e. points placed on top of each individual) to train deep networks.
Collecting such detailed annotations is both tedious, time-consuming, and poses
a significant barrier to scalability for real-world applications. To alleviate
this burden, we present Count2Density: a novel pipeline designed to predict
meaningful density maps containing quantitative spatial information using only
count-level annotations (i.e., total number of people) during training. To
achieve this, Count2Density generates pseudo-density maps leveraging past
predictions stored in a Historical Map Bank, thereby reducing confirmation
bias. This bank is initialised using an unsupervised saliency estimator to
provide an initial spatial prior and is iteratively updated with an EMA of
predicted density maps. These pseudo-density maps are obtained by sampling
locations from estimated crowd areas using a hypergeometric distribution, with
the number of samplings determined by the count-level annotations. To further
enhance the spatial awareness of the model, we add a self-supervised
contrastive spatial regulariser to encourage similar feature representations
within crowded regions while maximising dissimilarity with background regions.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms
cross-domain adaptation methods and achieves better results than recent
state-of-the-art approaches in semi-supervised settings across several
datasets. Additional analyses validate the effectiveness of each individual
component of our pipeline, confirming the ability of Count2Density to
effectively retrieve spatial information from count-level annotations and
enabling accurate subregion counting.

Conclusion: 该方法为低强度CT成像提供了更安全和准确的解决方案，通过强化学习动态优化去噪策略，显著提升了图像质量和诊断性能

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) is critical for minimizing radiation
exposure, but it often leads to increased noise and reduced image quality.
Traditional denoising methods, such as iterative optimization or supervised
learning, often fail to preserve image quality. To address these challenges, we
introduce PPORLD-EDNetLDCT, a reinforcement learning-based (RL) approach with
Encoder-Decoder for LDCT. Our method utilizes a dynamic RL-based approach in
which an advanced posterior policy optimization (PPO) algorithm is used to
optimize denoising policies in real time, based on image quality feedback,
trained via a custom gym environment. The experimental results on the low dose
CT image and projection dataset demonstrate that the proposed PPORLD-EDNetLDCT
model outperforms traditional denoising techniques and other DL-based methods,
achieving a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 41.87, a structural similarity index
measure of 0.9814 and a root mean squared error of 0.00236. Moreover, in
NIH-AAPM-Mayo Clinic Low Dose CT Challenge dataset our method achived a PSNR of
41.52, SSIM of 0.9723 and RMSE of 0.0051. Furthermore, we validated the quality
of denoising using a classification task in the COVID-19 LDCT dataset, where
the images processed by our method improved the classification accuracy to
94\%, achieving 4\% higher accuracy compared to denoising without RL-based
denoising. This method offers a promising solution for safer and more accurate
LDCT imaging.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved

transformer and supervised contrastive learning to provide emotional cues.
Additionally, we develop an emotion-aware prompt engineering strategy for
generating empathetic responses and integrate a Text-to-Speech (TTS) system and
animated avatar module for expressive interactions. \ours provides a framework

Result: 在ADHD-200和ABIDE基准测试中超越现有方法，在敏感性、特异性和ROC曲线下面积方面取得显著提升

Conclusion: RTGMFF通过统一文本生成和多模态特征融合，有效提升了脑疾病诊断的准确性和可靠性

Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a powerful tool for probing
brain function, yet reliable clinical diagnosis is hampered by low
signal-to-noise ratios, inter-subject variability, and the limited frequency
awareness of prevailing CNN- and Transformer-based models. Moreover, most fMRI
datasets lack textual annotations that could contextualize regional activation
and connectivity patterns. We introduce RTGMFF, a framework that unifies
automatic ROI-level text generation with multimodal feature fusion for
brain-disorder diagnosis. RTGMFF consists of three components: (i) ROI-driven
fMRI text generation deterministically condenses each subject's activation,
connectivity, age, and sex into reproducible text tokens; (ii) Hybrid
frequency-spatial encoder fuses a hierarchical wavelet-mamba branch with a
cross-scale Transformer encoder to capture frequency-domain structure alongside
long-range spatial dependencies; and (iii) Adaptive semantic alignment module
embeds the ROI token sequence and visual features in a shared space, using a
regularized cosine-similarity loss to narrow the modality gap. Extensive
experiments on the ADHD-200 and ABIDE benchmarks show that RTGMFF surpasses
current methods in diagnostic accuracy, achieving notable gains in sensitivity,
specificity, and area under the ROC curve. Code is available at

Abstract: We present PI3DETR, an end-to-end framework that directly predicts 3D
parametric curve instances from raw point clouds, avoiding the intermediate
representations and multi-stage processing common in prior work. Extending
3DETR, our model introduces a geometry-aware matching strategy and specialized

dataset and generalizes effectively to real sensor data, offering a simple yet
powerful solution for 3D edge and curve estimation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SynBT：基于3D扩散模型的乳腺肿瘤合成方法，通过patch-to-volume自编码器和掩码条件扩散模型生成高质量乳腺MRI肿瘤图像，提升分割性能2-3% Dice分数


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有肿瘤合成方法在大空间体积（如乳腺MRI大视野）中表现不佳，常用基于小patch的生成方法无法满足大FOV需求

Method: 使用patch-to-volume自编码器压缩高分辨率MRI到紧凑潜在空间，保持大FOV体积分辨率；采用掩码条件扩散模型在选定乳腺组织区域合成肿瘤

Result: 在大型公共数据集上，该方法使常见分割模型的性能提升2-3% Dice分数

Conclusion: SynBT能够生成高质量的乳腺肿瘤合成图像，为MRI图像中的肿瘤分割任务提供有益支持

Abstract: Synthetic tumors in medical images offer controllable characteristics that
facilitate the training of machine learning models, leading to an improved
segmentation performance. However, the existing methods of tumor synthesis
yield suboptimal performances when tumor occupies a large spatial volume, such
as breast tumor segmentation in MRI with a large field-of-view (FOV), while
commonly used tumor generation methods are based on small patches. In this
paper, we propose a 3D medical diffusion model, called SynBT, to generate
high-quality breast tumor (BT) in contrast-enhanced MRI images. The proposed
model consists of a patch-to-volume autoencoder, which is able to compress the
high-resolution MRIs into compact latent space, while preserving the resolution
of volumes with large FOV. Using the obtained latent space feature vector, a
mask-conditioned diffusion model is used to synthesize breast tumors within
selected regions of breast tissue, resulting in realistic tumor appearances. We
evaluated the proposed method for a tumor segmentation task, which demonstrated
the proposed high-quality tumor synthesis method can facilitate the common
segmentation models with performance improvement of 2-3% Dice Score on a large
public dataset, and therefore provides benefits for tumor segmentation in MRI
images.

Motivation: 将CLIP模型在2D图像上的强大异常检测能力扩展到3D领域，应对未见对象的多样化类别语义异常检测挑战

Method: 分为PointAD（隐式3D表征）和PointAD+（显式3D表征）两个阶段：
1. 利用点-像素对应关系通过渲染像素识别3D异常
2. 通过G-aggregation涵盖几何空间信息
3. 层次表征学习，结合渲染提示和几何提示
4. 跨层次对比对齐促进层间交互

Conclusion: 该框架成功将2D视觉知知识扩展到3D领域，通过结合渲染和空间异常信息，实现了高效的零样本学习3D异常检测，为3D异常检测提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to transfer CLIP's robust 2D generalization
capabilities to identify 3D anomalies across unseen objects of highly diverse
class semantics. To this end, we propose a unified framework to comprehensively
detect and segment 3D anomalies by leveraging both point- and pixel-level
information. We first design PointAD, which leverages point-pixel
correspondence to represent 3D anomalies through their associated rendering
pixel representations. This approach is referred to as implicit 3D
representation, as it focuses solely on rendering pixel anomalies but neglects
the inherent spatial relationships within point clouds. Then, we propose
PointAD+ to further broaden the interpretation of 3D anomalies by introducing
explicit 3D representation, emphasizing spatial abnormality to uncover abnormal
spatial relationships. Hence, we propose G-aggregation to involve geometry
information to enable the aggregated point representations spatially aware. To
simultaneously capture rendering and spatial abnormality, PointAD+ proposes
hierarchical representation learning, incorporating implicit and explicit
anomaly semantics into hierarchical text prompts: rendering prompts for the
rendering layer and geometry prompts for the geometry layer. A cross-hierarchy
contrastive alignment is further introduced to promote the interaction between
the rendering and geometry layers, facilitating mutual anomaly learning.
Finally, PointAD+ integrates anomaly semantics from both layers to capture the
generalized anomaly semantics. During the test, PointAD+ can integrate RGB
information in a plug-and-play manner and further improve its detection
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of PointAD+ in
ZS 3D anomaly detection across unseen objects with highly diverse class
semantics, achieving a holistic understanding of abnormality.

TL;DR: 长链式思维数据对轻量级多模态语言模型的推理能力提升至关重要，先进行监督微调再结合强化学习可获得最佳性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索验证奖励强化学习在参数量少于70亿的轻量级多模态语言模型中的有效性，以及长链式思维数据对提升这类模型推理能力的作用

Method: 使用长链式思维数据进行监督微调(SFT)，随后进行强化学习(RL)阶段来进一步提升模型性能

Result: 长链式思维数据的SFT显著提升了MLLM的推理能力，且在SFT后通过RL阶段可获得额外的性能增益

Conclusion: 使用长链式思维数据的SFT阶段是开发轻量级多模态语言模型推理能力的关键前提条件

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards has enhanced the
reasoning of large-scale language models (LLMs), its efficacy for lightweight
multimodal language models (MLLMs) with fewer than seven billion parameters
remains underexplored. This paper investigates the role of long
Chain-of-Thought (long CoT) data in enhancing the reasoning abilities of such
MLLMs. Our findings demonstrate that Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with long CoT
data significantly improves MLLM reasoning. Furthermore, we observe that after
this initial SFT phase, MLLMs can achieve additional performance gains through
a subsequent RL stage. We conclude that a SFT stage with long CoT data is a
critical prerequisite for developing the reasoning capabilities of lightweight
MLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfraDiffusion是一个零样本框架，通过虚拟相机将砖石点云转换为深度图，并使用DDNM进行恢复，无需特定任务训练即可提升深度图的视觉清晰度和几何一致性，显著改善了砖级分割效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在低光照环境（如砖石隧道）中获取高分辨率图像不切实际，而点云虽然对昏暗光照具有鲁棒性，但通常是非结构化、稀疏且有噪声的，限制了细粒度分割。

Method: 提出InfraDiffusion框架：1）使用虚拟相机将砖石点云投影为深度图；2）采用Denoising Diffusion Null-space Model (DDNM)进行恢复；3）结合Segment Anything Model (SAM)进行砖级分割。

Result: 在砖石桥梁和隧道点云数据集上的实验表明，该方法在砖级分割方面取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: InfraDiffusion展示了在砖石资产自动化检测方面的潜力，为低光照环境下的基础设施监测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Point clouds are widely used for infrastructure monitoring by providing
geometric information, where segmentation is required for downstream tasks such
as defect detection. Existing research has automated semantic segmentation of
structural components, while brick-level segmentation (identifying defects such
as spalling and mortar loss) has been primarily conducted from RGB images.
However, acquiring high-resolution images is impractical in low-light
environments like masonry tunnels. Point clouds, though robust to dim lighting,
are typically unstructured, sparse, and noisy, limiting fine-grained
segmentation. We present InfraDiffusion, a zero-shot framework that projects
masonry point clouds into depth maps using virtual cameras and restores them by
adapting the Denoising Diffusion Null-space Model (DDNM). Without task-specific
training, InfraDiffusion enhances visual clarity and geometric consistency of
depth maps. Experiments on masonry bridge and tunnel point cloud datasets show
significant improvements in brick-level segmentation using the Segment Anything
Model (SAM), underscoring its potential for automated inspection of masonry
assets. Our code and data is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法难以同时表征全局依赖和局部一致性，无法兼顾长程交互和边界细节

Method: 使用Transformer捕捉全局依赖，引入内容自适应图神经网络增强局部关系，集成多传播阶数动态学习图结构，采用图残差机制保持全局信息

Result: 实验结果表明优于最先进方法

Conclusion: T-CAGU框架有效解决了高光谱解混中全局和局部特征同时建模的挑战

Abstract: Hyperspectral unmixing (HU) targets to decompose each mixed pixel in remote
sensing images into a set of endmembers and their corresponding abundances.
Despite significant progress in this field using deep learning, most methods
fail to simultaneously characterize global dependencies and local consistency,
making it difficult to preserve both long-range interactions and boundary
details. This letter proposes a novel transformer-guided content-adaptive graph
unmixing framework (T-CAGU), which overcomes these challenges by employing a
transformer to capture global dependencies and introducing a content-adaptive
graph neural network to enhance local relationships. Unlike previous work,
T-CAGU integrates multiple propagation orders to dynamically learn the graph
structure, ensuring robustness against noise. Furthermore, T-CAGU leverages a
graph residual mechanism to preserve global information and stabilize training.
Experimental results demonstrate its superiority over the state-of-the-art
methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/T-CAGU.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估指标对概念定制任务要么过于狭窄要么过于泛化，与人类偏好存在偏差，特别是在多概念评估中难以准确评估概念间交互

Method: 提出分解式GPT评分(D-GPTScore)，将评估标准分解为更细粒度的方面，并使用多模态大语言模型进行方面级评估；同时发布包含单概念和多概念任务的人类偏好对齐概念定制基准(CC-AlignBench)

Result: 该方法在基准测试中显著优于现有方法，与人类偏好表现出更高的相关性

Conclusion: 这项工作为概念定制评估建立了新标准，并突出了未来研究的关键挑战

Abstract: Evaluating concept customization is challenging, as it requires a
comprehensive assessment of fidelity to generative prompts and concept images.
Moreover, evaluating multiple concepts is considerably more difficult than
evaluating a single concept, as it demands detailed assessment not only for
each individual concept but also for the interactions among concepts. While
humans can intuitively assess generated images, existing metrics often provide
either overly narrow or overly generalized evaluations, resulting in
misalignment with human preference. To address this, we propose Decomposed GPT
Score (D-GPTScore), a novel human-aligned evaluation method that decomposes
evaluation criteria into finer aspects and incorporates aspect-wise assessments
using Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). Additionally, we release Human
Preference-Aligned Concept Customization Benchmark (CC-AlignBench), a benchmark
dataset containing both single- and multi-concept tasks, enabling stage-wise
evaluation across a wide difficulty range -- from individual actions to
multi-person interactions. Our method significantly outperforms existing
approaches on this benchmark, exhibiting higher correlation with human
preferences. This work establishes a new standard for evaluating concept
customization and highlights key challenges for future research. The benchmark

Method: 提出了一种可扩展的松耦合多模态框架，能够无缝整合CNV、临床记录和组织病理图像。引入了全港片图像(WSI)的双重表征方法，结合传统图像基础和图象基础表征。还提出了新的多模态融合策略。

Result: 结果显示，将双重WSI表征与CNV和临床健康记录结合，以及使用提出的流水线和融合策略，在乳腺癌分型任务上超过了最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅在乳腺癌分型中表现优异，还具有良好的扩展性，能够轻松整合额外模态并适用于其他癌症类型，而无需重新训练现有模态。

Abstract: Healthcare applications are inherently multimodal, benefiting greatly from
the integration of diverse data sources. However, the modalities available in
clinical settings can vary across different locations and patients. A key area
that stands to gain from multimodal integration is breast cancer molecular
subtyping, an important clinical task that can facilitate personalized
treatment and improve patient prognosis. In this work, we propose a scalable
and loosely-coupled multimodal framework that seamlessly integrates data from
various modalities, including copy number variation (CNV), clinical records,
and histopathology images, to enhance breast cancer subtyping. While our
primary focus is on breast cancer, our framework is designed to easily
accommodate additional modalities, offering the flexibility to scale up or down
with minimal overhead without requiring re-training of existing modalities,
making it applicable to other types of cancers as well. We introduce a
dual-based representation for whole slide images (WSIs), combining traditional
image-based and graph-based WSI representations. This novel dual approach
results in significant performance improvements. Moreover, we present a new
multimodal fusion strategy, demonstrating its ability to enhance performance
across a range of multimodal conditions. Our comprehensive results show that
integrating our dual-based WSI representation with CNV and clinical health
records, along with our pipeline and fusion strategy, outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in breast cancer subtyping.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的密集视频描述方法在处理长视频时遇到计算复杂度和内存限制问题，且需要整个视频作为输入，无法进行在线处理。

Method: 提出带有传输状态的状态空间模型(SSMs)，结合SSMs的长序列和递归特性，解决SSMs在很长上下文中无法持续保持状态的主要限制。

Result: 方法适合在线或流式处理视频，无需等待整个视频处理完成，在密集视频描述中表现良好，使用计算量减少7倍。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了长视频处理的计算挑战，实现了高效的在线密集视频描述，具有强烈的实践价值。

Abstract: Dense video captioning is a challenging video understanding task which aims
to simultaneously segment the video into a sequence of meaningful consecutive
events and to generate detailed captions to accurately describe each event.
Existing methods often encounter difficulties when working with the long videos
associated with dense video captioning, due to the computational complexity and
memory limitations. Furthermore, traditional approaches require the entire
video as input, in order to produce an answer, which precludes online
processing of the video. We address these challenges by time-scaling
State-Space Models (SSMs) to even longer sequences than before. Our approach,
State-Space Models with Transfer State, combines both the long-sequence and
recurrent properties of SSMs and addresses the main limitation of SSMs which
are otherwise not able to sustain their state for very long contexts,
effectively scaling SSMs further in time. The proposed model is particularly
suitable for generating captions on-the-fly, in an online or streaming manner,
without having to wait for the full video to be processed, which is more
beneficial in practice. When applied to dense video captioning, our approach
scales well with video lengths and uses 7x fewer FLOPs.

Motivation: 从低信噪比的EEG信号中解码视觉神经表征是一个挑战，需要增强EEG信号与视觉内容的语义对应关系。

Method: 引入文本模态提供显式语义标签；提出适配器模块利用预训练视觉和文本表示；设计模态一致性动态平衡策略调整各模态贡献权重；使用随机扰动正则化增强泛化能力。

Result: 在ThingsEEG数据集上，Top-1和Top-5准确率分别比之前最优方法提高了2.0%和4.7%。

Conclusion: 该多模态融合框架通过文本增强语义对齐、动态平衡模态贡献和正则化扰动，有效提升了从EEG信号解码视觉神经表征的性能。

Abstract: In this work, we propose an innovative framework that integrates EEG, image,
and text data, aiming to decode visual neural representations from low
signal-to-noise ratio EEG signals. Specifically, we introduce text modality to
enhance the semantic correspondence between EEG signals and visual content.
With the explicit semantic labels provided by text, image and EEG features of
the same category can be more closely aligned with the corresponding text
representations in a shared multimodal space. To fully utilize pre-trained
visual and textual representations, we propose an adapter module that
alleviates the instability of high-dimensional representation while
facilitating the alignment and fusion of cross-modal features. Additionally, to
alleviate the imbalance in multimodal feature contributions introduced by the
textual representations, we propose a Modal Consistency Dynamic Balance (MCDB)
strategy that dynamically adjusts the contribution weights of each modality. We
further propose a stochastic perturbation regularization (SPR) term to enhance
the generalization ability of semantic perturbation-based models by introducing
dynamic Gaussian noise in the modality optimization process. The evaluation
results on the ThingsEEG dataset show that our method surpasses previous
state-of-the-art methods in both Top-1 and Top-5 accuracy metrics, improving by
2.0\% and 4.7\% respectively.

Motivation: 针对道路缺陷检测器通常部署在内存和计算资源有限的边缘设备上的实际场景，需要开发不使用集成方法或测试时增强的高效检测方法。

Method: 提出JTGD方法，联合训练图像生成器和检测器。设计双判别器确保合成缺陷补丁和整体图像的真实性，使用CLIP-based Fréchet Inception Distance损失提高合成图像质量，通过联合训练使生成器合成对检测器更具挑战性的样本。

Conclusion: JTGD方法通过联合训练生成器和检测器，在不使用集成和TTA的情况下实现了优异的道路缺陷检测性能，同时大幅减少了模型参数量，非常适合在实际边缘设备上部署。

Abstract: Road defect detection is important for road authorities to reduce the vehicle
damage caused by road defects. Considering the practical scenarios where the
defect detectors are typically deployed on edge devices with limited memory and
computational resource, we aim at performing road defect detection without
using ensemble-based methods or test-time augmentation (TTA). To this end, we
propose to Jointly Train the image Generator and Detector for road defect
detection (dubbed as JTGD). We design the dual discriminators for the
generative model to enforce both the synthesized defect patches and overall
images to look plausible. The synthesized image quality is improved by our
proposed CLIP-based Fr\'echet Inception Distance loss. The generative model in
JTGD is trained jointly with the detector to encourage the generative model to
synthesize harder examples for the detector. Since harder synthesized images of
better quality caused by the aforesaid design are used in the data
augmentation, JTGD outperforms the state-of-the-art method in the RDD2022 road
defect detection benchmark across various countries under the condition of no
ensemble and TTA. JTGD only uses less than 20% of the number of parameters
compared with the competing baseline, which makes it more suitable for
deployment on edge devices in practice.

Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型在低级视觉任务(如图像质量评估)上的高效适配问题，避免全量微调的高计算成本。

Method: 训练像素空间视觉提示，通过加法与输入图像结合，使用mPLUG-Owl2模型进行处理，只需训练少量参数(最多600K)。

Result: 在KADID-10k、KonIQ-10k和AGIQA-3k数据集上进行评测，在合成、实际和AI生成图像夺真类型上都表现竞争力，在KADID-10k上达到0.93 SRCC。

Conclusion: 这是首个使用像素空间视觉提示的NR-IQA方法，证明了MLLM在低级视觉任务上的高效适配能力，为质量评估领域提供了一种参数效率高的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel parameter-efficient adaptation method for
No- Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) using visual prompts optimized
in pixel-space. Unlike full fine-tuning of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), our approach trains only 600K parameters at most (< 0.01% of the base
model), while keeping the underlying model fully frozen. During inference,
these visual prompts are combined with images via addition and processed by
mPLUG-Owl2 with the textual query "Rate the technical quality of the image."
Evaluations across distortion types (synthetic, realistic, AI-generated) on
KADID- 10k, KonIQ-10k, and AGIQA-3k demonstrate competitive performance against
full finetuned methods and specialized NR-IQA models, achieving 0.93 SRCC on
KADID-10k. To our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage pixel-space

Abstract: We introduce OneCAT, a unified multimodal model that seamlessly integrates
understanding, generation, and editing within a novel, pure decoder-only
transformer architecture. Our framework uniquely eliminates the need for
external components such as Vision Transformers (ViT) or vision tokenizer
during inference, leading to significant efficiency gains, especially for
high-resolution inputs. This is achieved through a modality-specific
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure trained with a single autoregressive (AR)
objective, which also natively supports dynamic resolutions. Furthermore, we
pioneer a multi-scale visual autoregressive mechanism within the Large Language
Model (LLM) that drastically reduces decoding steps compared to diffusion-based
methods while maintaining state-of-the-art performance. Our findings
demonstrate the powerful potential of pure autoregressive modeling as a
sufficient and elegant foundation for unified multimodal intelligence. As a
result, OneCAT sets a new performance standard, outperforming existing
open-source unified multimodal models across benchmarks for multimodal
generation, editing, and understanding.

Conclusion: 该研究为海洋深海视频分析领域提供了重要的标准化评测工具，有助于推动相关模型的发展和性能优化

Abstract: Benchmarking multi-object tracking and object detection model performance is
an essential step in machine learning model development, as it allows
researchers to evaluate model detection and tracker performance on
human-generated 'test' data, facilitating consistent comparisons between models
and trackers and aiding performance optimization. In this study, a novel
benchmark video dataset was developed and used to assess the performance of
several Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute object detection models and a
FathomNet single-class object detection model together with several trackers.
The dataset consists of four video sequences representing midwater and benthic
deep-sea habitats. Performance was evaluated using Higher Order Tracking
Accuracy, a metric that balances detection, localization, and association
accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first publicly available
benchmark for multi-object tracking in deep-sea video footage. We provide the
benchmark data, a clearly documented workflow for generating additional
benchmark videos, as well as example Python notebooks for computing metrics.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个用于研究笔迹遗传影响的综合数据库，包含210个家庭的手写样本，分析家庭成员笔迹特征的相似性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏研究笔迹遗传性的数据库，需要创建能够回答笔迹是否具有遗传成分、家庭关系是否影响笔迹等问题的数据集

Method: 收集210个家庭（包括祖父母、父母、叔伯姑姨、兄弟姐妹、堂表兄弟姐妹、侄子侄女等）的手写样本，包括数字、字母、形状和自由段落，使用专门设计的表格记录家庭关系

Result: 通过比较家庭成员笔迹特征，检测到他们之间的书写风格和特征相似性，创建了首个此类数据库

Conclusion: 该数据库免费提供给模式识别社区，将为研究遗传和家庭关系对笔迹的影响开辟道路

Abstract: This paper introduces a comprehensive database for research and investigation
on the effects of inheritance on handwriting. A database has been created that
can be used to answer questions such as: Is there a genetic component to
handwriting? Is handwriting inherited? Do family relationships affect
handwriting? Varieties of samples of handwritten components such as: digits,
letters, shapes and free paragraphs of 210 families including (grandparents,
parents, uncles, aunts, siblings, cousins, nephews and nieces) have been
collected using specially designed forms, and family relationships of all
writers are captured. To the best of our knowledge, no such database is
presently available. Based on comparisons and investigation of features of
handwritings of family members, similarities among their features and writing
styles are detected. Our database is freely available to the pattern
recognition community and hope it will pave the way for investigations on the
effects of inheritance and family relationships on handwritings.

TL;DR: T2I-CoReBench是一个全面的文本到图像生成基准测试，评估模型的组合和推理能力，包含1080个复杂提示和13500个检查问题，发现现有模型在复杂场景中表现有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像生成基准测试在评估组合和推理能力方面存在局限性，无法全面评估模型在复杂场景和高密度推理任务中的表现。

Method: 构建一个12维评估分类法，围绕场景图元素（实例、属性、关系）和哲学推理框架（演绎、归纳、溯因）来结构化评估，创建高组合密度和多步推理的复杂提示。

Result: 对27个当前T2I模型的实验表明，它们在复杂高密度场景中的组合能力仍然有限，推理能力更是严重瓶颈，所有模型都难以从提示中推断隐含元素。

Conclusion: T2I-CoReBench提供了一个全面复杂的基准测试，揭示了当前T2I模型在组合和推理能力方面的显著不足，特别是在处理复杂场景和隐含推理方面需要进一步改进。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation aims to synthesize images from textual
prompts, which jointly specify what must be shown and imply what can be
inferred, thereby corresponding to two core capabilities: composition and
reasoning. However, with the emerging advances of T2I models in reasoning
beyond composition, existing benchmarks reveal clear limitations in providing
comprehensive evaluations across and within these capabilities. Meanwhile,
these advances also enable models to handle more complex prompts, whereas
current benchmarks remain limited to low scene density and simplified
one-to-one reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose T2I-CoReBench, a
comprehensive and complex benchmark that evaluates both composition and
reasoning capabilities of T2I models. To ensure comprehensiveness, we structure
composition around scene graph elements (instance, attribute, and relation) and
reasoning around the philosophical framework of inference (deductive,
inductive, and abductive), formulating a 12-dimensional evaluation taxonomy. To
increase complexity, driven by the inherent complexities of real-world
scenarios, we curate each prompt with high compositional density for
composition and multi-step inference for reasoning. We also pair each prompt
with a checklist that specifies individual yes/no questions to assess each
intended element independently to facilitate fine-grained and reliable
evaluation. In statistics, our benchmark comprises 1,080 challenging prompts
and around 13,500 checklist questions. Experiments across 27 current T2I models
reveal that their composition capability still remains limited in complex
high-density scenarios, while the reasoning capability lags even further behind
as a critical bottleneck, with all models struggling to infer implicit elements
from prompts. Our project page: https://t2i-corebench.github.io/.

TL;DR: DrDiff是一个新颖的长文本生成框架，通过动态专家调度、分层稀疏注意力和软吸收引导优化三项核心技术，解决了效率与质量的权衡问题，在多个基准测试中优于现有SOTA方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长文本生成中效率与质量之间的权衡问题，传统方法在处理不同难度和长度的文本时存在计算效率低下的挑战。

Method: 1. 动态专家调度机制：根据文本复杂度智能分配计算资源；2. 分层稀疏注意力机制：将计算复杂度从O(n²)降至O(n)；3. 软吸收引导优化策略：结合DPM-solver++减少扩散步骤。

Result: 在多个长文本生成基准测试中，DrDiff展现出优于现有最先进方法的性能，证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: DrDiff通过三项创新技术成功解决了长文本生成的效率-质量权衡问题，为高效高质量的长文本生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces DrDiff, a novel framework for long-text generation that
overcomes the efficiency-quality trade-off through three core technologies.
First, we design a dynamic expert scheduling mechanism that intelligently
allocates computational resources during the diffusion process based on text
complexity, enabling more efficient handling of text generation tasks of
varying difficulty. Second, we introduce a Hierarchical Sparse Attention (HSA)
mechanism that adaptively adjusts attention patterns according to a variety of
input lengths, reducing computational complexity from O($n^2$) to O($n$) while
maintaining model performance. Finally, we propose a soft absorption guidance
optimization strategy that combines with DPM-solver++ to reduce diffusion
steps, significantly improving generation speed. Comprehensive experiments on
various long-text generation benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our
DrDiff over the existing SOTA methods.

*Pu Wang,Shinji Watanabe,Hugo Van hamme*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文综述了参数高效微调(PEFT)方法在语音识别任务中的综合性能分析，包括引入新的结构化SVD导向(SSVD)微调方法，并在ESPnet框架中实现了全部方法的对比评测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然低秩适配(LoRA)在语音应用中广泛使用，但最新的PEFT变体(如VeRA、DoRA、PiSSA、SVFT)主要为语言和视觉任务开发，在语音领域缺乏充分验证。需要综合性能分析来填补这一空白。

Method: 在ESPnet中集成和测试各种PEFT方法，并提出结构化SVD导向(SSVD)微调方法。SSVD通过选择性旋转输入相关的右奇异向量，保持输出相关向量固定，以维护语义映射。

Result: 在领域偏移语音识别任务(包括儿童语音和方言变体)上进行评估，模型规模从0.1B到2B。SSVD方法能够以最少的可训练参数实现健壮的领域适配，并提高效率。

Conclusion: 该研究完整集成了各种PEFT方法在语音识别中的应用，并提出了效果更好的SSVD方法。所有实现已在ESPnet中开源发布，支持可复现性和未来研究。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a scalable solution for
adapting large foundation models. While low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is widely
used in speech applications, its state-of-the-art variants, e.g., VeRA, DoRA,
PiSSA, and SVFT, are developed mainly for language and vision tasks, with
limited validation in speech. This work presents the first comprehensive
integration and benchmarking of these PEFT methods within ESPnet. We further
introduce structured SVD-guided (SSVD) fine-tuning, which selectively rotates
input-associated right singular vectors while keeping output-associated vectors
fixed to preserve semantic mappings. This design enables robust domain
adaptation with minimal trainable parameters and improved efficiency. We
evaluate all methods on domain-shifted speech recognition tasks, including
child speech and dialectal variation, across model scales from 0.1B to 2B. All
implementations are released in ESPnet to support reproducibility and future
work.

Motivation: 探究大型语言模型在生成文本时如何构建关于不同种族女性的叙事，特别是揭示看似语法连贯、表面中立的文本背后可能存在的殖民结构性偏见

Method: 从2100个生成文本中应用计算方法进行语义相似性分组，结合机器学习技术与人工定性话语分析的综合方法

Result: 识别出三种主要话语表征：社会克服、祖先神话化和主观自我实现，发现文本材料化了殖民结构化的女性身体框架

Conclusion: 研究表明LLM生成的文本可能强化历史不平等，需要结合计算方法和定性分析来揭示语言模型中的结构性偏见

Abstract: This study investigates how large language models, in particular LLaMA
3.2-3B, construct narratives about Black and white women in short stories
generated in Portuguese. From 2100 texts, we applied computational methods to
group semantically similar stories, allowing a selection for qualitative
analysis. Three main discursive representations emerge: social overcoming,
ancestral mythification and subjective self-realization. The analysis uncovers
how grammatically coherent, seemingly neutral texts materialize a crystallized,
colonially structured framing of the female body, reinforcing historical
inequalities. The study proposes an integrated approach, that combines machine
learning techniques with qualitative, manual discourse analysis.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了IDEAlgin框架，通过"三选一"任务评估LLM生成解释性标注与专家标注的相似性，发现基于向量的方法效果不佳，而LLM作为评判者能显著提升与专家判断的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM在开放式解释性标注任务（如主题分析、学生作业反馈）中与专家标注的相似性缺乏有效的可扩展方法，需要开发可靠的评估范式。

Method: 提出IDEAlgin基准框架，使用"三选一"三元组判断任务收集专家相似性评分，并比较各种相似性度量方法（基于向量的方法和LLM作为评判者）与人类基准的一致性。

Result: 基于向量的度量方法无法捕捉专家关注的细微相似性维度，而通过IDEAlgin提示的LLM相比传统词汇和向量方法，与专家判断的一致性提高了9-30%。

Conclusion: IDEAlgin为大规模评估LLM在开放式专家标注任务中的表现提供了有前景的范式，有助于在教育等领域负责任地部署LLM。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to open-ended,
interpretive annotation tasks, such as thematic analysis by researchers or
generating feedback on student work by teachers. These tasks involve free-text
annotations requiring expert-level judgments grounded in specific objectives
(e.g., research questions or instructional goals). Evaluating whether
LLM-generated annotations align with those generated by expert humans is
challenging to do at scale, and currently, no validated, scalable measure of
similarity in ideas exists. In this paper, we (i) introduce the scalable
evaluation of interpretive annotation by LLMs as a critical and understudied
task, (ii) propose IDEAlgin, an intuitive benchmarking paradigm for capturing
expert similarity ratings via a "pick-the-odd-one-out" triplet judgment task,
and (iii) evaluate various similarity metrics, including vector-based ones
(topic models, embeddings) and LLM-as-a-judge via IDEAlgin, against these human
benchmarks. Applying this approach to two real-world educational datasets
(interpretive analysis and feedback generation), we find that vector-based
metrics largely fail to capture the nuanced dimensions of similarity meaningful
to experts. Prompting LLMs via IDEAlgin significantly improves alignment with
expert judgments (9-30% increase) compared to traditional lexical and
vector-based metrics. These results establish IDEAlgin as a promising paradigm
for evaluating LLMs against open-ended expert annotations at scale, informing
responsible deployment of LLMs in education and beyond.

Method: 使用问题生成器、评估器和答案生成器群组成的循环流程，通过质量评估和低信心度输出触发自动重新生成和模型更新，实现持续学习和迭代精炼。

Result: 系统显著超越了静态流水线，大幅提升了领先阿拉伯语大视觉语言模型的长文本理解能力，并发布了AraLongBench大规模阿拉伯语指标数据集。

Conclusion: 该自我迭代的防御性流程为阿拉伯语长文本问答生成提供了高效解决方案，具有自动化、可控制难度和持续改进的优势，为大视觉语言模型的进一步发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: We present an end-to-end, self-evolving adversarial workflow for long-context
Question-Answer (QA) Generation in Arabic. By orchestrating multiple
specialized LVLMs: a question generator, an evaluator, and a swarm of answer
generators, our system iteratively refines its own performance without any
human intervention. Starting from raw, multi-page Arabic documents across
diverse domains, the question generator produces fine-grained, context-aware
queries to be tackled by the answer generator swarm, and the evaluator assesses
and feeds back quality metrics. This closed-loop cycle enables continuous
learning: low-confidence outputs trigger automated re-generation and model
updates, progressively enhancing question difficulty and relevance. Moreover,
we set the quality metrics as a tunable hyperparameter, enabling question
generation at controllable and customizable difficulty levels. We release
AraLongBench, a large-scale Arabic benchmark of single- and multi-page
challenges spanning hundreds of pages, and demonstrate that our self-evolving
workflow substantially outperform static pipelines, markedly boosting the
long-context comprehension capabilities of leading Arabic Large Vision Language
Models (LVLMs). Lastly, we also meticulously architect a fully automated
agentic workflow for long-context Arabic document collection.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 性少数群体因少数群体压力而经历不成比例的高健康问题和精神障碍率，需要开发有效的方法来检测在线话语中的少数群体压力，以便进行早期干预和公共卫生政策制定。

Method: 使用ELECTRA、BERT、RoBERTa和BART等Transformer模型与传统机器学习基线及图增强变体进行对比，评估零样本和少样本学习范式，在两个最大的公开Reddit语料库（12,645和5,789个帖子）上进行实验，重复5次随机种子以确保鲁棒性。

Result: 整合图结构在所有仅Transformer模型中一致提高了检测性能，带有关系上下文的监督微调优于零样本和少样本方法，图增强通过建模社交连接和对话上下文帮助模型更好地识别身份隐藏、内化污名和求助等关键语言标记。

Conclusion: 图增强的Transformer模型为检测在线少数群体压力提供了最可靠的技术基础，对数字健康干预和公共卫生政策制定具有重要意义。

Abstract: Individuals from sexual and gender minority groups experience
disproportionately high rates of poor health outcomes and mental disorders
compared to their heterosexual and cisgender counterparts, largely as a
consequence of minority stress as described by Meyer's (2003) model. This study
presents the first comprehensive evaluation of transformer-based architectures
for detecting minority stress in online discourse. We benchmark multiple
transformer models including ELECTRA, BERT, RoBERTa, and BART against
traditional machine learning baselines and graph-augmented variants. We further
assess zero-shot and few-shot learning paradigms to assess their applicability
on underrepresented datasets. Experiments are conducted on the two largest
publicly available Reddit corpora for minority stress detection, comprising
12,645 and 5,789 posts, and are repeated over five random seeds to ensure
robustness. Our results demonstrate that integrating graph structure
consistently improves detection performance across transformer-only models and
that supervised fine-tuning with relational context outperforms zero and
few-shot approaches. Theoretical analysis reveals that modeling social
connectivity and conversational context via graph augmentation sharpens the
models' ability to identify key linguistic markers such as identity
concealment, internalized stigma, and calls for support, suggesting that
graph-enhanced transformers offer the most reliable foundation for digital
health interventions and public health policy.

TL;DR: 通过LoRA简单微调MLLM模型，可同时完成语音评估和错误检测，性能可比全量微调，为英语学习者提供更简单高效的语音训练技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语音评估系统需要复杂的架构改动或分离训练流程，这研究旨在通过简化的微调方法实现集成化的语音评估系统。

Method: 使用Microsoft Phi-4-multimodal-instruct模型，通过Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)方法进行微调，在Speechocean762数据集上训练，只微调LoRA层而不需全量微调所有音频层。

Result: 模型预测的语音评分与人工评分呈强相关性(PCC>0.7)，字符错误率(WER)和音素错误率(PER)均低于0.15，仅微调LoRA层即可达到全量微调的性能水平。

Conclusion: LoRA基础的方法能够通过简单的训练方法建立集成化语音评估系统，为英语L2学习者提供更可访、集成和高效的计算机辅助语音训练技术。

Abstract: This study demonstrates that a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) adapted
via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can perform both Automatic Pronunciation
Assessment (APA) and Mispronunciation Detection and Diagnosis (MDD)
simultaneously. Leveraging Microsoft's Phi-4-multimodal-instruct, our
fine-tuning method eliminates the need for complex architectural changes or
separate training procedures conventionally required for these distinct tasks.
Fine-tuned on the Speechocean762 dataset, the pronunciation evaluation scores
predicted by the model exhibited a strong Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC
> 0.7) with human-assigned scores, while achieving low Word Error Rate (WER)
and Phoneme Error Rate (PER) (both < 0.15). Notably, fine-tuning only the LoRA
layers was sufficient to achieve performance levels comparable to those
achieved by fine-tuning all audio layers. This research highlights that an
integrated pronunciation assessment system can be established by adapting large
multimodal models without full fine-tuning, utilizing a significantly simpler
training methodology compared to previous joint models designed for
simultaneous APA and MDD. This efficient LoRA-based approach paves the way for
more accessible, integrated, and effective Computer-Assisted Pronunciation
Training (CAPT) technologies for English L2 learners.

Result: 提取的词汇模式能够有效复现神经网络审核模型的性能，同时提供透明的决策见解，发现了社区间标准执行的显著差异

Conclusion: 该方法能够揭示之前未文档化的审核模式，包括社区特定语言容忍度、主题限制特征以及有害语言分类的深层子类别

Abstract: Effective content moderation systems require explicit classification
criteria, yet online communities like subreddits often operate with diverse,
implicit standards. This work introduces a novel approach to identify and
extract these implicit criteria from historical moderation data using an
interpretable architecture. We represent moderation criteria as score tables of
lexical expressions associated with content removal, enabling systematic
comparison across different communities. Our experiments demonstrate that these
extracted lexical patterns effectively replicate the performance of neural
moderation models while providing transparent insights into decision-making
processes. The resulting criteria matrix reveals significant variations in how
seemingly shared norms are actually enforced, uncovering previously
undocumented moderation patterns including community-specific tolerances for
language, features for topical restrictions, and underlying subcategories of
the toxic speech classification.

Abstract: Assistants on assembly tasks have a large potential to benefit humans from
everyday tasks to industrial settings. However, no testbeds support
application-oriented system evaluation in a practical setting, especially in
assembly. To foster the development, we propose a new multimodal QA dataset on
assembly activities. Our dataset, ProMQA-Assembly, consists of 391 QA pairs
that require the multimodal understanding of human-activity recordings and
their instruction manuals in an online-style manner. In the development, we
adopt a semi-automated QA annotation approach, where LLMs generate candidates
and humans verify them, as a cost-effective method, and further improve it by
integrating fine-grained action labels to diversify question types.
Furthermore, we create instruction task graphs for the target tasks of
assembling toy vehicles. These newly created task graphs are used in our
benchmarking experiment, as well as to facilitate the human verification
process in the QA annotation. Utilizing our dataset, we benchmark models,
including competitive proprietary multimodal models. Our results suggest great
room for improvement for the current models. We believe our new evaluation
dataset can contribute to the further development of procedural-activity
assistants.

Abstract: Psychotherapy reaches only a small fraction of individuals suffering from
mental disorders due to social stigma and the limited availability of
therapists. Large language models (LLMs), when equipped with professional
psychotherapeutic skills, offer a promising solution to expand access to mental
health services. However, the lack of psychological conversation datasets
presents significant challenges in developing effective psychotherapy-guided
conversational agents. In this paper, we construct a long-periodic dialogue
corpus for counseling based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Our curated
dataset includes multiple sessions for each counseling and incorporates
cognitive conceptualization diagrams (CCDs) to guide client simulation across
diverse scenarios. To evaluate the utility of our dataset, we train an in-depth
counseling model and present a comprehensive evaluation framework to benchmark
it against established psychological criteria for CBT-based counseling. Results
demonstrate that DiaCBT effectively enhances LLMs' ability to emulate
psychologists with CBT expertise, underscoring its potential for training more
professional counseling agents.

Motivation: 自动口语评估(ASA)模型在处理第二语言学习者能力评估时经常面临类别不平衡问题，导致预测结果存在偏差，影响评估的公平性和准确性。

Method: 提出Balancing Logit Variation (BLV)损失函数，通过扰动模型预测来增强少数类别的特征表示能力，该方法可以集成到基于BERT的文本模型中。

Result: 在ICNALE基准数据集上的评估显示，将BLV损失集成到BERT模型中显著提高了分类准确性和公平性，使自动语音评估对多样化学习者更加稳健。

Conclusion: BLV损失函数是一种有效的解决方案，能够在不改变数据集的情况下改善ASA模型的性能，提高对少数类别的识别能力，增强评估系统的公平性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Automated Speaking Assessment (ASA) plays a crucial role in evaluating
second-language (L2) learners proficiency. However, ASA models often suffer
from class imbalance, leading to biased predictions. To address this, we
introduce a novel objective for training ASA models, dubbed the Balancing Logit
Variation (BLV) loss, which perturbs model predictions to improve feature
representation for minority classes without modifying the dataset. Evaluations
on the ICNALE benchmark dataset show that integrating the BLV loss into a
celebrated text-based (BERT) model significantly enhances classification
accuracy and fairness, making automated speech evaluation more robust for
diverse learners.

Motivation: 现有LLM文本嵌入方法使用最终特殊标记（如[EOS]）的嵌入，但这些标记并未经过专门训练来捕获整个上下文的语义，限制了其在检索和重排序任务中的能力

Method: 在对比学习前增加新的训练阶段，采用双向生成重建任务：EBQ2D（基于嵌入的查询到文档重建）和EBD2Q（基于嵌入的文档到查询重建），交替锚定[EOS]嵌入并重建查询-文档对的两端

Result: 实验结果显示该方法在Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB)上显著提升LLM性能，在不同LLM基础模型和规模上都达到了新的最先进结果

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have increasingly been explored as powerful text
embedders. Existing LLM-based text embedding approaches often leverage the
embedding of the final token, typically a reserved special token such as [EOS].
However, these tokens have not been intentionally trained to capture the
semantics of the whole context, limiting their capacity as text embeddings,
especially for retrieval and re-ranking tasks. We propose to add a new training
stage before contrastive learning to enrich the semantics of the final token
embedding. This stage employs bidirectional generative reconstruction tasks,
namely EBQ2D (Embedding-Based Query-to-Document) and EBD2Q (Embedding-Based
Document-to-Query), which interleave to anchor the [EOS] embedding and
reconstruct either side of Query-Document pairs. Experimental results
demonstrate that our additional training stage significantly improves LLM
performance on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB), achieving new
state-of-the-art results across different LLM base models and scales.

Conclusion: 所提出的方法通过结构可学习机制有效提升了模型的多任务适应能力和鲁棒性，为参数高效微调提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper addresses the issues of parameter redundancy, rigid structure, and
limited task adaptability in the fine-tuning of large language models. It
proposes an adapter-based fine-tuning method built on a structure-learnable
mechanism. By introducing differentiable gating functions and structural
sparsity control variables, the method enables automatic optimization of
adapter insertion points, activation paths, and module combinations. This
allows the model to adjust its structure flexibly in multi-task settings to
match different task characteristics. With the backbone parameters kept frozen,
the method uses a structure search mechanism to guide the dynamic construction
of task-specific efficient substructures during training. This significantly
improves parameter utilization and representational capacity. In addition, the
paper designs a set of sensitivity analysis experiments to systematically
evaluate the effects of sparsity weight, noise injection ratio, and data
perturbation on model performance. These experiments verify the stability and
robustness of the proposed method across various multi-task natural language
understanding tasks. The experimental results show that the proposed method
outperforms mainstream parameter-efficient tuning techniques on multiple tasks.
It achieves a better balance among accuracy, compression rate, and robustness
to noise and perturbation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商业情感分析是自然语言处理中的重要应用领域，传统RNN模型存在梯度消失问题，需要改进模型来提高情感分析的准确性。

Method: 使用长短期记忆网络(LSTM)作为改进的RNN模型，采用产品评论数据集，70%数据用于训练，30%用于测试，并与传统RNN模型进行对比。

Result: 提出的改进RNN模型达到了91.33%的准确率，性能优于传统RNN模型。

Conclusion: LSTM模型能有效解决梯度消失问题，在商业情感分析中表现优异，可帮助企业分析客户反馈并优化营销策略。

Abstract: Business sentiment analysis (BSA) is one of the significant and popular
topics of natural language processing. It is one kind of sentiment analysis
techniques for business purposes. Different categories of sentiment analysis
techniques like lexicon-based techniques and different types of machine
learning algorithms are applied for sentiment analysis on different languages
like English, Hindi, Spanish, etc. In this paper, long short-term memory (LSTM)
is applied for business sentiment analysis, where a recurrent neural network is
used. An LSTM model is used in a modified approach to prevent the vanishing
gradient problem rather than applying the conventional recurrent neural network
(RNN). To apply the modified RNN model, product review dataset is used. In this
experiment, 70\% of the data is trained for the LSTM and the rest 30\% of the
data is used for testing. The result of this modified RNN model is compared
with other conventional RNN models, and a comparison is made among the results.
It is noted that the proposed model performs better than the other conventional
RNN models. Here, the proposed model, i.e., the modified RNN model approach has
achieved around 91.33\% of accuracy. By applying this model, any business
company or e-commerce business site can identify the feedback from their
customers about different types of products that customers like or dislike.
Based on the customer reviews, a business company or e-commerce platform can
evaluate its marketing strategy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文评估了四种使用大语言模型(LLMs)测量社会科学中连续标量构念的方法，发现基于token概率加权的点式评分优于直接评分和成对比较，而微调小模型也能达到或超过提示LLMs的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言构念如复杂性或情感性具有自然的连续语义结构，但LLMs对数值输出的特殊处理方式引发了如何最佳应用它们来测量标量构念的问题。

Method: 使用政治科学文献中的多个数据集，评估了四种方法：无加权的直接点式评分、成对比较聚合、token概率加权的点式评分以及微调方法。

Result: 直接提示LLMs生成点式分数会产生不连续分布；成对比较能提高测量质量；token概率加权点式评分效果更好；微调小模型(仅需1000个训练对)能匹配或超过提示LLMs的性能。

Conclusion: 研究为应用研究人员提供了实用指导：推荐使用token概率加权方法或微调小模型来获得更准确的标量构念测量结果，而非直接使用LLMs的点式评分。

Abstract: Many constructs that characterize language, like its complexity or
emotionality, have a naturally continuous semantic structure; a public speech
is not just "simple" or "complex," but exists on a continuum between extremes.
Although large language models (LLMs) are an attractive tool for measuring
scalar constructs, their idiosyncratic treatment of numerical outputs raises
questions of how to best apply them. We address these questions with a
comprehensive evaluation of LLM-based approaches to scalar construct
measurement in social science. Using multiple datasets sourced from the
political science literature, we evaluate four approaches: unweighted direct
pointwise scoring, aggregation of pairwise comparisons,
token-probability-weighted pointwise scoring, and finetuning. Our study yields
actionable findings for applied researchers. First, LLMs prompted to generate
pointwise scores directly from texts produce discontinuous distributions with
bunching at arbitrary numbers. The quality of the measurements improves with
pairwise comparisons made by LLMs, but it improves even more by taking
pointwise scores and weighting them by token probability. Finally, finetuning
smaller models with as few as 1,000 training pairs can match or exceed the
performance of prompted LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种轻量级的LLM矩阵指纹注入方法，通过知识编辑技术和指纹子空间感知细调方法，有效减少指纹退化并提升IP保护效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的指令微调指纹注入方法存在模型性能下降、计算资源消耗大、持续性差等问题，需要更轻量级且更适合的IP保护方案。

Method: 首次将知识编辑应用于指纹注入，并提出Fingerprint Subspace-aware Fine-Tuning (FSFT)方法，通过限制指纹子空间的更新来减少指纹退化。使用类似乱码文本的指纹以防止细调过程中被覆盖。

Result: FSFT方法在最坏情况下也能超过普通细调10%，显示出良好的指纹保持能力。同时发现指纹注入后的模型存在区分指纹与相似文本的困难。

Conclusion: 知识编辑是一种有效的轻量级指纹注入方法，FSFT技术能够显著提升指纹的持续性。相似特征导致的区分困难表明需要更加健壮和细粒度的指纹注入方法。

Abstract: The intellectual property (IP) protection of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
increasingly critical. Injecting specialized fingerprints into LLMs through
instruction tuning is a common IP protection technique. However, this may
significantly degrade model performance, requires substantial computational
resources, and exhibits poor persistence under model modifications. We argue
that knowledge editing offers a lightweight alternative that is more suitable
for fingerprint injection. Accordingly, we apply knowledge editing to
fingerprint injection for the first time and demonstrate its strong capability.
Despite using scrambled text as fingerprints to prevent them from being
overwritten during fine-tuning, degradation still occurs under large-scale
fine-tuning. To address this, we propose Fingerprint Subspace-aware Fine-Tuning
(FSFT), which reduces fingerprint degradation by constraining the update of the
fingerprint subspace. The performance of FSFT exceeds fine-tuning by 10% even
in the worst-case scenario. Additionally, we observe that the
fingerprint-injected models struggle to distinguish between fingerprints and
similar texts due to the high similarity of their features. This finding
underscores the urgent need for more robust and fine-grained fingerprinting
injection methods for LLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究计算心理词典模型(DLM)生成的词汇处理测量是否能够预测眼动和命名反应变量，并与传统预测因子进行比较，以了解词汇处理中形式和意义映射的作用。

Method: 采用大规模单被试实验，结合词汇命名任务和眼动追踪技术，分析五个反应变量(首次注视时长、总注视时长、注视次数、命名潜伏期和口语词时长)，使用广义可加模型进行统计分析。

Result: 1) DLM测量是词汇处理的有力预测因子；2) 基于深度学习的DLM测量不一定比线性映射的DLM测量更精确；3) 传统预测因子通常比DLM预测因子更精确(总注视时长除外)；4) 命名任务中词汇变量不能预测首次注视时长和总注视次数。

Conclusion: DLM基于形式到意义的映射，其对总注视时长、命名潜伏期和口语词时长的预测能力表明，在当前词汇命名任务中意义处理起着重要作用。

Abstract: This study investigates lexical processing in Estonian. A large-scale
single-subject experiment is reported that combines the word naming task with
eye-tracking. Five response variables (first fixation duration, total fixation
duration, number of fixations, word naming latency, and spoken word duration)
are analyzed with the generalized additive model. Of central interest is the
question of whether measures for lexical processing generated by a
computational model of the mental lexicon (the Discriminative Lexicon Model,
DLM) are predictive for these response variables, and how they compare to
classical predictors such as word frequency, neighborhood size, and
inflectional paradigm size. Computational models were implemented both with
linear and deep mappings. Central findings are, first, that DLM-based measures
are powerful predictors for lexical processing, second, that DLM-measures using
deep learning are not necessarily more precise predictors of lexical processing
than DLM-measures using linear mappings, third, that classical predictors tend
to provide somewhat more precise fits compared to DLM-based predictors (except
for total fixation duration, where the two provide equivalent goodness of fit),
and fourth, that in the naming task lexical variables are not predictive for
first fixation duration and the total number of fixations. As the DLM works
with mappings from form to meaning, the predictivity of DLM-based measures for
total fixation duration, naming latencies, and spoken word duration indicates
that meaning is heavily involved in the present word naming task.

automatic evaluation of existing MT systems and LLMs shows that translation out
of Romansh into German is handled relatively well for all the varieties, but
translation into Romansh is still challenging.

Method: 采用参数高效微调技术来降低计算开销，专注于预测性过程监控任务，包括单任务和多任务预测设置。

Result: 实验结果显示在多任务设置中，该方法在预测性能上优于最先进的RNN方法和基于自然语言的解决方案，同时微调模型收敛更快且需要更少的超参数优化。

Conclusion: 直接微调预训练LLMs处理过程数据是一种有效的方法，特别是在多任务预测场景中表现出色，具有更好的性能和更高的效率。

Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a prominent
area of interest across various research domains, including Process Mining
(PM). Current applications in PM have predominantly centered on prompt
engineering strategies or the transformation of event logs into narrative-style
datasets, thereby exploiting the semantic capabilities of LLMs to address
diverse tasks. In contrast, this study investigates the direct adaptation of
pretrained LLMs to process data without natural language reformulation,
motivated by the fact that these models excel in generating sequences of
tokens, similar to the objective in PM. More specifically, we focus on
parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques to mitigate the computational
overhead typically associated with such models. Our experimental setup focuses
on Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM), and considers both single- and
multi-task predictions. The results demonstrate a potential improvement in
predictive performance over state-of-the-art recurrent neural network (RNN)
approaches and recent narrative-style-based solutions, particularly in the
multi-task setting. Additionally, our fine-tuned models exhibit faster
convergence and require significantly less hyperparameter optimization.

Method: 创建专门针对僧伽罗语的SinhalaMMLU数据集，基于斯里兰卡国家课程，包含从中学到大学教育水平的7000多个问题，涵盖6个领域30个学科。

Result: 评估26个LLM，Claude 3.5 sonnet和GPT-4o表现最佳（67%和62%准确率），但整体性能有限，在人文学科等文化丰富领域表现尤其不佳。

Conclusion: LLM在适应低资源语言和文化特定语境方面仍有很大改进空间，需要专门针对不同文化和语言背景的评估基准。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive general knowledge and
reasoning abilities, yet their evaluation has predominantly focused on global
or anglocentric subjects, often neglecting low-resource languages and
culturally specific content. While recent multilingual benchmarks attempt to
bridge this gap, many rely on automatic translation, which can introduce errors
and misrepresent the original cultural context. To address this, we introduce
SinhalaMMLU, the first multiple-choice question answering benchmark designed
specifically for Sinhala, a low-resource language. The dataset includes over
7,000 questions spanning secondary to collegiate education levels, aligned with
the Sri Lankan national curriculum, and covers six domains and 30 subjects,
encompassing both general academic topics and culturally grounded knowledge. We
evaluate 26 LLMs on SinhalaMMLU and observe that, while Claude 3.5 sonnet and
GPT-4o achieve the highest average accuracies at 67% and 62% respectively,
overall model performance remains limited. In particular, models struggle in
culturally rich domains such as the Humanities, revealing substantial room for
improvement in adapting LLMs to low-resource and culturally specific contexts.

Result: AgenTracer-8B在Who&When基准测试中比Gemini-2.5-Pro和Claude-4-Sonnet等大型专有LLM性能提升高达18.18%，并为MetaGPT和MaAS等多智能体系统带来4.8-14.2%的性能增益。

Conclusion: AgenTracer-8B为多智能体系统故障归因设立了新标准，能够提供可操作的反馈，赋能自校正和自进化的智能体AI系统。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agentic systems, often comprising multiple
models, complex tool invocations, and orchestration protocols, substantially
outperform monolithic agents. Yet this very sophistication amplifies their
fragility, making them more prone to system failure. Pinpointing the specific
agent or step responsible for an error within long execution traces defines the
task of agentic system failure attribution. Current state-of-the-art reasoning
LLMs, however, remain strikingly inadequate for this challenge, with accuracy
generally below 10%. To address this gap, we propose AgenTracer, the first
automated framework for annotating failed multi-agent trajectories via
counterfactual replay and programmed fault injection, producing the curated
dataset TracerTraj. Leveraging this resource, we develop AgenTracer-8B, a
lightweight failure tracer trained with multi-granular reinforcement learning,
capable of efficiently diagnosing errors in verbose multi-agent interactions.
On the Who&When benchmark, AgenTracer-8B outperforms giant proprietary LLMs
like Gemini-2.5-Pro and Claude-4-Sonnet by up to 18.18%, setting a new standard
in LLM agentic failure attribution. More importantly, AgenTracer-8B delivers
actionable feedback to off-the-shelf multi-agent systems like MetaGPT and MaAS
with 4.8-14.2% performance gains, empowering self-correcting and self-evolving
agentic AI.

Result: LMEnt在知识基准测试中与流行开源模型性能相当，研究发现事实频率是关键因素但不能完全解释学习趋势

Conclusion: LMEnt为研究语言模型中的知识表示、可塑性、编辑、归因和学习动态提供了有价值的资源和支持

Abstract: Language models (LMs) increasingly drive real-world applications that require
world knowledge. However, the internal processes through which models turn data
into representations of knowledge and beliefs about the world, are poorly
understood. Insights into these processes could pave the way for developing LMs
with knowledge representations that are more consistent, robust, and complete.
To facilitate studying these questions, we present LMEnt, a suite for analyzing
knowledge acquisition in LMs during pretraining. LMEnt introduces: (1) a
knowledge-rich pretraining corpus, fully annotated with entity mentions, based
on Wikipedia, (2) an entity-based retrieval method over pretraining data that
outperforms previous approaches by as much as 80.4%, and (3) 12 pretrained
models with up to 1B parameters and 4K intermediate checkpoints, with
comparable performance to popular open-sourced models on knowledge benchmarks.
Together, these resources provide a controlled environment for analyzing
connections between entity mentions in pretraining and downstream performance,
and the effects of causal interventions in pretraining data. We show the
utility of LMEnt by studying knowledge acquisition across checkpoints, finding
that fact frequency is key, but does not fully explain learning trends. We
release LMEnt to support studies of knowledge in LMs, including knowledge
representations, plasticity, editing, attribution, and learning dynamics.

Conclusion: 预训练生成高阶语言结构，其机制在NLP和图像分类中具有普适性，预训练成功直接反映在微调性能提升上。

Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP) enables the understanding and generation of
meaningful human language, typically using a pre-trained complex architecture
on a large dataset to learn the language and next fine-tune its weights to
implement a specific task. Twofold goals are examined; to understand the
mechanism underlying successful pre-training and to determine the interplay
between the pre-training accuracy and the fine-tuning of classification tasks.
The following main results were obtained; the accuracy per token (APT)
increased with its appearance frequency in the dataset, and its average over
all tokens served as an order parameter to quantify pre-training success, which
increased along the transformer blocks. Pre-training broke the symmetry among
tokens and grouped them into finite, small, strong match token clusters, as
inferred from the presented token confusion matrix. This feature was sharpened
along the transformer blocks toward the output layer, enhancing its performance
considerably compared with that of the embedding layer. Consequently,
higher-order language structures were generated by pre-training, even though
the learning cost function was directed solely at identifying a single token.
These pre-training findings were reflected by the improved fine-tuning accuracy
along the transformer blocks. Additionally, the output label prediction
confidence was found to be independent of the average input APT, as the input
meaning was preserved since the tokens are replaced primarily by strong match
tokens. Finally, although pre-training is commonly absent in image
classification tasks, its underlying mechanism is similar to that used in
fine-tuning NLP classification tasks, hinting at its universality. The results
were based on the BERT-6 architecture pre-trained on the Wikipedia dataset and
fine-tuned on the FewRel and DBpedia classification tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文构建了ComplexEval基准测试，系统性地揭示了LLM作为评估者时存在的辅助信息诱导偏见问题，发现在复杂任务中所有模型都表现出显著的偏见敏感性，且偏见程度随任务复杂度增加而加剧。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型处理的任务越来越复杂多样，可靠的评估变得困难。LLM作为评估者的方法虽然可扩展，但在复杂任务中的可靠性尚未得到充分研究，特别是涉及多维度评分标准、非结构化参考答案和细微评判标准的情况。

Method: 构建ComplexEval挑战基准，系统性地研究和验证6种先前未探索的偏见，涵盖12个基础场景和3个高级场景，深入分析模型对这些偏见的敏感性。

Result: 所有评估模型都表现出对这些偏见的显著敏感性，偏见程度随任务复杂度增加而加剧；大型推理模型(LRMs)表现出矛盾的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 研究为改进评估信号的准确性和可验证性提供了关键见解，为开发更通用和鲁棒的评估模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow more capable, they face increasingly
diverse and complex tasks, making reliable evaluation challenging. The paradigm
of LLMs as judges has emerged as a scalable solution, yet prior work primarily
focuses on simple settings. Their reliability in complex tasks--where
multi-faceted rubrics, unstructured reference answers, and nuanced criteria are
critical--remains understudied. In this paper, we constructed ComplexEval, a
challenge benchmark designed to systematically expose and quantify Auxiliary
Information Induced Biases. We systematically investigated and validated 6
previously unexplored biases across 12 basic and 3 advanced scenarios. Key
findings reveal: (1) all evaluated models exhibit significant susceptibility to
these biases, with bias magnitude scaling with task complexity; (2) notably,
Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) show paradoxical vulnerability. Our in-depth
analysis offers crucial insights for improving the accuracy and verifiability
of evaluation signals, paving the way for more general and robust evaluation
models.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了第一个连续沙特手语语料集KAU-CSSL和一种基于Transformer的模型，在语者依赖模式下达到99.02%准确率，为阿拉伯手语识别提供了重要资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 沙特手语(SSL)作为过蓬4万人的主要沟通方式，但现有技术主要集中在非阿拉伯手语，导致阿拉伯手语资源缺乏，特别是缺少连续语句级别的语料集。

Method: 研究提出了KAU-CSSL连续沙特手语语料集，并设计了一种基于Transformer的模型：使用预训练ResNet-18进行空间特征提取，结合Transformer Encoder和双向LSTM处理时序依赖关系。

Result: 模型在语者依赖模式下达到99.02%的高准确率，在语者独立模式下也获得77.71%的准确率。

Conclusion: 这项研究为沙特手语社区提供了重要的沟通工具，并对手语识别领域做出了重要贡献，特别是在阿拉伯手语识别资源缺乏的情况下。

Abstract: Sign language (SL) is an essential communication form for hearing-impaired
and deaf people, enabling engagement within the broader society. Despite its
significance, limited public awareness of SL often leads to inequitable access
to educational and professional opportunities, thereby contributing to social
exclusion, particularly in Saudi Arabia, where over 84,000 individuals depend
on Saudi Sign Language (SSL) as their primary form of communication. Although
certain technological approaches have helped to improve communication for
individuals with hearing impairments, there continues to be an urgent
requirement for more precise and dependable translation techniques, especially
for Arabic sign language variants like SSL. Most state-of-the-art solutions
have primarily focused on non-Arabic sign languages, resulting in a
considerable absence of resources dedicated to Arabic sign language,
specifically SSL. The complexity of the Arabic language and the prevalence of
isolated sign language datasets that concentrate on individual words instead of
continuous speech contribute to this issue. To address this gap, our research
represents an important step in developing SSL resources. To address this, we
introduce the first continuous Saudi Sign Language dataset called KAU-CSSL,
focusing on complete sentences to facilitate further research and enable
sophisticated recognition systems for SSL recognition and translation.
Additionally, we propose a transformer-based model, utilizing a pretrained
ResNet-18 for spatial feature extraction and a Transformer Encoder with
Bidirectional LSTM for temporal dependencies, achieving 99.02\% accuracy at
signer dependent mode and 77.71\% accuracy at signer independent mode. This
development leads the way to not only improving communication tools for the SSL
community but also making a substantial contribution to the wider field of sign
language.

has becomeprogressively popular. In this paper, a novel approach to agent
design and agent learning ispresented with the context of reinforcement
learning. A model of deep learning is first applied toprocess game text and
build a world model. Next, the agent is learned through a policy gradient-based
deep reinforcement learning method to facilitate conversion from state value to
optimal policy.The enhanced agent works better in several text-based game
experiments and significantlysurpasses previous agents on game completion ratio
and win rate. Our study introduces novelunderstanding and empirical ground for
using reinforcement learning for text games and sets thestage for developing
and optimizing reinforcement learning agents for more general domains

Method: 创建了自利性的AI创造者和用户的人工群体，通过进化游戏理论进行研究

Result: 研究结果显示媒体确实能够促进创造者与用户之间的合作，但需要满足信息质量可靠、访问成本低、安全成本合理等条件

Conclusion: 媒体通过形成公众意见和负责任制约机制，可以在没有政府正式监管的情况下作为一种强大的软性监管方式来促进AI安全

Abstract: When developers of artificial intelligence (AI) products need to decide
between profit and safety for the users, they likely choose profit.
Untrustworthy AI technology must come packaged with tangible negative
consequences. Here, we envisage those consequences as the loss of reputation
caused by media coverage of their misdeeds, disseminated to the public. We
explore whether media coverage has the potential to push AI creators into the
production of safe products, enabling widespread adoption of AI technology. We
created artificial populations of self-interested creators and users and
studied them through the lens of evolutionary game theory. Our results reveal
that media is indeed able to foster cooperation between creators and users, but
not always. Cooperation does not evolve if the quality of the information
provided by the media is not reliable enough, or if the costs of either
accessing media or ensuring safety are too high. By shaping public perception
and holding developers accountable, media emerges as a powerful soft regulator
-- guiding AI safety even in the absence of formal government oversight.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前高层次世界模型在语义和时间抽象方面的推理能力不足，需要开发能够理解动作语义和进行时序抽象的世界模型

Method: 使用LLM自优化提取目标，学习动作策略和动态模型，通过双系统规划（反应式系统1和反思式系统2）进行成本最小化规划

Result: 在VPA基准测试和PlannerArena人工评估中达到最先进性能，系统2比系统1Elo分数提升27%，在RoboVQA和WorldPrediction基准上也优于强VLM基线

Conclusion: VLWM通过语言基础的世界建模和双系统规划框架，有效提升了视觉规划能力，为高层次世界模型的发展提供了新方向

Abstract: Effective planning requires strong world models, but high-level world models
that can understand and reason about actions with semantic and temporal
abstraction remain largely underdeveloped. We introduce the Vision Language
World Model (VLWM), a foundation model trained for language-based world
modeling on natural videos. Given visual observations, the VLWM first infers
the overall goal achievements then predicts a trajectory composed of
interleaved actions and world state changes. Those targets are extracted by
iterative LLM Self-Refine conditioned on compressed future observations
represented by Tree of Captions. The VLWM learns both an action policy and a
dynamics model, which respectively facilitates reactive system-1 plan decoding
and reflective system-2 planning via cost minimization. The cost evaluates the
semantic distance between the hypothetical future states given by VLWM
roll-outs and the expected goal state, and is measured by a critic model that
we trained in a self-supervised manner. The VLWM achieves state-of-the-art
Visual Planning for Assistance (VPA) performance on both benchmark evaluations
and our proposed PlannerArena human evaluations, where system-2 improves the
Elo score by +27% upon system-1. The VLWM models also outperforms strong VLM
baselines on RoboVQA and WorldPrediction benchmark.

Conclusion: 该原型系统成功证明了结合语义算子优化执行和深度研究系统灵活性的可行性，为AI驱动分析提供了更高效的运行时解决方案

Abstract: With advances in large language models (LLMs), researchers are creating new
systems that can perform AI-driven analytics over large unstructured datasets.
Recent work has explored executing such analytics queries using semantic
operators -- a declarative set of AI-powered data transformations with natural
language specifications. However, even when optimized, these operators can be
expensive to execute on millions of records and their iterator execution
semantics make them ill-suited for interactive data analytics tasks. In another
line of work, Deep Research systems have demonstrated an ability to answer
natural language question(s) over large datasets. These systems use one or more
LLM agent(s) to plan their execution, process the dataset(s), and iteratively
refine their answer. However, these systems do not explicitly optimize their
query plans which can lead to poor plan execution. In order for AI-driven
analytics to excel, we need a runtime which combines the optimized execution of
semantic operators with the flexibility and more dynamic execution of Deep
Research systems. As a first step towards this vision, we build a prototype
which enables Deep Research agents to write and execute optimized semantic
operator programs. We evaluate our prototype and demonstrate that it can
outperform a handcrafted semantic operator program and open Deep Research
systems on two basic queries. Compared to a standard open Deep Research agent,
our prototype achieves up to 1.95x better F1-score. Furthermore, even if we
give the agent access to semantic operators as tools, our prototype still
achieves cost and runtime savings of up to 76.8% and 72.7% thanks to its
optimized execution.

Method: 综合评估五个关键LLM模块：标记化器设计、位置嵌入、预训练范式、训练后策略和测试时计算，在Waymo Sim Agents基准上进行广泛实验

Result: 通过适当的适应性改造，这些模块能够显著提高自主驾驶运动生成的性能，在Sim Agents任务中获得竞争力结果

Conclusion: 识别了可有效转移的技术，分析了其他技术失败的潜在原因，并讨论了自主驾驶场景的特定适应需求

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have not only advanced
natural language processing but also inspired their application in domains with
structurally similar problems--most notably, autonomous driving motion
generation. Both domains involve autoregressive sequence modeling, token-based
representations, and context-aware decision making, making the transfer of LLM
components a natural and increasingly common practice. However, despite
promising early attempts, a systematic understanding of which LLM modules are
truly transferable remains lacking. In this paper, we present a comprehensive
evaluation of five key LLM modules--tokenizer design, positional embedding,
pre-training paradigms, post-training strategies, and test-time
computation--within the context of motion generation for autonomous driving.
Through extensive experiments on the Waymo Sim Agents benchmark, we demonstrate
that, when appropriately adapted, these modules can significantly improve
performance for autonomous driving motion generation. In addition, we identify
which techniques can be effectively transferred, analyze the potential reasons
for the failure of others, and discuss the specific adaptations needed for
autonomous driving scenarios. We evaluate our method on the Sim Agents task and
achieve competitive results.

Result: 在TEACh数据集上达到90%召回率和100%精确度，96.5%序列最多只需3次迭代，改善时间和空间效率

Conclusion: 该方法为具身AI中的模仿学习提供了可扩展的高质量训练数据生成路径，支持鲁棒的纠错行为研究

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) based task plans and corresponding human
demonstrations for embodied AI may be noisy, with unnecessary actions,
redundant navigation, and logical errors that reduce policy quality. We propose
an iterative verification framework in which a Judge LLM critiques action
sequences and a Planner LLM applies the revisions, yielding progressively
cleaner and more spatially coherent trajectories. Unlike rule-based approaches,
our method relies on natural language prompting, enabling broad generalization
across error types including irrelevant actions, contradictions, and missing
steps. On a set of manually annotated actions from the TEACh embodied AI
dataset, our framework achieves up to 90% recall and 100% precision across four
state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT o4-mini, DeepSeek-R1, Gemini 2.5, LLaMA 4 Scout).
The refinement loop converges quickly, with 96.5% of sequences requiring at
most three iterations, while improving both temporal efficiency and spatial
action organization. Crucially, the method preserves human error-recovery
patterns rather than collapsing them, supporting future work on robust
corrective behavior. By establishing plan verification as a reliable LLM
capability for spatial planning and action refinement, we provide a scalable
path to higher-quality training data for imitation learning in embodied AI.

Motivation: 现有选择超启发式主要关注从预定义集合中自适应选择低层启发式，而本文专注于该集合的组成及其策略转换，以提炼问题特定启发式搜索算法为可适应的通用搜索策略。

Method: 系统分析基于三个关键原则的转换：解决方案接受度、低层启发式重复和扰动强度（即扰动性低层启发式影响的解决方案比例），并在简单的无偏随机选择机制上验证转换效果。

Result: 通过适当构建的转换，这种简单方法在三个具有挑战性的实际领域超越了所有现有最先进的超启发式，发现了11个新的最佳已知解决方案，并与CHeSC竞赛获胜者竞争。

Conclusion: 策略转换方法不仅简化了现有超启发式设计，还在CHeSC基准和实际领域上都超越了当前最先进方法，证明了其在跨域搜索中的有效性。

Abstract: Cross-domain selection hyper-heuristics aim to distill decades of research on
problem-specific heuristic search algorithms into adaptable general-purpose
search strategies. In this respect, existing selection hyper-heuristics
primarily focus on an adaptive selection of low-level heuristics (LLHs) from a
predefined set. In contrast, we concentrate on the composition of this set and
its strategic transformations. We systematically analyze transformations based
on three key principles: solution acceptance, LLH repetitions, and perturbation
intensity, i.e., the proportion of a solution affected by a perturbative LLH.
We demonstrate the raw effects of our transformations on a trivial unbiased
random selection mechanism. With an appropriately constructed transformation,
this trivial method outperforms all available state-of-the-art hyper-heuristics
on three challenging real-world domains and finds 11 new best-known solutions.
The same method is competitive with the winner of the CHeSC competition,
commonly used as the standard cross-domain benchmark. Moreover, we accompany
several recent hyper-heuristics with such strategic transformations. Using this
approach, we outperform the current state-of-the-art methods on both the CHeSC
benchmark and real-world domains while often simplifying their designs.

Conclusion: 该符号学习方法突破了传统组合方法的规模限制，为大规模规划问题的策略学习提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Combinatorial methods for learning general policies that solve large
collections of planning problems have been recently developed. One of their
strengths, in relation to deep learning approaches, is that the resulting
policies can be understood and shown to be correct. A weakness is that the
methods do not scale up and learn only from small training instances and
feature pools that contain a few hundreds of states and features at most. In
this work, we propose a new symbolic method for learning policies based on the
generalization of sampled plans that ensures structural termination and hence
acyclicity. The proposed learning approach is not based on SAT/ASP, as previous
symbolic methods, but on a hitting set algorithm that can effectively handle
problems with millions of states, and pools with hundreds of thousands of
features. The formal properties of the approach are analyzed, and its
scalability is tested on a number of benchmarks.

Abstract: Adaptive exploration methods propose ways to learn complex policies via
alternating between exploration and exploitation. An important question for
such methods is to determine the appropriate moment to switch between
exploration and exploitation and vice versa. This is critical in domains that
require the learning of long and complex sequences of actions. In this work, we
present a generic adaptive exploration framework that employs uncertainty to
address this important issue in a principled manner. Our framework includes
previous adaptive exploration approaches as special cases. Moreover, we can
incorporate in our framework any uncertainty-measuring mechanism of choice, for
instance mechanisms used in intrinsic motivation or epistemic uncertainty-based
exploration methods. We experimentally demonstrate that our framework gives
rise to adaptive exploration strategies that outperform standard ones across
several MuJoCo environments.

Abstract: AI is transforming the healthcare domain and is increasingly helping
practitioners to make health-related decisions. Therefore, accountability
becomes a crucial concern for critical AI-driven decisions. Although regulatory
bodies, such as the EU commission, provide guidelines, they are highlevel and
focus on the ''what'' that should be done and less on the ''how'', creating a
knowledge gap for actors. Through an extensive analysis, we found that the term
accountability is perceived and dealt with in many different ways, depending on
the actor's expertise and domain of work. With increasing concerns about AI
accountability issues and the ambiguity around this term, this paper bridges
the gap between the ''what'' and ''how'' of AI accountability, specifically for
AI systems in healthcare. We do this by analysing the concept of
accountability, formulating an accountability framework, and providing a
three-tier structure for handling various accountability mechanisms. Our
accountability framework positions the regulations of healthcare AI systems and
the mechanisms adopted by the actors under a consistent accountability regime.
Moreover, the three-tier structure guides the actors of the healthcare AI
system to categorise the mechanisms based on their conduct. Through our
framework, we advocate that decision-making in healthcare AI holds shared
dependencies, where accountability should be dealt with jointly and should
foster collaborations. We highlight the role of explainability in instigating
communication and information sharing between the actors to further facilitate
the collaborative process.

Abstract: We present app.build (https://github.com/appdotbuild/agent/), an open-source
framework that improves LLM-based application generation through systematic
validation and structured environments. Our approach combines multi-layered
validation pipelines, stack-specific orchestration, and model-agnostic
architecture, implemented across three reference stacks. Through evaluation on
30 generation tasks, we demonstrate that comprehensive validation achieves
73.3% viability rate with 30% reaching perfect quality scores, while
open-weights models achieve 80.8% of closed-model performance when provided
structured environments. The open-source framework has been adopted by the
community, with over 3,000 applications generated to date. This work
demonstrates that scaling reliable AI agents requires scaling environments, not
just models -- providing empirical insights and complete reference
implementations for production-oriented agent systems.

*Yunxin Sun,Abulhair Saparov*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了InAbHyD数据集来评估大语言模型的归纳和溯因推理能力，发现LLMs在简单场景中能进行这类推理，但在复杂世界模型中表现不佳


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数研究只关注演绎推理，而归纳和溯因推理在解决现实问题中同样重要但较少被探索

Method: 创建可编程合成数据集InAbHyD，包含不完整世界模型和观察数据，要求智能体产生解释性假设，并基于奥卡姆剃刀原理提出新评估指标

Result: LLMs在简单场景中能进行归纳和溯因推理，但在复杂世界模型中表现不佳，即使使用上下文学习和RLVR等推理增强技术

Conclusion: 需要进一步研究提升LLMs在复杂场景中的归纳和溯因推理能力

Abstract: Reasoning is a core capability in artificial intelligence systems, for which
large language models (LLMs) have recently shown remarkable progress. However,
most work focuses exclusively on deductive reasoning, which is problematic
since other types of reasoning are also essential in solving real-world
problems, and they are less explored. This work focuses on evaluating LLMs'
inductive and abductive reasoning capabilities. We introduce a programmable and
synthetic dataset, InAbHyD (pronounced in-a-bid), where each reasoning example
consists of an incomplete world model and a set of observations. The task for
the intelligent agent is to produce hypotheses to explain observations under
the incomplete world model to solve each reasoning example. We propose a new
metric to evaluate the quality of hypotheses based on Occam's Razor. We
evaluate and analyze some state-of-the-art LLMs. Our analysis shows that LLMs
can perform inductive and abductive reasoning in simple scenarios, but struggle
with complex world models and producing high-quality hypotheses, even with
popular reasoning-enhancing techniques such as in-context learning and RLVR.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于环境变化的AI智能体框架，通过引入"aspects"概念实现零信息泄露，相比传统架构83%的信息泄露率有显著改进


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI智能体往往只是自主聊天机器人，遵循脚本并由不可靠的控制器指导，存在信息泄露和效率问题

Method: 提出自下而上的框架，将AI智能体置于环境中，所有行为由环境变化触发；引入类似"umwelt"的aspects概念，使不同智能体以不同方式感知环境

Result: 相比典型架构83%的信息泄露率，aspective agentic AI实现了零信息泄露

Conclusion: 专业智能体在各自信息生态位中高效工作的概念可以同时提升安全性和效率

Abstract: Agentic LLM AI agents are often little more than autonomous chatbots: actors
following scripts, often controlled by an unreliable director. This work
introduces a bottom-up framework that situates AI agents in their environment,
with all behaviors triggered by changes in their environments. It introduces
the notion of aspects, similar to the idea of umwelt, where sets of agents
perceive their environment differently to each other, enabling clearer control
of information. We provide an illustrative implementation and show that
compared to a typical architecture, which leaks up to 83% of the time,
aspective agentic AI enables zero information leakage. We anticipate that this
concept of specialist agents working efficiently in their own information
niches can provide improvements to both security and efficiency.

Result: 在代表性EAI模型上的评估显示，所有安全类别的攻击成功率均超过50%。展示了稀疏和自适应攻击策略，并通过物理机器人实验验证了现实世界影响。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了具身AI系统中先前未被充分探索但后果严重的攻击面，强调了物理AI时代对安全驱动防御的迫切需求。

Abstract: The integration of vision-language-action (VLA) models into embodied AI (EAI)
robots is rapidly advancing their ability to perform complex, long-horizon
tasks in humancentric environments. However, EAI systems introduce critical
security risks: a compromised VLA model can directly translate adversarial
perturbations on sensory input into unsafe physical actions. Traditional safety
definitions and methodologies from the machine learning community are no longer
sufficient. EAI systems raise new questions, such as what constitutes safety,
how to measure it, and how to design effective attack and defense mechanisms in
physically grounded, interactive settings. In this work, we present the first
systematic study of adversarial safety attacks on embodied AI systems, grounded
in ISO standards for human-robot interactions. We (1) formalize a principled
taxonomy of safety violations (critical, dangerous, risky) based on physical
constraints such as separation distance, velocity, and collision boundaries;
(2) introduce ANNIEBench, a benchmark of nine safety-critical scenarios with
2,400 video-action sequences for evaluating embodied safety; and (3)
ANNIE-Attack, a task-aware adversarial framework with an attack leader model
that decomposes long-horizon goals into frame-level perturbations. Our
evaluation across representative EAI models shows attack success rates
exceeding 50% across all safety categories. We further demonstrate sparse and
adaptive attack strategies and validate the real-world impact through physical
robot experiments. These results expose a previously underexplored but highly
consequential attack surface in embodied AI systems, highlighting the urgent
need for security-driven defenses in the physical AI era. Code is available at

*Zhuo Cao,Yunxiao Shi,Min Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAM-LLM是一种混合架构，将大语言模型的上下文推理能力与运动学车道变换模型的物理精度相结合，用于自动驾驶中的可解释车道变换轨迹预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统LLM在自动驾驶轨迹预测中输出原始坐标缺乏物理合理性和可解释性的问题，同时减少计算资源消耗。

Method: 通过微调LLM输出轨迹模型的核心物理参数（横向位移、机动持续时间、初始横向速度、纵向速度变化），而不是原始坐标。对于车道保持场景预测离散坐标，对于车道变换则生成增强正弦加速度模型(SAM)的参数。

Result: 实现了98.73%的整体意图预测准确率，与传统的LLM预测器性能相当，同时输出大小减少80%，计算效率显著提升。

Conclusion: SAM-LLM在保持高性能的同时，提供了物理上合理、连续且可解释的轨迹预测，在可解释性和资源效率方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: This work introduces SAM-LLM, a novel hybrid architecture that bridges the
gap between the contextual reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the
physical precision of kinematic lane change models for autonomous driving. The
system is designed for interpretable lane change trajectory prediction by
finetuning an LLM to output the core physical parameters of a trajectory model
instead of raw coordinates. For lane-keeping scenarios, the model predicts
discrete coordinates, but for lane change maneuvers, it generates the
parameters for an enhanced Sinusoidal Acceleration Model (SAM), including
lateral displacement, maneuver duration, initial lateral velocity, and
longitudinal velocity change. This parametric approach yields a complete,
continuous, and physically plausible trajectory model that is inherently
interpretable and computationally efficient, achieving an 80% reduction in
output size compared to coordinate-based methods. The SAM-LLM achieves a
state-of-the-art overall intention prediction accuracy of 98.73%, demonstrating
performance equivalent to traditional LLM predictors while offering significant
advantages in explainability and resource efficiency.
