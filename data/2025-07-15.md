### [1] [View Invariant Learning for Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08831)
*Josh Qixuan Sun,Xiaoying Xing,Huaiyuan Weng,Chul Min Yeum,Mark Crowley*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出VIL（View Invariant Learning），一种后训练策略，用于增强视觉语言导航（VLNCE）策略对视角变化的鲁棒性，并通过对比学习和师生框架实现。实验表明VIL在V2-VLNCE和标准VLNCE中均表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有导航策略对视角变化敏感的问题，提升在连续环境中的导航鲁棒性。

Method: 提出VIL，结合对比学习框架和师生框架，学习稀疏且视角不变的特征，并采用端到端训练优化。

Result: 在V2-VLNCE中，成功率提升8-15%；在标准VLNCE中性能也有所提升，且在RxR-CE数据集上达到最优。

Conclusion: VIL是一种即插即用的后训练方法，能显著提升导航策略的鲁棒性，且不影响标准视角性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLNCE), where an agent
follows instructions and moves freely to reach a destination, is a key research
problem in embodied AI. However, most navigation policies are sensitive to
viewpoint changes, i.e., variations in camera height and viewing angle that
alter the agent's observation. In this paper, we introduce a generalized
scenario, V2-VLNCE (VLNCE with Varied Viewpoints), and propose VIL (View
Invariant Learning), a view-invariant post-training strategy that enhances the
robustness of existing navigation policies to changes in camera viewpoint. VIL
employs a contrastive learning framework to learn sparse and view-invariant
features. Additionally, we introduce a teacher-student framework for the
Waypoint Predictor Module, a core component of most VLNCE baselines, where a
view-dependent teacher model distills knowledge into a view-invariant student
model. We employ an end-to-end training paradigm to jointly optimize these
components, thus eliminating the cost for individual module training. Empirical
results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on
V2-VLNCE by 8-15% measured on Success Rate for two standard benchmark datasets
R2R-CE and RxR-CE. Furthermore, we evaluate VIL under the standard VLNCE
setting and find that, despite being trained for varied viewpoints, it often
still improves performance. On the more challenging RxR-CE dataset, our method
also achieved state-of-the-art performance across all metrics when compared to
other map-free methods. This suggests that adding VIL does not diminish the
standard viewpoint performance and can serve as a plug-and-play post-training
method.

### [2] [Detecting Deepfake Talking Heads from Facial Biometric Anomalies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08917)
*Justin D. Norman,Hany Farid*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于面部生物特征异常模式的深度学习伪造视频检测方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前高度逼真的语音克隆和视频伪造技术容易被用于欺诈和政治虚假信息，亟需有效的检测手段。

Method: 利用面部生物特征中的异常模式，开发了一种新的机器学习检测技术。

Result: 在大规模伪造视频数据集上验证了该技术的有效性，并评估了其对视频篡改的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法在检测伪造视频方面表现出色，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The combination of highly realistic voice cloning, along with visually
compelling avatar, face-swap, or lip-sync deepfake video generation, makes it
relatively easy to create a video of anyone saying anything. Today, such
deepfake impersonations are often used to power frauds, scams, and political
disinformation. We propose a novel forensic machine learning technique for the
detection of deepfake video impersonations that leverages unnatural patterns in
facial biometrics. We evaluate this technique across a large dataset of
deepfake techniques and impersonations, as well as assess its reliability to
video laundering and its generalization to previously unseen video deepfake
generators.

### [3] [PRISM: Reducing Spurious Implicit Biases in Vision-Language Models with LLM-Guided Embedding Projection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08979)
*Mahdiyar Molahasani,Azadeh Motamedi,Michael Greenspan,Il-Min Kim,Ali Etemad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRISM是一种无需数据和任务无关的方法，用于减少视觉语言模型（如CLIP）中的隐含偏差。它通过生成场景描述和对比式去偏差损失来最小化虚假相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型（VLMs）常因训练数据中的偏差而产生偏斜预测，PRISM旨在无需外部数据或预定义偏差类别的情况下解决这一问题。

Method: PRISM分两阶段：1）用LLM生成包含虚假相关性的场景描述；2）使用对比式去偏差损失学习投影，最小化虚假相关性并保持图像与文本嵌入的对齐。

Result: PRISM在Waterbirds和CelebA数据集上优于现有去偏差方法。

Conclusion: PRISM提供了一种有效且无需外部数据的去偏差解决方案，适用于视觉语言模型。

Abstract: We introduce Projection-based Reduction of Implicit Spurious bias in
vision-language Models (PRISM), a new data-free and task-agnostic solution for
bias mitigation in VLMs like CLIP. VLMs often inherit and amplify biases in
their training data, leading to skewed predictions. PRISM is designed to debias
VLMs without relying on predefined bias categories or additional external data.
It operates in two stages: first, an LLM is prompted with simple class prompts
to generate scene descriptions that contain spurious correlations. Next, PRISM
uses our novel contrastive-style debiasing loss to learn a projection that maps
the embeddings onto a latent space that minimizes spurious correlations while
preserving the alignment between image and text embeddings.Extensive
experiments demonstrate that PRISM outperforms current debiasing methods on the
commonly used Waterbirds and CelebA datasets We make our code public at:

### [4] [Video Inference for Human Mesh Recovery with Vision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08981)
*Hanbyel Cho,Jaesung Ahn,Yooshin Cho,Junmo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合时空和运动学信息的HMR方法HMR-ViT，通过构建时空-运动学特征图像并使用Vision Transformer，显著提升了人体网格恢复的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HMR方法仅利用时空或运动学信息，未能结合两者，限制了性能提升。

Method: 构建时空-运动学特征图像，使用通道重排矩阵优化特征排列，通过Vision Transformer和回归网络推断SMPL参数。

Result: 在3DPW和Human3.6M数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: HMR-ViT通过结合时空和运动学信息，显著提升了HMR任务的性能。

Abstract: Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) from an image is a challenging problem because of
the inherent ambiguity of the task. Existing HMR methods utilized either
temporal information or kinematic relationships to achieve higher accuracy, but
there is no method using both. Hence, we propose "Video Inference for Human
Mesh Recovery with Vision Transformer (HMR-ViT)" that can take into account
both temporal and kinematic information. In HMR-ViT, a Temporal-kinematic
Feature Image is constructed using feature vectors obtained from video frames
by an image encoder. When generating the feature image, we use a Channel
Rearranging Matrix (CRM) so that similar kinematic features could be located
spatially close together. The feature image is then further encoded using
Vision Transformer, and the SMPL pose and shape parameters are finally inferred
using a regression network. Extensive evaluation on the 3DPW and Human3.6M
datasets indicates that our method achieves a competitive performance in HMR.

### [5] [From images to properties: a NeRF-driven framework for granular material parameter inversion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09005)
*Cheng-Hsi Hsiao,Krishna Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合NeRF和MPM的新框架，通过视觉观测推断颗粒材料特性，摩擦角估计误差在2度以内。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在直接测量不可行的情况下，通过视觉观测逆向分析颗粒材料特性。

Method: 生成合成实验数据，利用NeRF重建3D几何，MPM模拟初始化材料点位置，通过贝叶斯优化最小化图像损失估计摩擦角。

Result: 摩擦角估计误差在2度以内。

Conclusion: 该方法为颗粒材料特性表征提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework that integrates Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)
with Material Point Method (MPM) simulation to infer granular material
properties from visual observations. Our approach begins by generating
synthetic experimental data, simulating an plow interacting with sand. The
experiment is rendered into realistic images as the photographic observations.
These observations include multi-view images of the experiment's initial state
and time-sequenced images from two fixed cameras. Using NeRF, we reconstruct
the 3D geometry from the initial multi-view images, leveraging its capability
to synthesize novel viewpoints and capture intricate surface details. The
reconstructed geometry is then used to initialize material point positions for
the MPM simulation, where the friction angle remains unknown. We render images
of the simulation under the same camera setup and compare them to the observed
images. By employing Bayesian optimization, we minimize the image loss to
estimate the best-fitting friction angle. Our results demonstrate that friction
angle can be estimated with an error within 2 degrees, highlighting the
effectiveness of inverse analysis through purely visual observations. This
approach offers a promising solution for characterizing granular materials in
real-world scenarios where direct measurement is impractical or impossible.

### [6] [VISTA: A Visual Analytics Framework to Enhance Foundation Model-Generated Data Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09008)
*Xiwei Xuan,Xiaoqi Wang,Wenbin He,Jorge Piazentin Ono,Liang Gou,Kwan-Liu Ma,Liu Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VISTA是一个视觉分析框架，旨在提高多模态基础模型生成标签的质量，通过结合多阶段数据验证策略和人类专业知识，解决现有方法在数据质量评估上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多关注数据量而非质量，缺乏对多模态基础模型生成标签质量的全面评估，导致下游任务性能受限。

Method: 提出VISTA框架，整合多阶段数据验证策略和人类专业知识，用于识别和修正FM生成标签中的隐藏问题。

Result: 在开放词汇图像分割领域，VISTA通过定量和定性分析证明其有效性，提升了模型性能。

Conclusion: VISTA为多模态模型的数据质量提升提供了一种新方法，结合人类与自动化验证，显著改善了标签质量。

Abstract: The advances in multi-modal foundation models (FMs) (e.g., CLIP and LLaVA)
have facilitated the auto-labeling of large-scale datasets, enhancing model
performance in challenging downstream tasks such as open-vocabulary object
detection and segmentation. However, the quality of FM-generated labels is less
studied as existing approaches focus more on data quantity over quality. This
is because validating large volumes of data without ground truth presents a
considerable challenge in practice. Existing methods typically rely on limited
metrics to identify problematic data, lacking a comprehensive perspective, or
apply human validation to only a small data fraction, failing to address the
full spectrum of potential issues. To overcome these challenges, we introduce
VISTA, a visual analytics framework that improves data quality to enhance the
performance of multi-modal models. Targeting the complex and demanding domain
of open-vocabulary image segmentation, VISTA integrates multi-phased data
validation strategies with human expertise, enabling humans to identify,
understand, and correct hidden issues within FM-generated labels. Through
detailed use cases on two benchmark datasets and expert reviews, we demonstrate
VISTA's effectiveness from both quantitative and qualitative perspectives.

### [8] [Can Contrastive Learning Improve Class-Imbalanced Diffusion Model?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09052)
*Fang Chen,Alex Villa,Gongbo Liang,Xiaoyi Lu,Meng Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出两种对比损失函数，用于提升长尾分布数据中尾部类别的图像多样性，同时保持头部类别的保真度和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长尾分布数据中尾部类别图像合成多样性不足的问题，避免模式崩溃。

Method: 引入无监督InfoNCE损失和MSE损失，通过对比学习和条件-无条件对齐提升尾部类别多样性。

Result: 在多个数据集（如CIFAR10/100-LT等）上优于标准DDPM和其他方法。

Conclusion: 对比学习框架简单有效，显著提升了长尾数据下扩散模型的性能。

Abstract: Training data for class-conditional image synthesis often exhibit a
long-tailed distribution with limited images for tail classes. Such an
imbalance causes mode collapse and reduces the diversity of synthesized images
for tail classes. For class-conditional diffusion models trained on imbalanced
data, we aim to improve the diversity of tail class images without compromising
the fidelity and diversity of head class images. We achieve this by introducing
two deceptively simple but highly effective contrastive loss functions.
Firstly, we employ an unsupervised InfoNCE loss utilizing negative samples to
increase the distance/dissimilarity among synthetic images, particularly for
tail classes. To further enhance the diversity of tail classes, our second loss
is an MSE loss that contrasts class-conditional generation with unconditional
generation at large timesteps. This second loss makes the denoising process
insensitive to class conditions for the initial steps, which enriches tail
classes through knowledge sharing from head classes. Conditional-unconditional
alignment has been shown to enhance the performance of long-tailed GAN. We are
the first to adapt such alignment to diffusion models. We successfully
leveraged contrastive learning for class-imbalanced diffusion models. Our
contrastive learning framework is easy to implement and outperforms standard
DDPM and alternative methods for class-imbalanced diffusion models across
various datasets, including CIFAR10/100-LT, PlacesLT, TinyImageNetLT, and
ImageNetLT.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出无限视频理解（Infinite Video Understanding）作为多媒体研究的新前沿，旨在解决长视频处理的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型和多模态扩展在视频理解方面取得进展，但处理超长视频时仍面临计算、内存和时序一致性等挑战。

Method: 提出将无限视频理解作为研究目标，推动流式架构、持久记忆机制、分层表示和事件中心推理等创新。

Result: 论文未提供具体实验结果，而是提出了未来研究方向。

Conclusion: 无限视频理解是多媒体和AI研究的重要方向，需在架构、表示和评估等方面进行创新。

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal
extensions (MLLMs) have ushered in remarkable progress in video understanding.
However, a fundamental challenge persists: effectively processing and
comprehending video content that extends beyond minutes or hours. While recent
efforts like Video-XL-2 have demonstrated novel architectural solutions for
extreme efficiency, and advancements in positional encoding such as HoPE and
VideoRoPE++ aim to improve spatio-temporal understanding over extensive
contexts, current state-of-the-art models still encounter significant
computational and memory constraints when faced with the sheer volume of visual
tokens from lengthy sequences. Furthermore, maintaining temporal coherence,
tracking complex events, and preserving fine-grained details over extended
periods remain formidable hurdles, despite progress in agentic reasoning
systems like Deep Video Discovery. This position paper posits that a logical,
albeit ambitious, next frontier for multimedia research is Infinite Video
Understanding -- the capability for models to continuously process, understand,
and reason about video data of arbitrary, potentially never-ending duration. We
argue that framing Infinite Video Understanding as a blue-sky research
objective provides a vital north star for the multimedia, and the wider AI,
research communities, driving innovation in areas such as streaming
architectures, persistent memory mechanisms, hierarchical and adaptive
representations, event-centric reasoning, and novel evaluation paradigms.
Drawing inspiration from recent work on long/ultra-long video understanding and
several closely related fields, we outline the core challenges and key research
directions towards achieving this transformative capability.

### [10] [BlindSight: Harnessing Sparsity for Efficient VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09071)
*Tharun Adithya Srikrishnan,Deval Shah,Steven K. Reinhardt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BlindSight通过利用视觉语言模型中的注意力稀疏性，提出了一种无需训练的方法来优化推理，显著减少计算量（FLOPs减少32%-41%），同时保持准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型（VLMs）中视觉数据的加入显著增加了提示长度，导致注意力计算的二次复杂度问题，延长了预填充时间。

Method: 通过分析VLMs中的注意力模式，发现许多层的跨图像注意力稀疏。基于此，提出了BlindSight方法，利用输入模板感知的注意力稀疏掩码优化推理。

Result: 在Qwen2-VL等模型上测试，BlindSight平均减少32%-41%的FLOPs，准确率变化在-2%到+2%之间。

Conclusion: BlindSight是一种高效且无需训练的VLM推理优化方法，显著降低计算成本，同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) enable the joint processing of text and
images. However, the inclusion of vision data significantly expands the prompt
length. Along with the quadratic complexity of the attention computation, this
results in a longer prefill duration. An approach to mitigate this bottleneck
is to leverage the inherent sparsity in the attention computation. In our
analysis of attention patterns in VLMs, we observe that a substantial portion
of layers exhibit minimal cross-image attention, except through attention-sink
tokens per image. These sparse attention patterns fall into distinct
categories: sink-only, document mask and a hybrid document-sink mask. Based on
this, we propose BlindSight: a training-free approach to optimize VLM inference
using a input template-aware attention sparsity mask. We utilize samples from a
dataset to derive a prompt-agnostic sparsity categorization for every attention
head. We evaluate the proposed technique using VLMs such as Qwen2-VL,
Qwen2.5-VL and Gemma-3. BlindSight results in a 32%-41% reduction in FLOPs on
average with -2%-+2% accuracy compared to the original model in most evaluated
multi-image understanding benchmarks.

TL;DR: 该论文综述了定量遥感反演方法从物理模型到数据驱动和基础模型（FM）的演变，比较了不同范式的假设、应用和局限，并展望了下一代FM的发展方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着遥感系统和人工智能的发展，传统物理模型逐渐被数据驱动和FM方法取代，需要系统梳理方法演变并探讨未来发展方向。

Method: 系统回顾了物理模型（如PROSPECT）、机器学习（如深度学习）和FM（如SatMAE）的方法，比较了其假设、应用和局限。

Result: FM在自监督预训练、多模态集成和跨任务适应方面取得进展，但仍面临物理可解释性、领域泛化等挑战。

Conclusion: 未来FM应注重统一建模能力、跨领域泛化和物理可解释性，以推动遥感反演技术的发展。

Abstract: Quantitative remote sensing inversion aims to estimate continuous surface
variables-such as biomass, vegetation indices, and evapotranspiration-from
satellite observations, supporting applications in ecosystem monitoring, carbon
accounting, and land management. With the evolution of remote sensing systems
and artificial intelligence, traditional physics-based paradigms are giving way
to data-driven and foundation model (FM)-based approaches. This paper
systematically reviews the methodological evolution of inversion techniques,
from physical models (e.g., PROSPECT, SCOPE, DART) to machine learning methods
(e.g., deep learning, multimodal fusion), and further to foundation models
(e.g., SatMAE, GFM, mmEarth). We compare the modeling assumptions, application
scenarios, and limitations of each paradigm, with emphasis on recent FM
advances in self-supervised pretraining, multi-modal integration, and
cross-task adaptation. We also highlight persistent challenges in physical
interpretability, domain generalization, limited supervision, and uncertainty
quantification. Finally, we envision the development of next-generation
foundation models for remote sensing inversion, emphasizing unified modeling
capacity, cross-domain generalization, and physical interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索是否可以通过提示冻结的自监督视频模型（仅用于未来帧预测）来提取光流，而无需微调，以解决标签稀缺和合成数据集与真实数据差距的问题。

Method: 基于Counterfactual World Model范式，提出KL-tracing技术，通过注入局部扰动并计算预测分布间的Kullback-Leibler散度来提取光流。

Result: 在TAP-Vid DAVIS和Kubric数据集上，分别实现了16.6%和4.7%的相对性能提升。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过可控生成视频模型的因果提示是一种可扩展且高效的光流提取方法，优于监督或光度损失方法。

Abstract: Extracting optical flow from videos remains a core computer vision problem.
Motivated by the success of large general-purpose models, we ask whether frozen
self-supervised video models trained only for future frame prediction can be
prompted, without fine-tuning, to output flow. Prior work reading out depth or
illumination from video generators required fine-tuning, which is impractical
for flow where labels are scarce and synthetic datasets suffer from a
sim-to-real gap. Inspired by the Counterfactual World Model (CWM) paradigm,
which can obtain point-wise correspondences by injecting a small tracer
perturbation into a next-frame predictor and tracking its propagation, we
extend this idea to generative video models. We explore several popular
architectures and find that successful zero-shot flow extraction in this manner
is aided by three model properties: (1) distributional prediction of future
frames (avoiding blurry or noisy outputs); (2) factorized latents that treat
each spatio-temporal patch independently; and (3) random-access decoding that
can condition on any subset of future pixels. These properties are uniquely
present in the recent Local Random Access Sequence (LRAS) architecture.
Building on LRAS, we propose KL-tracing: a novel test-time procedure that
injects a localized perturbation into the first frame, rolls out the model one
step, and computes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between perturbed and
unperturbed predictive distributions. Without any flow-specific fine-tuning,
our method outperforms state-of-the-art models on real-world TAP-Vid DAVIS
dataset (16.6% relative improvement for endpoint error) and synthetic TAP-Vid
Kubric (4.7% relative improvement). Our results indicate that counterfactual
prompting of controllable generative video models is a scalable and effective
alternative to supervised or photometric-loss approaches for high-quality flow.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器视觉在医疗和自动化电厂等关键领域的应用，理解卷积神经网络的内部机制及其推理原因变得至关重要。

Method: MI CAM利用输入图像与特征图之间的互信息对每个特征图进行加权，通过线性组合权重和激活图生成最终结果，并通过反事实分析验证因果解释。

Result: MI CAM在视觉性能和模型推理的无偏解释方面表现优异，与现有方法相当，部分指标更优。

Conclusion: MI CAM是一种有效的视觉解释方法，能够提供高质量的无偏推理解释。

Abstract: With the intervention of machine vision in our crucial day to day necessities
including healthcare and automated power plants, attention has been drawn to
the internal mechanisms of convolutional neural networks, and the reason why
the network provides specific inferences. This paper proposes a novel post-hoc
visual explanation method called MI CAM based on activation mapping. Differing
from previous class activation mapping based approaches, MI CAM produces
saliency visualizations by weighing each feature map through its mutual
information with the input image and the final result is generated by a linear
combination of weights and activation maps. It also adheres to producing causal
interpretations as validated with the help of counterfactual analysis. We aim
to exhibit the visual performance and unbiased justifications for the model
inferencing procedure achieved by MI CAM. Our approach works at par with all
state-of-the-art methods but particularly outperforms some in terms of
qualitative and quantitative measures. The implementation of proposed method
can be found on https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MI-CAM-4D27

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RadEyeVideo通过整合放射科医生的眼动视频序列，显著提升了大型视觉语言模型在胸部X光分析和报告生成中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽略了眼动的顺序信息，而RadEyeVideo旨在利用时空动态提升模型性能。

Method: 提出RadEyeVideo方法，将眼动数据作为视频序列输入，结合三种支持视频输入的大型视觉语言模型进行评估。

Result: 模型性能在报告生成任务中提升24.6%，在诊断任务中平均提升15.2%，甚至超越专业医学模型。

Conclusion: RadEyeVideo展示了专家知识与通用模型的结合潜力，为医学图像分析提供了可扩展的人本方法。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated promising performance
in chest X-ray (CXR) analysis. To enhance human-computer interaction, several
studies have incorporated radiologists' eye gaze, typically through heatmaps or
textual prompts. However, these methods often overlook the sequential order of
eye movements, which could provide valuable insights by highlighting both the
areas of interest and the order in which they are examined. In this work, we
propose a novel approach called RadEyeVideo that integrates radiologists'
eye-fixation data as a video sequence, capturing both the temporal and spatial
dynamics of their gaze. We evaluate this method in CXR report generation and
disease diagnosis using three general-domain, open-source LVLMs with video
input capabilities. When prompted with eye-gaze videos, model performance
improves by up to 24.6% in the report generation task and on average 15.2% for
both tasks using scaled evaluation metrics. Notably, RadEyeVideo enhanced an
open-domain LVLM model, LLaVA-OneVision, to surpass task-specific medical LVLMs
such as MAIRA-2 and CheXagent, trained on large Chest X-ray data. This work
highlights that domain expert's knowledge (eye-gaze information in this case),
when effectively integrated with LVLMs, can significantly enhance
general-domain models' capabilities in clinical tasks. RadEyeVideo is a step
toward a scalable human-centered approach of utilizing LVLMs in medical image
analytics.

Abstract: Diffusion-based models, widely used in text-to-image generation, have proven
effective in 2D representation learning. Recently, this framework has been
extended to 3D self-supervised learning by constructing a conditional point
generator for enhancing 3D representations. However, its performance remains
constrained by the 3D diffusion model, which is trained on the available 3D
datasets with limited size. We hypothesize that the robust capabilities of
text-to-image diffusion models, particularly Stable Diffusion (SD), which is
trained on large-scale datasets, can help overcome these limitations. To
investigate this hypothesis, we propose PointSD, a framework that leverages the
SD model for 3D self-supervised learning. By replacing the SD model's text
encoder with a 3D encoder, we train a point-to-image diffusion model that
allows point clouds to guide the denoising of rendered noisy images. With the
trained point-to-image diffusion model, we use noise-free images as the input
and point clouds as the condition to extract SD features. Next, we train a 3D
backbone by aligning its features with these SD features, thereby facilitating
direct semantic learning. Comprehensive experiments on downstream point cloud
tasks and ablation studies demonstrate that the SD model can enhance point
cloud self-supervised learning. Code is publicly available at

*Maoxiao Ye,Xinfeng Ye,Mano Manoharan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合自回归和扩散模型的混合方法，用于手语生成（SLP），解决了传统方法的误差累积和实时性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自回归方法在推理阶段存在误差累积问题，而扩散模型因迭代性质难以实时应用。

Method: 采用混合模型结合自回归和扩散模型的优势，设计多尺度姿态表示模块和置信感知因果注意力机制。

Result: 在PHOENIX14T和How2Sign数据集上验证了方法在生成质量和实时效率上的有效性。

Conclusion: 混合方法显著提升了手语生成的准确性和实时性。

Abstract: Earlier Sign Language Production (SLP) models typically relied on
autoregressive methods that generate output tokens one by one, which inherently
provide temporal alignment. Although techniques like Teacher Forcing can
prevent model collapse during training, they still cannot solve the problem of
error accumulation during inference, since ground truth is unavailable at that
stage. In contrast, more recent approaches based on diffusion models leverage
step-by-step denoising to enable high-quality generation. However, the
iterative nature of these models and the requirement to denoise entire
sequences limit their applicability in real-time tasks like SLP. To address it,
we apply a hybrid approach combining autoregressive and diffusion models to SLP
for the first time, leveraging the strengths of both models in sequential
dependency modeling and output refinement. To capture fine-grained body
movements, we design a Multi-Scale Pose Representation module that separately
extracts detailed features from distinct articulators and integrates them via a
Multi-Scale Fusion module. Furthermore, we introduce a Confidence-Aware Causal
Attention mechanism that utilizes joint-level confidence scores to dynamically
guide the pose generation process, improving accuracy and robustness. Extensive
experiments on the PHOENIX14T and How2Sign datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method in both generation quality and real-time streaming
efficiency.

Conclusion: RoHOI基准和SAMPL策略为提升HOI检测的鲁棒性提供了有效工具，相关资源将公开。

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection is crucial for robot-human
assistance, enabling context-aware support. However, models trained on clean
datasets degrade in real-world conditions due to unforeseen corruptions,
leading to inaccurate prediction. To address this, we introduce the first
robustness benchmark for HOI detection, evaluating model resilience under
diverse challenges. Despite advances, current models struggle with
environmental variability, occlusion, and noise. Our benchmark, RoHOI, includes
20 corruption types based on HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets and a new
robustness-focused metric. We systematically analyze existing models in the
related field, revealing significant performance drops under corruptions. To
improve robustness, we propose a Semantic-Aware Masking-based Progressive
Learning (SAMPL) strategy to guide the model to be optimized based on holistic
and partial cues, dynamically adjusting the model's optimization to enhance
robust feature learning. Extensive experiments show our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, setting a new standard for robust HOI detection.
Benchmarks, datasets, and code will be made publicly available at

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法，无需额外回放数据。

Conclusion: 模态间隙是持续学习中的关键因素，MG-CLIP为CLIP模型的持续学习提供了新视角。

Abstract: Continual learning aims to enable models to learn sequentially from
continuously incoming data while retaining performance on previously learned
tasks. With the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-trained model (CLIP) exhibiting
strong capabilities across various downstream tasks, there has been growing
interest in leveraging CLIP for continual learning in such scenarios. Most
existing works overlook the inherent modality gap in CLIP, a key factor in its
generalization and adaptability. In this paper, we analyze the variations in
the modality gap during the fine-tuning of vision-language pre-trained models.
Our observations reveal that the modality gap effectively reflects the extent
to which pre-trained knowledge is preserved. Based on these insights, we
propose a simple yet effective method, MG-CLIP, that improves CLIP's
performance in class-incremental learning. Our approach leverages modality gap
preservation to mitigate forgetting and modality gap compensation to enhance
the capacity for new data, introducing a novel modality-gap-based perspective
for continual learning. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches without requiring
additional replay data. Our code is available at

Conclusion: SnapMoGen和MoMask++显著提升了文本到运动生成的细粒度控制和长期运动生成能力。

Abstract: Text-to-motion generation has experienced remarkable progress in recent
years. However, current approaches remain limited to synthesizing motion from
short or general text prompts, primarily due to dataset constraints. This
limitation undermines fine-grained controllability and generalization to unseen
prompts. In this paper, we introduce SnapMoGen, a new text-motion dataset
featuring high-quality motion capture data paired with accurate, expressive
textual annotations. The dataset comprises 20K motion clips totaling 44 hours,
accompanied by 122K detailed textual descriptions averaging 48 words per
description (vs. 12 words of HumanML3D). Importantly, these motion clips
preserve original temporal continuity as they were in long sequences,
facilitating research in long-term motion generation and blending. We also
improve upon previous generative masked modeling approaches. Our model,
MoMask++, transforms motion into multi-scale token sequences that better
exploit the token capacity, and learns to generate all tokens using a single
generative masked transformer. MoMask++ achieves state-of-the-art performance
on both HumanML3D and SnapMoGen benchmarks. Additionally, we demonstrate the
ability to process casual user prompts by employing an LLM to reformat inputs
to align with the expressivity and narration style of SnapMoGen. Project

TL;DR: PoseLLM提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的姿态估计框架，通过非线性MLP视觉-语言连接器提升定位精度，优于现有方法LocLLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统姿态估计方法依赖关键点先验，泛化能力有限；LocLLM的线性投影器无法捕捉复杂空间-文本交互。

Method: 用非线性MLP替换线性投影器，实现跨模态特征分层转换，增强视觉块与文本描述的融合。

Result: 在COCO验证集上达到77.8 AP，优于LocLLM（+0.4 AP），并在Human-Art和MPII上保持强零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: 非线性连接器显著提升定位精度且不牺牲泛化能力，推动了语言引导姿态估计的先进水平。

Abstract: Human pose estimation traditionally relies on architectures that encode
keypoint priors, limiting their generalization to novel poses or unseen
keypoints. Recent language-guided approaches like LocLLM reformulate keypoint
localization as a vision-language task, enabling zero-shot generalization
through textual descriptions. However, LocLLM's linear projector fails to
capture complex spatial-textual interactions critical for high-precision
localization. To address this, we propose PoseLLM, the first Large Language
Model (LLM)-based pose estimation framework that replaces the linear projector
with a nonlinear MLP vision-language connector. This lightweight two-layer MLP
with GELU activation enables hierarchical cross-modal feature transformation,
enhancing the fusion of visual patches and textual keypoint descriptions.
Trained exclusively on COCO data, PoseLLM achieves 77.8 AP on the COCO
validation set, outperforming LocLLM by +0.4 AP, while maintaining strong
zero-shot generalization on Human-Art and MPII. Our work demonstrates that a
simple yet powerful nonlinear connector significantly boosts localization
accuracy without sacrificing generalization, advancing the state-of-the-art in
language-guided pose estimation. Code is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为$I^{2}$-World的高效4D占用预测框架，通过解耦场景标记化实现动态表达和计算效率的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动驾驶系统中3D场景演化的预测和生成问题，特别是复杂3D场景的高效标记化挑战。

Method: 采用双标记器设计（场景内和场景间），结合多尺度残差量化和残差聚合策略，并采用编码器-解码器架构。

Result: 在4D占用预测任务中，性能优于现有方法25.1%的mIoU和36.9%的IoU，同时计算高效（2.9GB内存，37.0FPS实时推理）。

Conclusion: $I^{2}$-World在动态场景预测中表现出色，为自动驾驶系统的角落案例提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Forecasting the evolution of 3D scenes and generating unseen scenarios via
occupancy-based world models offers substantial potential for addressing corner
cases in autonomous driving systems. While tokenization has revolutionized
image and video generation, efficiently tokenizing complex 3D scenes remains a
critical challenge for 3D world models. To address this, we propose
$I^{2}$-World, an efficient framework for 4D occupancy forecasting. Our method
decouples scene tokenization into intra-scene and inter-scene tokenizers. The
intra-scene tokenizer employs a multi-scale residual quantization strategy to
hierarchically compress 3D scenes while preserving spatial details. The
inter-scene tokenizer residually aggregates temporal dependencies across
timesteps. This dual design preserves the compactness of 3D tokenizers while
retaining the dynamic expressiveness of 4D tokenizers. Unlike decoder-only
GPT-style autoregressive models, $I^{2}$-World adopts an encoder-decoder
architecture. The encoder aggregates spatial context from the current scene and
predicts a transformation matrix to enable high-level control over scene
generation. The decoder, conditioned on this matrix and historical tokens,
ensures temporal consistency during generation. Experiments demonstrate that
$I^{2}$-World achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing
methods by 25.1\% in mIoU and 36.9\% in IoU for 4D occupancy forecasting while
exhibiting exceptional computational efficiency: it requires merely 2.9 GB of
training memory and achieves real-time inference at 37.0 FPS. Our code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如Delta Denoising Score在稳定性、空间控制和编辑强度上存在问题，主要依赖复杂辅助结构导致优化信号冲突。

Method: SSD通过锚定单一分类器到源提示，利用Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG)实现跨提示对齐，并引入空文本分支稳定优化。

Result: SSD在2D和3D编辑任务（如NeRF和风格转换）中取得最佳效果，收敛更快且复杂度更低。

Conclusion: SSD提供了一种高效稳定的文本引导编辑解决方案，保持了内容结构并增强了编辑强度。

Abstract: Text-guided image and 3D editing have advanced with diffusion-based models,
yet methods like Delta Denoising Score often struggle with stability, spatial
control, and editing strength. These limitations stem from reliance on complex
auxiliary structures, which introduce conflicting optimization signals and
restrict precise, localized edits. We introduce Stable Score Distillation
(SSD), a streamlined framework that enhances stability and alignment in the
editing process by anchoring a single classifier to the source prompt.
Specifically, SSD utilizes Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) equation to achieves
cross-prompt alignment, and introduces a constant term null-text branch to
stabilize the optimization process. This approach preserves the original
content's structure and ensures that editing trajectories are closely aligned
with the source prompt, enabling smooth, prompt-specific modifications while
maintaining coherence in surrounding regions. Additionally, SSD incorporates a
prompt enhancement branch to boost editing strength, particularly for style
transformations. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results in 2D and 3D
editing tasks, including NeRF and text-driven style edits, with faster
convergence and reduced complexity, providing a robust and efficient solution
for text-guided editing.

Result: 实验表明，LGSP-Prompt在多个FSCIL基准测试中达到最先进性能，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LGSP-Prompt通过空间提示池有效解决了FSCIL中的性能退化问题，为增量学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) faces dual challenges of data
scarcity and incremental learning in real-world scenarios. While pool-based
prompting methods have demonstrated success in traditional incremental
learning, their effectiveness in FSCIL settings remains unexplored. This paper
presents the first study of current prompt pool methods in FSCIL tasks,
revealing an unanticipated performance degradation in incremental sessions.
Through comprehensive analysis, we identify that this phenomenon stems from
token-dimension saturation: with limited data, excessive prompts compete for
task-relevant information, leading to model overfitting. Based on this finding,
we propose LGSP-Prompt (Local-Global Spatial Prompting), which innovatively
shifts pool-based prompt learning from the token dimension to the spatial
dimension. LGSP-Prompt generates spatial prompts by synergistically combining
local spatial features and global frequency-domain representations to highlight
key patterns in input images. We construct two spatial prompt pools enabling
dynamic prompt selection to maintain acquired knowledge while effectively
learning novel sessions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple FSCIL benchmarks, showing
significant advantages in both base knowledge preservation and incremental
learning. Our implementation is available at

Conclusion: MCA-LLaVA通过缓解图像对齐偏差，显著提升了多模态对齐效果。

Abstract: Hallucinations pose a significant challenge in Large Vision Language Models
(LVLMs), with misalignment between multimodal features identified as a key
contributing factor. This paper reveals the negative impact of the long-term
decay in Rotary Position Encoding (RoPE), used for positional modeling in
LVLMs, on multimodal alignment. Concretely, under long-term decay, instruction
tokens exhibit uneven perception of image tokens located at different positions
within the two-dimensional space: prioritizing image tokens from the
bottom-right region since in the one-dimensional sequence, these tokens are
positionally closer to the instruction tokens. This biased perception leads to
insufficient image-instruction interaction and suboptimal multimodal alignment.
We refer to this phenomenon as image alignment bias. To enhance instruction's
perception of image tokens at different spatial locations, we propose
MCA-LLaVA, based on Manhattan distance, which extends the long-term decay to a
two-dimensional, multi-directional spatial decay. MCA-LLaVA integrates the
one-dimensional sequence order and two-dimensional spatial position of image
tokens for positional modeling, mitigating hallucinations by alleviating image
alignment bias. Experimental results of MCA-LLaVA across various hallucination
and general benchmarks demonstrate its effectiveness and generality. The code

Result: 在ASPIRe和AeroEye-v1.0数据集上的实验表明，THYME优于现有方法，提升了场景理解能力。

Conclusion: THYME方法有效解决了动态场景图生成的挑战，适用于地面和空中场景。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of video in applications such as autonomous driving,
surveillance, and sports analytics necessitates robust methods for dynamic
scene understanding. Despite advances in static scene graph generation and
early attempts at video scene graph generation, previous methods often suffer
from fragmented representations, failing to capture fine-grained spatial
details and long-range temporal dependencies simultaneously. To address these
limitations, we introduce the Temporal Hierarchical Cyclic Scene Graph (THYME)
approach, which synergistically integrates hierarchical feature aggregation
with cyclic temporal refinement to address these limitations. In particular,
THYME effectively models multi-scale spatial context and enforces temporal
consistency across frames, yielding more accurate and coherent scene graphs. In
addition, we present AeroEye-v1.0, a novel aerial video dataset enriched with
five types of interactivity that overcome the constraints of existing datasets
and provide a comprehensive benchmark for dynamic scene graph generation.
Empirically, extensive experiments on ASPIRe and AeroEye-v1.0 demonstrate that
the proposed THYME approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, offering
improved scene understanding in ground-view and aerial scenarios.

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs) have prompted the
development of multi-modal medical assistant systems. Despite this progress,
current models still have inherent probabilistic uncertainties, often producing
erroneous or unverified responses-an issue with serious implications in medical
applications. Existing methods aim to enhance the performance of Medical Vision
Language Model (MedVLM) by adjusting model structure, fine-tuning with
high-quality data, or through preference fine-tuning. However, these
training-dependent strategies are costly and still lack sufficient alignment
with clinical expertise. To address these issues, we propose an
expert-in-the-loop framework named Expert-Controlled Classifier-Free Guidance
(Expert-CFG) to align MedVLM with clinical expertise without additional
training. This framework introduces an uncertainty estimation strategy to
identify unreliable outputs. It then retrieves relevant references to assist
experts in highlighting key terms and applies classifier-free guidance to
refine the token embeddings of MedVLM, ensuring that the adjusted outputs are
correct and align with expert highlights. Evaluations across three medical
visual question answering benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed Expert-CFG,
with 4.2B parameters and limited expert annotations, outperforms
state-of-the-art models with 13B parameters. The results demonstrate the
feasibility of deploying such a system in resource-limited settings for

Conclusion: S3AD算法和KITTI-AR数据集为3D异常检测提供了有效解决方案，增强了模型在开放场景中的适应性。

Abstract: 3D detection technology is widely used in the field of autonomous driving,
with its application scenarios gradually expanding from enclosed highways to
open conventional roads. For rare anomaly categories that appear on the road,
3D detection models trained on closed sets often misdetect or fail to detect
anomaly objects. To address this risk, it is necessary to enhance the
generalization ability of 3D detection models for targets of arbitrary shapes
and to possess the capability to filter out anomalies. The generalization of 3D
detection is limited by two factors: the coupled training of 2D and 3D, and the
insufficient diversity in the scale distribution of training samples. This
paper proposes a Stereo-based 3D Anomaly object Detection (S3AD) algorithm,
which decouples the training strategy of 3D and 2D to release the
generalization ability for arbitrary 3D foreground detection, and proposes an
anomaly scoring algorithm based on foreground confidence prediction, achieving
target-level anomaly scoring. In order to further verify and enhance the
generalization of anomaly detection, we use a 3D rendering method to synthesize
two augmented reality binocular stereo 3D detection datasets which named
KITTI-AR. KITTI-AR extends upon KITTI by adding 97 new categories, totaling 6k
pairs of stereo images. The KITTI-AR-ExD subset includes 39 common categories
as extra training data to address the sparse sample distribution issue.
Additionally, 58 rare categories form the KITTI-AR-OoD subset, which are not
used in training to simulate zero-shot scenarios in real-world settings, solely
for evaluating 3D anomaly detection. Finally, the performance of the algorithm
and the dataset is verified in the experiments. (Code and dataset can be

*Jingguo Liu,Han Yu,Shigang Li,Jianfeng Li*

TL;DR: 提出一种新颖的球形采样方法，用于全景图像，直接利用现有的二维预训练模型，减少失真并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏大规模全景图像数据集，现有任务依赖二维预训练模型，但这些模型无法处理全景图像的失真和不连续性，影响性能。

Method: 采用球形离散采样方法，基于预训练模型的权重，减少失真并获得良好的初始训练值；将该方法应用于全景图像分割，利用球形模型特征作为特定通道注意力的掩码。

Result: 在常用室内数据集Stanford2D3D上取得了良好效果。

Conclusion: 提出的球形采样方法有效解决了全景图像处理中的失真问题，并提升了任务性能。

Abstract: Due to the current lack of large-scale datasets at the million-scale level,
tasks involving panoramic images predominantly rely on existing two-dimensional
pre-trained image benchmark models as backbone networks. However, these
networks are not equipped to recognize the distortions and discontinuities
inherent in panoramic images, which adversely affects their performance in such
tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel spherical sampling method for
panoramic images that enables the direct utilization of existing pre-trained
models developed for two-dimensional images. Our method employs spherical
discrete sampling based on the weights of the pre-trained models, effectively
mitigating distortions while achieving favorable initial training values.
Additionally, we apply the proposed sampling method to panoramic image
segmentation, utilizing features obtained from the spherical model as masks for
specific channel attentions, which yields commendable results on commonly used
indoor datasets, Stanford2D3D.

### [31] [Online Long-term Point Tracking in the Foundation Model Era](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09217)
*Görkay Aydemir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种在线点跟踪方法Track-On，利用视觉基础模型和Transformer架构，实现了无需未来帧信息的长时跟踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景需要在线预测（仅使用当前和过去帧），而现有方法多为离线设置。视觉基础模型虽能提供几何表示，但缺乏时序推理能力。

Method: 提出Track-On，基于Transformer的模型，将每个跟踪点作为查询，逐帧处理视频。

Result: 在七个公开基准测试中达到新最优性能。

Conclusion: Track-On证明了无需未来信息的长时点跟踪的可行性。

Abstract: Point tracking aims to identify the same physical point across video frames
and serves as a geometry-aware representation of motion. This representation
supports a wide range of applications, from robotics to augmented reality, by
enabling accurate modeling of dynamic environments. Most existing long-term
tracking approaches operate in an offline setting, where future frames are
available to refine predictions and recover from occlusions. However,
real-world scenarios often demand online predictions: the model must operate
causally, using only current and past frames. This constraint is critical in
streaming video and embodied AI, where decisions must be made immediately based
on past observations. Under such constraints, viewpoint invariance becomes
essential. Visual foundation models, trained on diverse large-scale datasets,
offer the potential for robust geometric representations. While they lack
temporal reasoning on their own, they can be integrated into tracking pipelines
to enrich spatial features. In this thesis, we address the problem of long-term
point tracking in an online setting, where frames are processed sequentially
without access to future information or sliding windows. We begin by evaluating
the suitability of visual foundation models for this task and find that they
can serve as useful initializations and be integrated into tracking pipelines.
However, to enable long-term tracking in an online setting, a dedicated design
is still required. In particular, maintaining coherence over time in this
causal regime requires memory to propagate appearance and context across
frames. To address this, we introduce Track-On, a transformer-based model that
treats each tracked point as a query and processes video frames one at a time.
Track-On sets a new state of the art across seven public benchmarks,
demonstrating the feasibility of long-term tracking without future access.

*Behraj Khan,Tahir Syed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StaRFM是一个统一框架，通过Fisher信息惩罚（FIP）和置信度对齐惩罚（CMP）解决基础模型在计算机视觉和医学影像中的分布偏移和置信度失准问题，提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型（如CLIP和SAM）在低样本迁移学习中表现出色，但面临训练与测试数据分布偏移和置信度失准的挑战，现有解决方案多为领域特定。

Method: 提出StaRFM框架，包括FIP（用于减少嵌入中的协变量偏移）和CMP（用于校准分割任务中的不确定性），并通过理论分析验证其有效性。

Result: 在19个视觉数据集和医学分割任务中，StaRFM显著提升性能（如准确率+3.5%，ECE降低28%，DSC达84.7%），并减少跨域性能差距40%。

Conclusion: StaRFM是一个即插即用的统一框架，可无缝集成到基础模型中，解决分布偏移和置信度失准问题。

Abstract: Foundation models like CLIP and SAM have transformed computer vision and
medical imaging via low-shot transfer learning. However, deployment of these
models hindered by two key challenges: \textit{distribution shift} between
training and test data, and \textit{confidence misalignment} that leads to
overconfident incorrect predictions. These issues manifest differently in
vision-language classification and medical segmentation tasks, yet existing
solutions remain domain-specific. We propose \textit{StaRFM}, a unified
framework addressing both challenges. It introduces a Fisher information
penalty (FIP), extended to 3D medical data via patch-wise regularization, to
reduce covariate shift in CLIP and SAM embeddings. Additionally, a confidence
misalignment penalty (CMP), reformulated for voxel-level predictions,
calibrates uncertainty in segmentation tasks. We theoretically derive PAC-Bayes
bounds showing FIP controls generalization via the Fisher-Rao norm, while CMP
minimizes calibration error through Brier score optimization. StaRFM shows
consistent performance like \texttt{+}3.5\% accuracy and 28\% lower ECE on 19
vision datasets (e.g., ImageNet, Office-Home), 84.7\% DSC and 4.8mm HD95 in
medical segmentation (e.g., BraTS, ATLAS), and 40\% lower cross-domain
performance gap compared to prior benchmarking methods. The framework is
plug-and-play, requiring minimal architectural changes for seamless integration
with foundation models. Code and models will be released at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于生成先验的方法，利用Stable Diffusion从单视角的自我中心图像重建可动画的虚拟形象，解决了遮挡和身体比例失真的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自我中心视角方法在重建人体外观时存在遮挡和比例失真的问题，且缺乏基于生成先验的方法。本文旨在通过生成模型减少训练负担并提高泛化能力。

Method: 基于Stable Diffusion和ControlNet，提出了一种从遮挡的俯视图像生成真实正面视图的流程，并将其输入到图像到运动模型中。

Result: 该方法能够从单张俯视自我中心图像生成可动画的虚拟形象，减少了训练依赖并提高了泛化性。

Conclusion: 该方法为更易用和通用的数字远程呈现系统提供了可能。

Abstract: An ideal digital telepresence experience requires accurate replication of a
person's body, clothing, and movements. To capture and transfer these movements
into virtual reality, the egocentric (first-person) perspective can be adopted,
which enables the use of a portable and cost-effective device without
front-view cameras. However, this viewpoint introduces challenges such as
occlusions and distorted body proportions.
  There are few works reconstructing human appearance from egocentric views,
and none use a generative prior-based approach. Some methods create avatars
from a single egocentric image during inference, but still rely on multi-view
datasets during training. To our knowledge, this is the first study using a
generative backbone to reconstruct animatable avatars from egocentric inputs.
Based on Stable Diffusion, our method reduces training burden and improves
generalizability.
  Inspired by methods such as SiTH and MagicMan, which perform 360-degree
reconstruction from a frontal image, we introduce a pipeline that generates
realistic frontal views from occluded top-down images using ControlNet and a
Stable Diffusion backbone.
  Our goal is to convert a single top-down egocentric image into a realistic
frontal representation and feed it into an image-to-motion model. This enables
generation of avatar motions from minimal input, paving the way for more
accessible and generalizable telepresence systems.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在准确性、鲁棒性和与人类判断的一致性上优于基线。

Conclusion: 为计算创造力和艺术教育提供了新见解。

Abstract: Artistic image assessment has become a prominent research area in computer
vision. In recent years, the field has witnessed a proliferation of datasets
and methods designed to evaluate the aesthetic quality of paintings. However,
most existing approaches focus solely on static final images, overlooking the
dynamic and multi-stage nature of the artistic painting process. To address
this gap, we propose a novel framework for human-aligned assessment of painting
processes. Specifically, we introduce the Painting Process Assessment Dataset
(PPAD), the first large-scale dataset comprising real and synthetic painting
process images, annotated by domain experts across eight detailed attributes.
Furthermore, we present PPJudge (Painting Process Judge), a Transformer-based
model enhanced with temporally-aware positional encoding and a heterogeneous
mixture-of-experts architecture, enabling effective assessment of the painting
process. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
baselines in accuracy, robustness, and alignment with human judgment, offering
new insights into computational creativity and art education.

TL;DR: AGCD-Net提出了一种注意力引导的上下文去偏模型，通过混合ConvNeXt和因果干预模块解决情感识别中的上下文偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统情感识别方法存在上下文偏差问题，例如将背景（如花园）与情感标签（如快乐）虚假关联，影响了模型的鲁棒性。

Method: AGCD-Net结合了混合ConvNeXt（集成空间变换网络和Squeeze-and-Excitation层）和注意力引导的因果干预模块（AG-CIM），通过扰动上下文特征和注意力驱动修正来消除偏差。

Conclusion: AGCD-Net通过注意力引导和因果干预有效减少了上下文偏差，提升了情感识别的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Context-aware emotion recognition (CAER) enhances affective computing in
real-world scenarios, but traditional methods often suffer from context
bias-spurious correlation between background context and emotion labels (e.g.
associating ``garden'' with ``happy''). In this paper, we propose
\textbf{AGCD-Net}, an Attention Guided Context Debiasing model that introduces
\textit{Hybrid ConvNeXt}, a novel convolutional encoder that extends the
ConvNeXt backbone by integrating Spatial Transformer Network and
Squeeze-and-Excitation layers for enhanced feature recalibration. At the core
of AGCD-Net is the Attention Guided - Causal Intervention Module (AG-CIM),
which applies causal theory, perturbs context features, isolates spurious
correlations, and performs an attention-driven correction guided by face
features to mitigate context bias. Experimental results on the CAER-S dataset
demonstrate the effectiveness of AGCD-Net, achieving state-of-the-art
performance and highlighting the importance of causal debiasing for robust
emotion recognition in complex settings.

TL;DR: AAHR框架通过动态聚类原型对比学习和多模态关系矩阵，解决了图像-文本匹配中的语义模糊和高阶关联问题，显著提升了匹配性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理高阶关联和语义模糊时表现不佳，尤其是对软正负样本的区分能力有限。

Method: AAHR结合动态聚类原型对比学习、全局和局部特征提取、自适应聚合网络、GNN增强语义交互以及动量对比学习。

Result: 在Flickr30K、MSCOCO和ECCV Caption数据集上，AAHR优于现有方法，提高了匹配准确性和效率。

Conclusion: AAHR通过综合策略有效解决了语义模糊和高阶关联问题，为图像-文本匹配提供了新思路。

Abstract: Image-text matching is crucial for bridging the semantic gap between computer
vision and natural language processing. However, existing methods still face
challenges in handling high-order associations and semantic ambiguities among
similar instances. These ambiguities arise from subtle differences between soft
positive samples (semantically similar but incorrectly labeled) and soft
negative samples (locally matched but globally inconsistent), creating matching
uncertainties. Furthermore, current methods fail to fully utilize the
neighborhood relationships among semantically similar instances within training
batches, limiting the model's ability to learn high-order shared knowledge.
This paper proposes the Ambiguity-Aware and High-order Relation learning
framework (AAHR) to address these issues. AAHR constructs a unified
representation space through dynamic clustering prototype contrastive learning,
effectively mitigating the soft positive sample problem. The framework
introduces global and local feature extraction mechanisms and an adaptive
aggregation network, significantly enhancing full-grained semantic
understanding capabilities. Additionally, AAHR employs intra-modal and
inter-modal correlation matrices to investigate neighborhood relationships
among sample instances thoroughly. It incorporates GNN to enhance semantic
interactions between instances. Furthermore, AAHR integrates momentum
contrastive learning to expand the negative sample set. These combined
strategies significantly improve the model's ability to discriminate between
features. Experimental results demonstrate that AAHR outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods on Flickr30K, MSCOCO, and ECCV Caption datasets,
considerably improving the accuracy and efficiency of image-text matching. The
code and model checkpoints for this research are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有无注释手语翻译方法模型复杂、计算需求高的问题，提升在大规模数据集上的可扩展性。

Method: 采用分段感知的视觉标记化框架，将连续视频转换为离散标记，并结合对比对齐目标和双重监督机制。

Result: 在PHOENIX14T基准测试中表现优于现有方法，序列长度减少50%，内存使用降低2.67倍。

Conclusion: 该方法在性能和可扩展性上均有显著提升，验证了标记化和对齐策略的有效性。

Abstract: Gloss-free Sign Language Translation (SLT) has advanced rapidly, achieving
strong performances without relying on gloss annotations. However, these gains
have often come with increased model complexity and high computational demands,
raising concerns about scalability, especially as large-scale sign language
datasets become more common. We propose a segment-aware visual tokenization
framework that leverages sign segmentation to convert continuous video into
discrete, sign-informed visual tokens. This reduces input sequence length by up
to 50% compared to prior methods, resulting in up to 2.67x lower memory usage
and better scalability on larger datasets. To bridge the visual and linguistic
modalities, we introduce a token-to-token contrastive alignment objective,
along with a dual-level supervision that aligns both language embeddings and
intermediate hidden states. This improves fine-grained cross-modal alignment
without relying on gloss-level supervision. Our approach notably exceeds the
performance of state-of-the-art methods on the PHOENIX14T benchmark, while
significantly reducing sequence length. Further experiments also demonstrate
our improved performance over prior work under comparable sequence-lengths,
validating the potential of our tokenization and alignment strategies.

Abstract: Recently, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have demonstrated rich potential in
computer vision domain due to their high biological plausibility, event-driven
characteristic and energy-saving efficiency. Still, limited annotated
event-based datasets and immature SNN architectures result in their performance
inferior to that of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). To enhance the
performance of SNNs on their optimal data format, DVS data, we explore using
RGB data and well-performing ANNs to implement knowledge distillation. In this
case, solving cross-modality and cross-architecture challenges is necessary. In
this paper, we propose cross knowledge distillation (CKD), which not only
leverages semantic similarity and sliding replacement to mitigate the
cross-modality challenge, but also uses an indirect phased knowledge
distillation to mitigate the cross-architecture challenge. We validated our
method on main-stream neuromorphic datasets, including N-Caltech101 and
CEP-DVS. The experimental results show that our method outperforms current
State-of-the-Art methods. The code will be available at

Motivation: MLLMs在医疗领域的应用受到两个关键限制：对提示设计的敏感性和高置信度错误回答。Prompt4Trust旨在解决这些问题，提升模型的可信度。

Result: 在PMC-VQA基准测试中达到最先进的医疗视觉问答性能，并展示了零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: Prompt4Trust展示了自动化提示工程在提升MLLMs可信度方面的潜力，特别是在安全关键领域。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold considerable promise for
applications in healthcare. However, their deployment in safety-critical
settings is hindered by two key limitations: (i) sensitivity to prompt design,
and (ii) a tendency to generate incorrect responses with high confidence. As
clinicians may rely on a model's stated confidence to gauge the reliability of
its predictions, it is especially important that when a model expresses high
confidence, it is also highly accurate. We introduce Prompt4Trust, the first
reinforcement learning (RL) framework for prompt augmentation targeting
confidence calibration in MLLMs. A lightweight LLM is trained to produce
context-aware auxiliary prompts that guide a downstream task MLLM to generate
responses in which the expressed confidence more accurately reflects predictive
accuracy. Unlike conventional calibration techniques, Prompt4Trust specifically
prioritizes aspects of calibration most critical for safe and trustworthy
clinical decision-making. Beyond improvements driven by this clinically
motivated calibration objective, our proposed method also improves task
accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art medical visual question answering (VQA)
performance on the PMC-VQA benchmark, which is composed of multiple-choice
questions spanning diverse medical imaging modalities. Moreover, our framework
trained with a small downstream task MLLM showed promising zero-shot
generalization to larger MLLMs in our experiments, suggesting the potential for
scalable calibration without the associated computational costs. This work
demonstrates the potential of automated yet human-aligned prompt engineering
for improving the the trustworthiness of MLLMs in safety critical settings. Our

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效缓解了模糊核初始化的敏感性，提升了BMD性能，并扩展至非均匀运动去模糊任务。

Abstract: Deep prior-based approaches have demonstrated remarkable success in blind
motion deblurring (BMD) recently. These methods, however, are often limited by
the high non-convexity of the underlying optimization process in BMD, which
leads to extreme sensitivity to the initial blur kernel. To address this issue,
we propose a novel framework for BMD that leverages a deep generative model to
encode the kernel prior and induce a better initialization for the blur kernel.
Specifically, we pre-train a kernel generator based on a generative adversarial
network (GAN) to aptly characterize the kernel's prior distribution, as well as
a kernel initializer to provide a well-informed and high-quality starting point
for kernel estimation. By combining these two components, we constrain the BMD
solution within a compact latent kernel manifold, thus alleviating the
aforementioned sensitivity for kernel initialization. Notably, the kernel
generator and initializer are designed to be easily integrated with existing
BMD methods in a plug-and-play manner, enhancing their overall performance.
Furthermore, we extend our approach to tackle blind non-uniform motion
deblurring without the need for additional priors, achieving state-of-the-art
performance on challenging benchmark datasets. The source code is available at

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合语义信息，显著提升了地板平面定位的性能，并展示了灵活性和扩展性。

Abstract: Floorplans provide a compact representation of the building's structure,
revealing not only layout information but also detailed semantics such as the
locations of windows and doors. However, contemporary floorplan localization
techniques mostly focus on matching depth-based structural cues, ignoring the
rich semantics communicated within floorplans. In this work, we introduce a
semantic-aware localization framework that jointly estimates depth and semantic
rays, consolidating over both for predicting a structural-semantic probability
volume. Our probability volume is constructed in a coarse-to-fine manner: We
first sample a small set of rays to obtain an initial low-resolution
probability volume. We then refine these probabilities by performing a denser
sampling only in high-probability regions and process the refined values for
predicting a 2D location and orientation angle. We conduct an evaluation on two
standard floorplan localization benchmarks. Our experiments demonstrate that
our approach substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving
significant improvements in recall metrics compared to prior works. Moreover,
we show that our framework can easily incorporate additional metadata such as
room labels, enabling additional gains in both accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: 深度信息显著提升了手术阶段识别的性能，Geo-RepNet为复杂手术场景提供了一种高效且稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Surgical phase recognition plays a critical role in developing intelligent
assistance systems for minimally invasive procedures such as Endoscopic
Submucosal Dissection (ESD). However, the high visual similarity across
different phases and the lack of structural cues in RGB images pose significant
challenges. Depth information offers valuable geometric cues that can
complement appearance features by providing insights into spatial relationships
and anatomical structures. In this paper, we pioneer the use of depth
information for surgical phase recognition and propose Geo-RepNet, a
geometry-aware convolutional framework that integrates RGB image and depth
information to enhance recognition performance in complex surgical scenes.
Built upon a re-parameterizable RepVGG backbone, Geo-RepNet incorporates the
Depth-Guided Geometric Prior Generation (DGPG) module that extracts geometry
priors from raw depth maps, and the Geometry-Enhanced Multi-scale Attention
(GEMA) to inject spatial guidance through geometry-aware cross-attention and
efficient multi-scale aggregation. To evaluate the effectiveness of our
approach, we construct a nine-phase ESD dataset with dense frame-level
annotations from real-world ESD videos. Extensive experiments on the proposed
dataset demonstrate that Geo-RepNet achieves state-of-the-art performance while
maintaining robustness and high computational efficiency under complex and
low-texture surgical environments.

Abstract: The remarkable representational power of Vision Transformers (ViTs) remains
underutilized in few-shot image classification. In this work, we introduce
ViT-ProtoNet, which integrates a ViT-Small backbone into the Prototypical
Network framework. By averaging class conditional token embeddings from a
handful of support examples, ViT-ProtoNet constructs robust prototypes that
generalize to novel categories under 5-shot settings. We conduct an extensive
empirical evaluation on four standard benchmarks: Mini-ImageNet, FC100,
CUB-200, and CIFAR-FS, including overlapped support variants to assess
robustness. Across all splits, ViT-ProtoNet consistently outperforms CNN-based
prototypical counterparts, achieving up to a 3.2\% improvement in 5-shot
accuracy and demonstrating superior feature separability in latent space.
Furthermore, it outperforms or is competitive with transformer-based
competitors using a more lightweight backbone. Comprehensive ablations examine
the impact of transformer depth, patch size, and fine-tuning strategy. To
foster reproducibility, we release code and pretrained weights. Our results
establish ViT-ProtoNet as a powerful, flexible approach for few-shot
classification and set a new baseline for transformer-based meta-learners.

Conclusion: DAA*在路径最优性和搜索效率间取得平衡，为模仿学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Path smoothness is often overlooked in path imitation learning from expert
demonstrations. In this paper, we introduce a novel learning method, termed
deep angular A* (DAA*), by incorporating the proposed path angular freedom
(PAF) into A* to improve path similarity through adaptive path smoothness. The
PAF aims to explore the effect of move angles on path node expansion by finding
the trade-off between their minimum and maximum values, allowing for high
adaptiveness for imitation learning. DAA* improves path optimality by closely
aligning with the reference path through joint optimization of path shortening
and smoothing, which correspond to heuristic distance and PAF, respectively.
Throughout comprehensive evaluations on 7 datasets, including 4 maze datasets,
2 video-game datasets, and a real-world drone-view dataset containing 2
scenarios, we demonstrate remarkable improvements of our DAA* over neural A* in
path similarity between the predicted and reference paths with a shorter path
length when the shortest path is plausible, improving by 9.0% SPR, 6.9% ASIM,
and 3.9% PSIM. Furthermore, when jointly learning pathfinding with both path
loss and path probability map loss, DAA* significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art TransPath by 6.7% SPR, 6.5% PSIM, and 3.7% ASIM. We also
discuss the minor trade-off between path optimality and search efficiency where
applicable.

*Zile Wang,Hao Yu,Jiabo Zhan,Chun Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了ALPHA基准和ALPHAVAE模型，用于生成透明或分层内容（RGBA图像），并在少量数据上实现了优于现有方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有潜在扩散模型在RGB图像合成上表现优异，但透明或分层内容生成因缺乏大规模基准而未被充分探索。

Method: 提出ALPHA基准，扩展RGB指标至四通道图像；开发ALPHAVAE模型，结合复合目标训练，包括alpha混合像素重建和多约束优化。

Result: ALPHAVAE在仅8K图像训练下，PSNR提升4.9 dB，SSIM提高3.2%，并在透明图像生成中表现优越。

Conclusion: ALPHAVAE为RGBA图像生成提供了高效解决方案，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Recent advances in latent diffusion models have achieved remarkable results
in high-fidelity RGB image synthesis by leveraging pretrained VAEs to compress
and reconstruct pixel data at low computational cost. However, the generation
of transparent or layered content (RGBA image) remains largely unexplored, due
to the lack of large-scale benchmarks. In this work, we propose ALPHA, the
first comprehensive RGBA benchmark that adapts standard RGB metrics to
four-channel images via alpha blending over canonical backgrounds. We further
introduce ALPHAVAE, a unified end-to-end RGBA VAE that extends a pretrained RGB
VAE by incorporating a dedicated alpha channel. The model is trained with a
composite objective that combines alpha-blended pixel reconstruction,
patch-level fidelity, perceptual consistency, and dual KL divergence
constraints to ensure latent fidelity across both RGB and alpha
representations. Our RGBA VAE, trained on only 8K images in contrast to 1M used
by prior methods, achieves a +4.9 dB improvement in PSNR and a +3.2% increase
in SSIM over LayerDiffuse in reconstruction. It also enables superior
transparent image generation when fine-tuned within a latent diffusion
framework. Our code, data, and models are released on
https://github.com/o0o0o00o0/AlphaVAE for reproducibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分类方法在室外数据集上表现不佳，存在稀疏标注、尺度差异和长尾分布问题。

Method: 采用网格平衡采样生成训练样本，多尺度特征融合模块解决尺度变化问题，自适应混合损失模块平衡不同类别学习能力。

Result: 在三个多光谱点云数据集上验证了方法的有效性，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了多光谱点云分类性能，尤其在稀疏标注和长尾分布场景下。

Abstract: Multispectral point cloud (MPC) captures 3D spatial-spectral information from
the observed scene, which can be used for scene understanding and has a wide
range of applications. However, most of the existing classification methods
were extensively tested on indoor datasets, and when applied to outdoor
datasets they still face problems including sparse labeled targets, differences
in land-covers scales, and long-tailed distributions. To address the above
issues, an enhanced classification method based on adaptive multi-scale fusion
for MPCs with long-tailed distributions is proposed. In the training set
generation stage, a grid-balanced sampling strategy is designed to reliably
generate training samples from sparse labeled datasets. In the feature learning
stage, a multi-scale feature fusion module is proposed to fuse shallow features
of land-covers at different scales, addressing the issue of losing fine
features due to scale variations in land-covers. In the classification stage,
an adaptive hybrid loss module is devised to utilize multi-classification heads
with adaptive weights to balance the learning ability of different classes,
improving the classification performance of small classes due to various-scales
and long-tailed distributions in land-covers. Experimental results on three MPC
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with the
state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 随着多模态对话系统研究的深入，用户期望系统能更主动交互，如实时决定多轮响应时机。

Method: 提出ProactiveBench基准和PAUC指标，评估系统在主动交互中的表现，考虑响应时间动态性。

Result: PAUC与传统指标相比更符合人类偏好，能更准确评估主动交互场景的用户体验。

Conclusion: PAUC为主动交互提供了更可靠的评估方法，有助于推动多模态对话系统的发展。

Abstract: With the growing research focus on multimodal dialogue systems, the
capability for proactive interaction is gradually gaining recognition. As an
alternative to conventional turn-by-turn dialogue, users increasingly expect
multimodal systems to be more initiative, for example, by autonomously
determining the timing of multi-turn responses in real time during video
playback. To facilitate progress in this emerging area, we introduce
ProactiveBench, the first comprehensive benchmark to evaluate a system's
ability to engage in proactive interaction. Since model responses are generated
at varying timestamps, we further propose PAUC, the first metric that accounts
for the temporal dynamics of model responses. This enables a more accurate
evaluation of systems operating in proactive settings. Through extensive
benchmarking of various baseline systems on ProactiveBench and a user study of
human preferences, we show that PAUC is in better agreement with human
preferences than traditional evaluation metrics, which typically only consider
the textual content of responses. These findings demonstrate that PAUC provides
a more faithful assessment of user experience in proactive interaction
scenarios. Project homepage:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频-视频预训练方法仅关注整体模态对齐，忽略了通过认知归纳和对比强化易混淆类别的区分能力。

Method: 提出DICCAE编码器，动态调整类间混淆损失，并结合音频、视频及其融合模态的训练框架；为解决数据稀缺问题，提出聚类引导的自监督预训练策略。

Result: 在VGGSound数据集上达到65.5%的top-1准确率，接近最先进水平，并通过消融实验验证各模块的必要性。

Conclusion: DICCAE通过细粒度类别对齐和动态混淆损失，有效提升了音频-视频活动识别的性能。

Abstract: Humans do not understand individual events in isolation; rather, they
generalize concepts within classes and compare them to others. Existing
audio-video pre-training paradigms only focus on the alignment of the overall
audio-video modalities, without considering the reinforcement of distinguishing
easily confused classes through cognitive induction and contrast during
training. This paper proposes the Dynamic Inter-Class Confusion-Aware Encoder
(DICCAE), an encoder that aligns audio-video representations at a fine-grained,
category-level. DICCAE addresses category confusion by dynamically adjusting
the confusion loss based on inter-class confusion degrees, thereby enhancing
the model's ability to distinguish between similar activities. To further
extend the application of DICCAE, we also introduce a novel training framework
that incorporates both audio and video modalities, as well as their fusion. To
mitigate the scarcity of audio-video data in the human activity recognition
task, we propose a cluster-guided audio-video self-supervised pre-training
strategy for DICCAE. DICCAE achieves near state-of-the-art performance on the
VGGSound dataset, with a top-1 accuracy of 65.5%. We further evaluate its
feature representation quality through extensive ablation studies, validating
the necessity of each module.

TL;DR: Fast3D是一个用于3D多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的视觉标记修剪框架，通过全局注意力预测和样本自适应修剪提高计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D MLLMs在场景理解方面表现优异，但计算效率低，主要由于处理过多的物体中心视觉标记。

Method: 提出Fast3D框架，包括全局注意力预测（GAP）和样本自适应修剪（SAP），无需修改目标模型参数。

Result: 在五个基准测试中验证了Fast3D的有效性，尤其是在高修剪比例下。

Conclusion: Fast3D显著提升了3D MLLMs的计算效率，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: While 3D Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable
scene understanding capabilities, their practical deployment faces critical
challenges due to computational inefficiency. The key bottleneck stems from
processing excessive object-centric visual tokens required for comprehensive 3D
scene representation. Although visual token pruning has shown promise in
accelerating 2D MLLMs, its applicability to 3D domains remains largely
unexplored due to fundamental disparities in token structures. In this paper,
we reveal two critical insights: (1) Significant redundancy exists in
object-level 3D token representations, analogous to patch-level redundancy in
2D systems; (2) Global attention patterns exhibit strong predictive power for
identifying non-essential tokens in 3D contexts. Building on these
observations, we propose Fast3D, a plug-and-play visual token pruning framework
for 3D MLLMs featuring two technical innovations: (1) Global Attention
Prediction (GAP), where a lightweight neural network learns to predict the
global attention distributions of the target model, enabling efficient token
importance estimation for precise pruning guidance; (2) Sample-Adaptive visual
token Pruning (SAP), which introduces dynamic token budgets through
attention-based complexity assessment, automatically adjusting layer-wise
pruning ratios based on input characteristics. Both of these two techniques
operate without modifying the parameters of the target model. Extensive
evaluations across five benchmarks validate the effectiveness of Fast3D,
particularly under high visual token pruning ratios. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有TAD方法依赖复杂架构，但预训练基础模型可能简化设计并提升性能。

Method: 采用简单的编码器架构（Video ViTs），研究预训练（自监督、弱监督、全监督）对TAD的影响。

Result: 强预训练使简单模型性能超越复杂方法；自监督MVM效果最佳；领域自适应预训练（DAPT）进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: 预训练是TAD的关键，简单架构结合有效预训练可实现高效、可扩展的模型。

Abstract: Recent methods for ego-centric Traffic Anomaly Detection (TAD) often rely on
complex multi-stage or multi-representation fusion architectures, yet it
remains unclear whether such complexity is necessary. Recent findings in visual
perception suggest that foundation models, enabled by advanced pre-training,
allow simple yet flexible architectures to outperform specialized designs.
Therefore, in this work, we investigate an architecturally simple encoder-only
approach using plain Video Vision Transformers (Video ViTs) and study how
pre-training enables strong TAD performance. We find that: (i) strong
pre-training enables simple encoder-only models to match or even surpass the
performance of specialized state-of-the-art TAD methods, while also being
significantly more efficient; (ii) although weakly- and fully-supervised
pre-training are advantageous on standard benchmarks, we find them less
effective for TAD. Instead, self-supervised Masked Video Modeling (MVM)
provides the strongest signal; and (iii) Domain-Adaptive Pre-Training (DAPT) on
unlabeled driving videos further improves downstream performance, without
requiring anomalous examples. Our findings highlight the importance of
pre-training and show that effective, efficient, and scalable TAD models can be
built with minimal architectural complexity. We release our code,
domain-adapted encoders, and fine-tuned models to support future work:

Abstract: Crop diseases present a significant barrier to agricultural productivity and
global food security, especially in large-scale farming where early
identification is often delayed or inaccurate. This research introduces a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based image classification system designed
to automate the detection and classification of eight common crop diseases
using leaf imagery. The methodology involves a complete deep learning pipeline:
image acquisition from a large, labeled dataset, preprocessing via resizing,
normalization, and augmentation, and model training using TensorFlow with
Keras' Sequential API. The CNN architecture comprises three convolutional
layers with increasing filter sizes and ReLU activations, followed by max
pooling, flattening, and fully connected layers, concluding with a softmax
output for multi-class classification. The system achieves high training
accuracy (~90%) and demonstrates reliable performance on unseen data, although
a validation accuracy of ~60% suggests minor overfitting. Notably, the model
integrates a treatment recommendation module, providing actionable guidance by
mapping each detected disease to suitable pesticide or fungicide interventions.
Furthermore, the solution is deployed on an open-source, mobile-compatible
platform, enabling real-time image-based diagnostics for farmers in remote
areas. This research contributes a scalable and accessible tool to the field of
precision agriculture, reducing reliance on manual inspection and promoting
sustainable disease management practices. By merging deep learning with
practical agronomic support, this work underscores the potential of CNNs to
transform crop health monitoring and enhance food production resilience on a
global scale.

Abstract: Camera traps have long been used by wildlife researchers to monitor and study
animal behavior, population dynamics, habitat use, and species diversity in a
non-invasive and efficient manner. While data collection from the field has
increased with new tools and capabilities, methods to develop, process, and
manage the data, especially the adoption of ML/AI tools, remain challenging.
These challenges include the sheer volume of data generated, the need for
accurate labeling and annotation, variability in environmental conditions
affecting data quality, and the integration of ML/AI tools into existing
workflows that often require domain-specific customization and computational
resources. This paper provides a guide to a low-resource pipeline to process
camera trap data on-premise, incorporating ML/AI capabilities tailored for
small research groups with limited resources and computational expertise. By
focusing on practical solutions, the pipeline offers accessible approaches for
data transmission, inference, and evaluation, enabling researchers to discover
meaningful insights from their ever-increasing camera trap datasets.

Abstract: The detection and tracking of celestial surface terrain features are crucial
for autonomous spaceflight applications, including Terrain Relative Navigation
(TRN), Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL), hazard analysis, and scientific data
collection. Traditional photoclinometry-based pipelines often rely on extensive
a priori imaging and offline processing, constrained by the computational
limitations of radiation-hardened systems. While historically effective, these
approaches typically increase mission costs and duration, operate at low
processing rates, and have limited generalization. Recently, learning-based
computer vision has gained popularity to enhance spacecraft autonomy and
overcome these limitations. While promising, emerging techniques frequently
impose computational demands exceeding the capabilities of typical spacecraft
hardware for real-time operation and are further challenged by the scarcity of
labeled training data for diverse extraterrestrial environments. In this work,
we present novel formulations for in-situ landmark tracking via detection and
description. We utilize lightweight, computationally efficient neural network
architectures designed for real-time execution on current-generation spacecraft
flight processors. For landmark detection, we propose improved domain
adaptation methods that enable the identification of celestial terrain features
with distinct, cheaply acquired training data. Concurrently, for landmark
description, we introduce a novel attention alignment formulation that learns
robust feature representations that maintain correspondence despite significant
landmark viewpoint variations. Together, these contributions form a unified
system for landmark tracking that demonstrates superior performance compared to
existing state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: 提出的模型高效且性能优越，为多人体运动预测提供了新思路。

Abstract: 3D multi-person motion prediction is a highly complex task, primarily due to
the dependencies on both individual past movements and the interactions between
agents. Moreover, effectively modeling these interactions often incurs
substantial computational costs. In this work, we propose a computationally
efficient model for multi-person motion prediction by simplifying spatial and
temporal interactions. Our approach begins with the design of lightweight dual
branches that learn local and global representations for individual and
multiple persons separately. Additionally, we introduce a novel cross-level
interaction block to integrate the spatial and temporal representations from
both branches. To further enhance interaction modeling, we explicitly
incorporate the spatial inter-person distance embedding. With above efficient
temporal and spatial design, we achieve state-of-the-art performance for
multiple metrics on standard datasets of CMU-Mocap, MuPoTS-3D, and 3DPW, while
significantly reducing the computational cost. Code is available at

Result: 实验表明CKAA优于现有PEFT-based CL方法。

Conclusion: CKAA通过知识对齐和自适应聚合，显著提升了模型对误导任务ID的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) empowers AI models to continuously learn from
sequential task streams. Recently, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)-based
CL methods have garnered increasing attention due to their superior
performance. They typically allocate a unique sub-module for learning each
task, with a task recognizer to select the appropriate sub-modules for testing
images. However, due to the feature subspace misalignment from independently
trained sub-modules, these methods tend to produce ambiguous decisions under
misleading task-ids. To address this, we propose Cross-subspace Knowledge
Alignment and Aggregation (CKAA), a novel framework that enhances model
robustness against misleading task-ids through two key innovations: (1)
Dual-level Knowledge Alignment (DKA): By aligning intra-class feature
distributions across different subspaces and learning a robust global
classifier through a feature simulation process, DKA enables the model to
distinguish features from both correct and incorrect subspaces during training.
(2) Task-Confidence-guided Mixture of Adapters (TC-MoA): A robust inference
scheme that adaptively aggregates task-specific knowledge from relevant
sub-modules based on task-confidence scores, avoiding overconfidence in
misleading task-id predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CKAA
outperforms existing PEFT-based CL methods.

Motivation: 视觉和语义概念通常以层次结构组织，现有方法如MERU在双曲空间中表现良好，但如何更高效地训练模型以利用这种层次结构仍是一个关键问题。

Method: 提出HMID-Net，在双曲空间中整合掩码图像建模（MIM）和知识蒸馏技术，并设计了一种专门的双曲空间蒸馏损失函数。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在双曲空间中的表现与欧几里得空间相当，并在图像分类和检索任务中显著优于MERU和CLIP。

Conclusion: HMID-Net通过双曲空间中的MIM和知识蒸馏，高效捕捉层次结构，为多模态学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Visual and semantic concepts are often structured in a hierarchical manner.
For instance, textual concept `cat' entails all images of cats. A recent study,
MERU, successfully adapts multimodal learning techniques from Euclidean space
to hyperbolic space, effectively capturing the visual-semantic hierarchy.
However, a critical question remains: how can we more efficiently train a model
to capture and leverage this hierarchy? In this paper, we propose the
\textit{Hyperbolic Masked Image and Distillation Network} (HMID-Net), a novel
and efficient method that integrates Masked Image Modeling (MIM) and knowledge
distillation techniques within hyperbolic space. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first approach to leverage MIM and knowledge distillation in
hyperbolic space to train highly efficient models. In addition, we introduce a
distillation loss function specifically designed to facilitate effective
knowledge transfer in hyperbolic space. Our experiments demonstrate that MIM
and knowledge distillation techniques in hyperbolic space can achieve the same
remarkable success as in Euclidean space. Extensive evaluations show that our
method excels across a wide range of downstream tasks, significantly
outperforming existing models like MERU and CLIP in both image classification
and retrieval.

TL;DR: GLIMPSE是一个新的视频基准测试，旨在评估大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）是否能够真正理解视频内容，而不仅仅是静态图像分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频基准测试多基于静态图像分析，无法评估模型是否具备深度时间推理能力。

Method: GLIMPSE包含3,269个视频和4,342个视觉中心问题，覆盖11个类别，要求模型观看完整视频并进行推理。

Result: 人类评估准确率达94.82%，但最佳LVLM模型（GPT-o3）仅达到66.43%。

Conclusion: LVLMs仍需改进，以实现真正的视频理解。

Abstract: Existing video benchmarks often resemble image-based benchmarks, with
question types like "What actions does the person perform throughout the
video?" or "What color is the woman's dress in the video?" For these, models
can often answer by scanning just a few key frames, without deep temporal
reasoning. This limits our ability to assess whether large vision-language
models (LVLMs) can truly think with videos rather than perform superficial
frame-level analysis. To address this, we introduce GLIMPSE, a benchmark
specifically designed to evaluate whether LVLMs can genuinely think with
videos. Unlike prior benchmarks, GLIMPSE emphasizes comprehensive video
understanding beyond static image cues. It consists of 3,269 videos and over
4,342 highly visual-centric questions across 11 categories, including
Trajectory Analysis, Temporal Reasoning, and Forensics Detection. All questions
are carefully crafted by human annotators and require watching the entire video
and reasoning over full video context-this is what we mean by thinking with
video. These questions cannot be answered by scanning selected frames or
relying on text alone. In human evaluations, GLIMPSE achieves 94.82% accuracy,
but current LVLMs face significant challenges. Even the best-performing model,
GPT-o3, reaches only 66.43%, highlighting that LVLMs still struggle to move

*Fuyin Ye,Erwen Yao,Jianyong Chen,Fengmei He,Junxiang Zhang,Lihao Ni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合张量分解和正则化的自适应性网络（SDTN）及轻量级网络（TRN），用于高光谱图像分类，显著提升精度并降低计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在处理高维数据、光谱-空间冗余和标记样本稀缺时表现不佳，需要一种更高效且适应性强的解决方案。

Method: SDTN通过动态调整张量秩优化特征表示，TRN则利用SDTN提取的特征构建轻量级网络，实现多尺度光谱-空间特征捕获。

Result: 在PaviaU数据集上实验表明，该方法在分类精度和模型参数减少方面优于现有技术。

Conclusion: SDTN和TRN的组合为高光谱图像分类提供了一种高效且适应性强的解决方案，适用于资源受限环境。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image classification plays a pivotal role in precision
agriculture, providing accurate insights into crop health monitoring, disease
detection, and soil analysis. However, traditional methods struggle with
high-dimensional data, spectral-spatial redundancy, and the scarcity of labeled
samples, often leading to suboptimal performance. To address these challenges,
we propose the Self-Adaptive Tensor- Regularized Network (SDTN), which combines
tensor decomposition with regularization mechanisms to dynamically adjust
tensor ranks, ensuring optimal feature representation tailored to the
complexity of the data. Building upon SDTN, we propose the Tensor-Regularized
Network (TRN), which integrates the features extracted by SDTN into a
lightweight network capable of capturing spectral-spatial features at multiple
scales. This approach not only maintains high classification accuracy but also
significantly reduces computational complexity, making the framework highly
suitable for real-time deployment in resource-constrained environments.
Experiments on PaviaU datasets demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy
and reduced model parameters compared to state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种可靠的测试时适应方法（ReTA），通过一致性感知熵重加权（CER）和多样性驱动的分布校准（DDC）解决现有缓存方法在分布偏移下的可靠性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型（VLMs）在零样本任务中表现优异，但在无标注数据的下游任务中面临分布偏移问题，现有缓存方法因熵不可靠和决策边界不灵活导致性能下降。

Method: ReTA结合CER（利用一致性约束加权熵）和DDC（将类文本嵌入建模为高斯分布以调整决策边界），提升缓存质量和预测准确性。

Result: 实验表明，ReTA在真实分布偏移场景下显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ReTA通过双重策略有效提升了测试时适应的可靠性，为分布偏移问题提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit remarkable zero-shot capabilities but
struggle with distribution shifts in downstream tasks when labeled data is
unavailable, which has motivated the development of Test-Time Adaptation (TTA)
to improve VLMs' performance during inference without annotations. Among
various TTA approaches, cache-based methods show promise by preserving
historical knowledge from low-entropy samples in a dynamic cache and fostering
efficient adaptation. However, these methods face two critical reliability
challenges: (1) entropy often becomes unreliable under distribution shifts,
causing error accumulation in the cache and degradation in adaptation
performance; (2) the final predictions may be unreliable due to inflexible
decision boundaries that fail to accommodate large downstream shifts. To
address these challenges, we propose a Reliable Test-time Adaptation (ReTA)
method that integrates two complementary strategies to enhance reliability from
two perspectives. First, to mitigate the unreliability of entropy as a sample
selection criterion for cache construction, we introduce Consistency-aware
Entropy Reweighting (CER), which incorporates consistency constraints to weight
entropy during cache updating. While conventional approaches rely solely on low
entropy for cache prioritization and risk introducing noise, our method
leverages predictive consistency to maintain a high-quality cache and
facilitate more robust adaptation. Second, we present Diversity-driven
Distribution Calibration (DDC), which models class-wise text embeddings as
multivariate Gaussian distributions, enabling adaptive decision boundaries for
more accurate predictions across visually diverse content. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that ReTA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, particularly under challenging real-world distribution shifts.

Conclusion: 所提方法在微手势在线识别任务中表现优异，显著优于现有技术。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the latest solution developed by our team,
HFUT-VUT, for the Micro-gesture Online Recognition track of the IJCAI 2025 MiGA
Challenge. The Micro-gesture Online Recognition task is a highly challenging
problem that aims to locate the temporal positions and recognize the categories
of multiple micro-gesture instances in untrimmed videos. Compared to
traditional temporal action detection, this task places greater emphasis on
distinguishing between micro-gesture categories and precisely identifying the
start and end times of each instance. Moreover, micro-gestures are typically
spontaneous human actions, with greater differences than those found in other
human actions. To address these challenges, we propose hand-crafted data
augmentation and spatial-temporal attention to enhance the model's ability to
classify and localize micro-gestures more accurately. Our solution achieved an
F1 score of 38.03, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art by 37.9%. As a
result, our method ranked first in the Micro-gesture Online Recognition track.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QuarterMap是一种后训练激活剪枝方法，通过移除冗余空间激活并恢复维度，提升VMamba等SSM模型的吞吐量，且无需重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决VMamba等SSM模型中空间冗余问题，提升效率而不影响准确性。

Method: 提出QuarterMap方法，剪枝冗余激活并通过最近邻上采样恢复维度。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K上实现11%速度提升，精度下降小于0.9%；在ADE20K和MedMamba上同样有效。

Conclusion: QuarterMap是一种即插即用的高效部署工具，适用于SSM模型，优于现有方法。

Abstract: State space models (SSMs) reduce the quadratic complexity of transformers by
leveraging linear recurrence. Recently, VMamba has emerged as a strong
SSM-based vision backbone, yet remains bottlenecked by spatial redundancy in
its four-directional scan. We propose QuarterMap, a post-training activation
pruning method that removes redundant spatial activations before scanning and
restores dimensions via nearest-neighbor upsampling. Our method improves
throughput without retraining. On ImageNet-1K, QuarterMap achieves up to 11%
speedup on VMamba with less than 0.9% accuracy drop, and yields similar gains
on ADE20K segmentation. Beyond VMamba, we validate QuarterMap on MedMamba, a
domain-specific model that shares the same four-directional scanning structure,
where it consistently improves throughput while preserving accuracy across
multiple medical imaging tasks. Compared to token merging methods like ToMe,
QuarterMap is tailored for SSMs and avoids costly merge-unmerge operations. Our
method offers a plug-and-play tool for deployment-time efficiency without
compromising transferability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DehazeSB提出了一种基于Schr\"odinger Bridge的无配对去雾框架，利用最优传输理论直接桥接雾图和清晰图的分布，并通过细节保留正则化和提示学习提升效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于GAN的无配对去雾方法因生成器的传输映射能力有限，效果受限。

Method: 采用Schr\"odinger Bridge框架，结合最优传输理论和细节保留正则化，并引入提示学习利用CLIP模型区分雾图和清晰图。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上表现优越。

Conclusion: DehazeSB通过优化传输映射和细节保留，显著提升了无配对去雾的效果。

Abstract: Recent advancements in unpaired dehazing, particularly those using GANs, show
promising performance in processing real-world hazy images. However, these
methods tend to face limitations due to the generator's limited transport
mapping capability, which hinders the full exploitation of their effectiveness
in unpaired training paradigms. To address these challenges, we propose
DehazeSB, a novel unpaired dehazing framework based on the Schr\"odinger
Bridge. By leveraging optimal transport (OT) theory, DehazeSB directly bridges
the distributions between hazy and clear images. This enables optimal transport
mappings from hazy to clear images in fewer steps, thereby generating
high-quality results. To ensure the consistency of structural information and
details in the restored images, we introduce detail-preserving regularization,
which enforces pixel-level alignment between hazy inputs and dehazed outputs.
Furthermore, we propose a novel prompt learning to leverage pre-trained CLIP
models in distinguishing hazy images and clear ones, by learning a haze-aware
vision-language alignment. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world
datasets demonstrate our method's superiority. Code:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VDInstruct是一种多模态大语言模型，通过内容感知的分词策略和显式布局建模，显著提升了密集文档的理解能力，减少了计算冗余，并在KIE基准测试中达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM在密集文档上表现不佳，且视觉分词方法随图像大小扩展，导致计算冗余和内存效率低下。

Method: VDInstruct将空间区域检测与语义特征提取分离，采用内容感知的分词策略，根据文档复杂度生成分词，并通过三阶段训练范式优化模型。

Result: 模型在KIE基准测试中达到SOTA，减少约3.6倍的图像分词，零样本评估中F1分数超过基线5.5分。

Conclusion: 内容感知分词与显式布局建模为文档理解提供了有前景的方向，模型将公开数据、源代码和权重。

Abstract: Key Information Extraction (KIE) underpins the understanding of visual
documents (e.g., receipts and contracts) by extracting precise semantic content
and accurately capturing spatial structure. Yet existing multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) often perform poorly on dense documents and rely on
vision tokenization approaches that scale with image size, leading to redundant
computation and memory inefficiency. To address these challenges, we introduce
VDInstruct, an MLLM that separates spatial region detection from semantic
feature extraction. Central to our model is a content-aware tokenization
strategy: rather than fragmenting the entire image uniformly, it generates
tokens in proportion to document complexity, preserving critical structure
while eliminating wasted tokens. Leveraging a three-stage training paradigm,
our model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on KIE benchmarks, matching
or exceeding the accuracy of leading approaches while reducing the number of
image tokens by roughly 3.6x. In zero-shot evaluations, VDInstruct surpasses
strong baselines-such as DocOwl 1.5-by +5.5 F1 points, highlighting its
robustness to unseen documents. These findings show that content-aware
tokenization combined with explicit layout modeling offers a promising
direction forward for document understanding. Data, source code, and model
weights will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态RPCA网络（DRPCA-Net），通过结合稀疏性先验和深度学习，提升了红外小目标检测的性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在红外小目标检测中过于依赖复杂架构，忽视了目标稀疏性先验，导致模型可解释性、参数效率和泛化能力不足。

Method: 提出DRPCA-Net，结合模型驱动的RPCA和深度展开网络，引入动态展开机制和动态残差组模块，自适应生成参数并优化背景建模。

Result: 在多个公开红外数据集上，DRPCA-Net显著优于现有方法，检测精度更高。

Conclusion: DRPCA-Net通过动态机制和稀疏性先验的结合，实现了高效且鲁棒的红外小目标检测。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection plays a vital role in remote sensing,
industrial monitoring, and various civilian applications. Despite recent
progress powered by deep learning, many end-to-end convolutional models tend to
pursue performance by stacking increasingly complex architectures, often at the
expense of interpretability, parameter efficiency, and generalization. These
models typically overlook the intrinsic sparsity prior of infrared small
targets--an essential cue that can be explicitly modeled for both performance
and efficiency gains. To address this, we revisit the model-based paradigm of
Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) and propose Dynamic RPCA Network
(DRPCA-Net), a novel deep unfolding network that integrates the sparsity-aware
prior into a learnable architecture. Unlike conventional deep unfolding methods
that rely on static, globally learned parameters, DRPCA-Net introduces a
dynamic unfolding mechanism via a lightweight hypernetwork. This design enables
the model to adaptively generate iteration-wise parameters conditioned on the
input scene, thereby enhancing its robustness and generalization across diverse
backgrounds. Furthermore, we design a Dynamic Residual Group (DRG) module to
better capture contextual variations within the background, leading to more
accurate low-rank estimation and improved separation of small targets.
Extensive experiments on multiple public infrared datasets demonstrate that
DRPCA-Net significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in
detection accuracy. Code is available at https://github.com/GrokCV/DRPCA-Net.

Method: 提出了DeRefNet框架，包含Temporal Deformable Feature Alignment模块，用于自适应帧间信息聚合。

Result: 在SeqCSIST数据集上，DeRefNet的mAP指标比现有方法提高了5.3%。

Conclusion: 该研究首次在多帧范式中解决CSIST Unmixing任务，并提供了数据集和工具包以推动相关研究。

Abstract: Due to the limitation of the optical lens focal length and the resolution of
the infrared detector, distant Closely-Spaced Infrared Small Target (CSIST)
groups typically appear as mixing spots in the infrared image. In this paper,
we propose a novel task, Sequential CSIST Unmixing, namely detecting all
targets in the form of sub-pixel localization from a highly dense CSIST group.
However, achieving such precise detection is an extremely difficult challenge.
In addition, the lack of high-quality public datasets has also restricted the
research progress. To this end, firstly, we contribute an open-source
ecosystem, including SeqCSIST, a sequential benchmark dataset, and a toolkit
that provides objective evaluation metrics for this special task, along with
the implementation of 23 relevant methods. Furthermore, we propose the
Deformable Refinement Network (DeRefNet), a model-driven deep learning
framework that introduces a Temporal Deformable Feature Alignment (TDFA) module
enabling adaptive inter-frame information aggregation. To the best of our
knowledge, this work is the first endeavor to address the CSIST Unmixing task
within a multi-frame paradigm. Experiments on the SeqCSIST dataset demonstrate
that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches with mean Average
Precision (mAP) metric improved by 5.3\%. Our dataset and toolkit are available

TL;DR: 提出了一种分段架构EHPE，通过局部提取TIP和手腕关节，减少误差累积，提升手部姿态估计精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视TIP和手腕关节的重要性，导致远端关节误差累积，影响整体估计质量。

Method: EHPE分为TW阶段（提取TIP和手腕）和PG阶段（双分支网络细化其他关节）。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: EHPE通过分段处理显著提升了手部姿态估计的准确性。

Abstract: 3D hand pose estimation has garnered great attention in recent years due to
its critical applications in human-computer interaction, virtual reality, and
related fields. The accurate estimation of hand joints is essential for
high-quality hand pose estimation. However, existing methods neglect the
importance of Distal Phalanx Tip (TIP) and Wrist in predicting hand joints
overall and often fail to account for the phenomenon of error accumulation for
distal joints in gesture estimation, which can cause certain joints to incur
larger errors, resulting in misalignments and artifacts in the pose estimation
and degrading the overall reconstruction quality. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel segmented architecture for enhanced hand pose estimation
(EHPE). We perform local extraction of TIP and wrist, thus alleviating the
effect of error accumulation on TIP prediction and further reduce the
predictive errors for all joints on this basis. EHPE consists of two key
stages: In the TIP and Wrist Joints Extraction stage (TW-stage), the positions
of the TIP and wrist joints are estimated to provide an initial accurate joint
configuration; In the Prior Guided Joints Estimation stage (PG-stage), a
dual-branch interaction network is employed to refine the positions of the
remaining joints. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmarks
demonstrate that EHPE achieves state-of-the-arts performance. Code is available

Abstract: Recent text-to-image models produce high-quality results but still struggle
with precise visual control, balancing multimodal inputs, and requiring
extensive training for complex multimodal image generation. To address these
limitations, we propose MENTOR, a novel autoregressive (AR) framework for
efficient Multimodal-conditioned Tuning for Autoregressive multimodal image
generation. MENTOR combines an AR image generator with a two-stage training
paradigm, enabling fine-grained, token-level alignment between multimodal
inputs and image outputs without relying on auxiliary adapters or
cross-attention modules. The two-stage training consists of: (1) a multimodal
alignment stage that establishes robust pixel- and semantic-level alignment,
followed by (2) a multimodal instruction tuning stage that balances the
integration of multimodal inputs and enhances generation controllability.
Despite modest model size, suboptimal base components, and limited training
resources, MENTOR achieves strong performance on the DreamBench++ benchmark,
outperforming competitive baselines in concept preservation and prompt
following. Additionally, our method delivers superior image reconstruction
fidelity, broad task adaptability, and improved training efficiency compared to
diffusion-based methods. Dataset, code, and models are available at:

Result: 系统能高质量生成单字符和多字符的艺术字体，支持多语言和多样化用户工作流。

Conclusion: WordCraft提升了艺术字体合成的交互性和创造性，为艺术家和设计师提供了更多可能性。

Abstract: Artistic typography aims to stylize input characters with visual effects that
are both creative and legible. Traditional approaches rely heavily on manual
design, while recent generative models, particularly diffusion-based methods,
have enabled automated character stylization. However, existing solutions
remain limited in interactivity, lacking support for localized edits, iterative
refinement, multi-character composition, and open-ended prompt interpretation.
We introduce WordCraft, an interactive artistic typography system that
integrates diffusion models to address these limitations. WordCraft features a
training-free regional attention mechanism for precise, multi-region generation
and a noise blending that supports continuous refinement without compromising
visual quality. To support flexible, intent-driven generation, we incorporate a
large language model to parse and structure both concrete and abstract user
prompts. These components allow our framework to synthesize high-quality,
stylized typography across single- and multi-character inputs across multiple
languages, supporting diverse user-centered workflows. Our system significantly
enhances interactivity in artistic typography synthesis, opening up creative
possibilities for artists and designers.

Abstract: Video understanding plays a vital role in bridging low-level visual signals
with high-level cognitive reasoning, and is fundamental to applications such as
autonomous driving, embodied AI, and the broader pursuit of AGI. The rapid
development of large language models (LLMs), particularly those utilizing
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technology, has significantly advanced video reasoning
capabilities. However, current approaches primarily depend on textual
information for reasoning, overlooking the visual modality in the actual video
reasoning process. In contrast, humans naturally re-examine visual content
while reasoning. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel video reasoning
paradigm: Video-Text Interleaved CoT (ViTCoT), which facilitates more intuitive
and cognitively aligned reasoning. To the end, first, we construct the
Video-Text Interleaved Benchmark (ViTIB), which is created using MLLMs for
key-video selection and manually verified. Furthermore, we extensively explore
the potential of the ViTCoT paradigm in the video understanding field.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViTCoT significantly enhances
performance compared to the traditional text-only CoT paradigm and effectively
activates more neuron values in MLLMs.

Conclusion: MA-SAM2在无需额外参数或训练的情况下，显著提升了手术视频分割的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Surgical video segmentation is a critical task in computer-assisted surgery,
essential for enhancing surgical quality and patient outcomes. Recently, the
Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) framework has demonstrated remarkable
advancements in both image and video segmentation. However, the inherent
limitations of SAM2's greedy selection memory design are amplified by the
unique properties of surgical videos-rapid instrument movement, frequent
occlusion, and complex instrument-tissue interaction-resulting in diminished
performance in the segmentation of complex, long videos. To address these
challenges, we introduce Memory Augmented (MA)-SAM2, a training-free video
object segmentation strategy, featuring novel context-aware and
occlusion-resilient memory models. MA-SAM2 exhibits strong robustness against
occlusions and interactions arising from complex instrument movements while
maintaining accuracy in segmenting objects throughout videos. Employing a
multi-target, single-loop, one-prompt inference further enhances the efficiency
of the tracking process in multi-instrument videos. Without introducing any
additional parameters or requiring further training, MA-SAM2 achieved
performance improvements of 4.36% and 6.1% over SAM2 on the EndoVis2017 and
EndoVis2018 datasets, respectively, demonstrating its potential for practical
surgical applications.

### [74] [Cross-modal Associations in Vision and Language Models: Revisiting the bouba-kiki effect](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10013)
*Tom Kouwenhoven,Kiana Shahrasbi,Tessa Verhoef*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究重新评估了两种CLIP变体（ResNet和ViT）在bouba-kiki效应中的表现，发现模型未能像人类一样一致地关联形状与伪词。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨视觉-语言模型（VLMs）是否以类似人类认知的方式整合跨模态信息。

Method: 采用基于提示的概率评估和Grad-CAM视觉注意力分析，对比人类实验数据。

Result: 模型未表现出稳定的bouba-kiki效应，且表现显著低于人类。

Conclusion: VLMs在跨模态概念理解上存在局限性，与人类认知不一致。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal models have raised questions about whether
vision-and-language models (VLMs) integrate cross-modal information in ways
that reflect human cognition. One well-studied test case in this domain is the
bouba-kiki effect, where humans reliably associate pseudowords like "bouba"
with round shapes and "kiki" with jagged ones. Given the mixed evidence found
in prior studies for this effect in VLMs, we present a comprehensive
re-evaluation focused on two variants of CLIP, ResNet and Vision Transformer
(ViT), given their centrality in many state-of-the-art VLMs. We apply two
complementary methods closely modelled after human experiments: a prompt-based
evaluation that uses probabilities as model preference, and we use Grad-CAM as
a novel way to interpret visual attention in shape-word matching tasks. Our
findings show that these models do not consistently exhibit the bouba-kiki
effect. While ResNet shows a preference for round shapes, overall performance
across both models lacks the expected associations. Moreover, direct comparison
with prior human data on the same task shows that the models' responses fall
markedly short of the robust, modality-integrated behaviour characteristic of
human cognition. These results contribute to the ongoing debate about the
extent to which VLMs truly understand cross-modal concepts, highlighting
limitations in their internal representations and alignment with human
intuitions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中风是全球主要死因之一，早期准确诊断对改善患者预后至关重要，尤其是在紧急情况下。

Abstract: Stroke is one of the leading causes of death globally, making early and
accurate diagnosis essential for improving patient outcomes, particularly in
emergency settings where timely intervention is critical. CT scans are the key
imaging modality because of their speed, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness.
This study proposed an artificial intelligence framework for multiclass stroke
classification (ischemic, hemorrhagic, and no stroke) using CT scan images from
a dataset provided by the Republic of Turkey's Ministry of Health. The proposed
method adopted MaxViT, a state-of-the-art Vision Transformer, as the primary
deep learning model for image-based stroke classification, with additional
transformer variants (vision transformer, transformer-in-transformer, and
ConvNext). To enhance model generalization and address class imbalance, we
applied data augmentation techniques, including synthetic image generation. The
MaxViT model trained with augmentation achieved the best performance, reaching
an accuracy and F1-score of 98.00%, outperforming all other evaluated models
and the baseline methods. The primary goal of this study was to distinguish
between stroke types with high accuracy while addressing crucial issues of
transparency and trust in artificial intelligence models. To achieve this,
Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) was integrated into the framework,
particularly Grad-CAM++. It provides visual explanations of the model's
decisions by highlighting relevant stroke regions in the CT scans and
establishing an accurate, interpretable, and clinically applicable solution for
early stroke detection. This research contributed to the development of a
trustworthy AI-assisted diagnostic tool for stroke, facilitating its
integration into clinical practice and enhancing access to timely and optimal
stroke diagnosis in emergency departments, thereby saving more lives.

TL;DR: Inter2Former通过优化密集令牌处理的计算分配，提出四种关键改进，实现了在CPU设备上高效且高质量的交互式分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前交互式分割方法在密集令牌处理上存在速度与质量的权衡，Inter2Former旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出动态提示嵌入（DPE）、动态混合注意力（DHA）、混合专家（HMoE）和动态局部上采样（DLU）四种改进。

Result: 实验表明，Inter2Former在高精度交互式分割基准上实现了SOTA性能，并在CPU设备上高效运行。

Conclusion: Inter2Former成功平衡了交互式分割的速度与质量，为实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Interactive segmentation (IS) improves annotation efficiency by segmenting
target regions from user prompts, with widespread applications in real-world
scenarios. Current approaches face a critical trade-off: dense-token methods
achieve superior accuracy and detail preservation but suffer from prohibitively
slow processing on CPU devices, while the Segment Anything Model (SAM) advances
the field with sparse prompt tokens for fast inference but compromises
segmentation quality. In this paper, we propose Inter2Former to address this
challenge by optimizing computation allocation in dense-token processing, which
introduces four key enhancements. First, we propose Dynamic Prompt Embedding
(DPE) that adaptively processes only regions of interest while avoiding
additional overhead from background tokens. Second, we introduce Dynamic Hybrid
Attention (DHA), which leverages previous segmentation masks to route tokens
through either full attention (O(N2)) for boundary regions or our proposed
efficient BSQ attention (O(N)) for non-boundary regions. Third, we develop
Hybrid Mixture of Experts (HMoE), which applies similar adaptive computation
strategies in FFN modules with CPU-optimized parallel processing. Finally, we
present Dynamic Local Upsampling (DLU), a reverse operation of DPE, which
localizes objects with a lightweight MLP and performs fine-grained upsampling
only in detected regions. Experimental results on high-precision IS benchmarks
demonstrate that Inter2Former achieves SOTA performance with high efficiency on
CPU devices.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FAIR方法通过动态对齐局部图像特征和语言嵌入，改进了无监督适应中的伪标签生成，显著提升了细粒度分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在无监督适应中无法捕捉细粒度类别差异或计算成本高，FAIR旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出FAIR方法，通过Class Description Anchors动态对齐特征，定义Learned Alignment Score，并结合自训练加权机制优化伪标签。

Result: 在13个细粒度数据集上，FAIR比现有方法平均提升2.78%的性能。

Conclusion: FAIR通过动态对齐和交互优化，显著提升了细粒度无监督适应的性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP excel in zero-shot learning by
aligning image and text representations through contrastive pretraining.
Existing approaches to unsupervised adaptation (UA) for fine-grained
classification with VLMs either rely on fixed alignment scores that cannot
capture evolving, subtle class distinctions or use computationally expensive
pseudo-labeling strategies that limit scalability. In contrast, we show that
modeling fine-grained cross-modal interactions during adaptation produces more
accurate, class-discriminative pseudo-labels and substantially improves
performance over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. We introduce Fine-grained
Alignment and Interaction Refinement (FAIR), an innovative approach that
dynamically aligns localized image features with descriptive language
embeddings through a set of Class Description Anchors (CDA). This enables the
definition of a Learned Alignment Score (LAS), which incorporates CDA as an
adaptive classifier, facilitating cross-modal interactions to improve
self-training in unsupervised adaptation. Furthermore, we propose a
self-training weighting mechanism designed to refine pseudo-labels in the
presence of inter-class ambiguities. Our approach, FAIR, delivers a substantial
performance boost in fine-grained unsupervised adaptation, achieving a notable
overall gain of 2.78% across 13 fine-grained datasets compared to SOTA methods.

Motivation: 现有MLLMs在通用数据集上训练，缺乏对领域特定视觉线索（如面部图像）的推理能力，限制了其在面部结构、表情、情感等任务中的应用。

Method: 提出弱监督流程，利用ChatGPT生成基于FairFace数据集的高质量问答对（FairFaceGPT），训练FaceLLM模型。

Result: FaceLLM在多种面部中心任务中表现优异，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: FaceLLM展示了语言模型合成监督在构建领域专用MLLMs中的潜力，为可信赖的多模态AI系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable performance in
vision-language tasks. However, existing MLLMs are primarily trained on generic
datasets, limiting their ability to reason on domain-specific visual cues such
as those in facial images. In particular, tasks that require detailed
understanding of facial structure, expression, emotion, and demographic
features remain underexplored by MLLMs due to the lack of large-scale annotated
face image-text datasets. In this work, we introduce FaceLLM, a multimodal
large language model trained specifically for facial image understanding. To
construct the training data, we propose a novel weakly supervised pipeline that
uses ChatGPT with attribute-aware prompts to generate high-quality
question-answer pairs based on images from the FairFace dataset. The resulting
corpus, called FairFaceGPT, covers a diverse set of attributes including
expression, pose, skin texture, and forensic information. Our experiments
demonstrate that FaceLLM improves the performance of MLLMs on various
face-centric tasks and achieves state-of-the-art performance. This work
highlights the potential of synthetic supervision via language models for
building domain-specialized MLLMs, and sets a precedent for trustworthy,
human-centric multimodal AI systems. FairFaceGPT dataset and pretrained FaceLLM
models are publicly available in the project page.

Motivation: 工业制造中异常样本稀缺限制了现有方法的有效性，现有异常合成方法存在真实性低、掩码对齐不准确和泛化能力差的问题。

Method: GAA采用局部概念分解联合建模异常的语义特征和空间信息，结合自适应多轮异常聚类和区域引导掩码生成策略，确保异常与掩码的精确对齐。

Result: 在MVTec AD和LOCO数据集上的实验表明，GAA在异常合成质量和下游任务（如定位和分类）中表现优异。

Conclusion: GAA通过区域引导和少样本生成，显著提升了异常合成的真实性和对齐精度，为工业制造中的异常检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Anomaly inspection plays a vital role in industrial manufacturing, but the
scarcity of anomaly samples significantly limits the effectiveness of existing
methods in tasks such as localization and classification. While several anomaly
synthesis approaches have been introduced for data augmentation, they often
struggle with low realism, inaccurate mask alignment, and poor generalization.
To overcome these limitations, we propose Generate Aligned Anomaly (GAA), a
region-guided, few-shot anomaly image-mask pair generation framework. GAA
leverages the strong priors of a pretrained latent diffusion model to generate
realistic, diverse, and semantically aligned anomalies using only a small
number of samples. The framework first employs Localized Concept Decomposition
to jointly model the semantic features and spatial information of anomalies,
enabling flexible control over the type and location of anomalies. It then
utilizes Adaptive Multi-Round Anomaly Clustering to perform fine-grained
semantic clustering of anomaly concepts, thereby enhancing the consistency of
anomaly representations. Subsequently, a region-guided mask generation strategy
ensures precise alignment between anomalies and their corresponding masks,
while a low-quality sample filtering module is introduced to further improve
the overall quality of the generated samples. Extensive experiments on the
MVTec AD and LOCO datasets demonstrate that GAA achieves superior performance
in both anomaly synthesis quality and downstream tasks such as localization and
classification.

Result: 测试准确率为96.36%，训练准确率为99.55%。

Conclusion: 该方法在手写天城文字符识别中表现优异，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Handwritten character recognition is getting popular among researchers
because of its possible applications in facilitating technological search
engines, social media, recommender systems, etc. The Devanagari script is one
of the oldest language scripts in India that does not have proper digitization
tools. With the advancement of computing and technology, the task of this
research is to extract handwritten Hindi characters from an image of Devanagari
script with an automated approach to save time and obsolete data. In this
paper, we present a technique to recognize handwritten Devanagari characters
using two deep convolutional neural network layers. This work employs a
methodology that is useful to enhance the recognition rate and configures a
convolutional neural network for effective Devanagari handwritten text
recognition (DHTR). This approach uses the Devanagari handwritten character
dataset (DHCD), an open dataset with 36 classes of Devanagari characters. Each
of these classes has 1700 images for training and testing purposes. This
approach obtains promising results in terms of accuracy by achieving 96.36%
accuracy in testing and 99.55% in training time.

TL;DR: 论文提出CrisisLandMark数据集和CLOSP框架，通过文本对齐光学与SAR图像，提升检索性能54%，并整合地理坐标实现更精准的危机事件检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像检索系统多限于RGB数据，未能利用SAR和多光谱数据的独特物理信息，限制了遥感档案的潜力。

Method: 引入CrisisLandMark数据集（64.7万张图像），开发CLOSP框架，通过对比学习对齐光学与SAR图像嵌入空间，并扩展为GeoCLOSP以整合地理坐标。

Result: CLOSP在检索性能上提升54%，GeoCLOSP在位置依赖任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: 多传感器数据与地理背景的整合对释放遥感档案潜力至关重要。

Abstract: Retrieving relevant imagery from vast satellite archives is crucial for
applications like disaster response and long-term climate monitoring. However,
most text-to-image retrieval systems are limited to RGB data, failing to
exploit the unique physical information captured by other sensors, such as the
all-weather structural sensitivity of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) or the
spectral signatures in optical multispectral data. To bridge this gap, we
introduce CrisisLandMark, a new large-scale corpus of over 647,000 Sentinel-1
SAR and Sentinel-2 multispectral images paired with structured textual
annotations for land cover, land use, and crisis events harmonized from
authoritative land cover systems (CORINE and Dynamic World) and crisis-specific
sources. We then present CLOSP (Contrastive Language Optical SAR Pretraining),
a novel framework that uses text as a bridge to align unpaired optical and SAR
images into a unified embedding space. Our experiments show that CLOSP achieves
a new state-of-the-art, improving retrieval nDGC by 54% over existing models.
Additionally, we find that the unified training strategy overcomes the inherent
difficulty of interpreting SAR imagery by transferring rich semantic knowledge
from the optical domain with indirect interaction. Furthermore, GeoCLOSP, which
integrates geographic coordinates into our framework, creates a powerful
trade-off between generality and specificity: while the CLOSP excels at general
semantic tasks, the GeoCLOSP becomes a specialized expert for retrieving
location-dependent crisis events and rare geographic features. This work
highlights that the integration of diverse sensor data and geographic context
is essential for unlocking the full potential of remote sensing archives.

Conclusion: 研究强调了医学影像AI中公平性的重要性，解缠技术的效果取决于模型选择，需进一步优化以实现公平可靠的医疗解决方案。

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss in working-age
adults. While screening reduces the risk of blindness, traditional imaging is
often costly and inaccessible. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms present
a scalable diagnostic solution, but concerns regarding fairness and
generalization persist. This work evaluates the fairness and performance of
image-trained models in DR prediction, as well as the impact of disentanglement
as a bias mitigation technique, using the diverse mBRSET fundus dataset. Three
models, ConvNeXt V2, DINOv2, and Swin V2, were trained on macula images to
predict DR and sensitive attributes (SAs) (e.g., age and gender/sex). Fairness
was assessed between subgroups of SAs, and disentanglement was applied to
reduce bias. All models achieved high DR prediction performance in diagnosing
(up to 94% AUROC) and could reasonably predict age and gender/sex (91% and 77%
AUROC, respectively). Fairness assessment suggests disparities, such as a 10%
AUROC gap between age groups in DINOv2. Disentangling SAs from DR prediction
had varying results, depending on the model selected. Disentanglement improved
DINOv2 performance (2% AUROC gain), but led to performance drops in ConvNeXt V2
and Swin V2 (7% and 3%, respectively). These findings highlight the complexity
of disentangling fine-grained features in fundus imaging and emphasize the
importance of fairness in medical imaging AI to ensure equitable and reliable
healthcare solutions.

Conclusion: EyeSeg通过不确定性感知的分割方法显著提升了AR/VR中的视线估计性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Human-machine interaction through augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality
(VR) is increasingly prevalent, requiring accurate and efficient gaze
estimation which hinges on the accuracy of eye segmentation to enable smooth
user experiences. We introduce EyeSeg, a novel eye segmentation framework
designed to overcome key challenges that existing approaches struggle with:
motion blur, eyelid occlusion, and train-test domain gaps. In these situations,
existing models struggle to extract robust features, leading to suboptimal
performance. Noting that these challenges can be generally quantified by
uncertainty, we design EyeSeg as an uncertainty-aware eye segmentation
framework for AR/VR wherein we explicitly model the uncertainties by performing
Bayesian uncertainty learning of a posterior under the closed set prior.
Theoretically, we prove that a statistic of the learned posterior indicates
segmentation uncertainty levels and empirically outperforms existing methods in
downstream tasks, such as gaze estimation. EyeSeg outputs an uncertainty score
and the segmentation result, weighting and fusing multiple gaze estimates for
robustness, which proves to be effective especially under motion blur, eyelid
occlusion and cross-domain challenges. Moreover, empirical results suggest that
EyeSeg achieves segmentation improvements of MIoU, E1, F1, and ACC surpassing
previous approaches. The code is publicly available at

Conclusion: EmRACE-3K为提升视觉语言模型的具身推理能力提供了有效工具和基准。

Abstract: Recent advanced vision-language models(VLMs) have demonstrated strong
performance on passive, offline image and video understanding tasks. However,
their effectiveness in embodied settings, which require online interaction and
active scene understanding remains limited. In such scenarios, an agent
perceives the environment from a first-person perspective, with each action
dynamically shaping subsequent observations. Even state-of-the-art models such
as GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro struggle in open-environment
interactions, exhibiting clear limitations in spatial reasoning and
long-horizon planning. To address this gap, we introduce EmRACE-3K, a dataset
of over 3,000 language-guided tasks situated in diverse, photorealistic
environments constructed using Unreal Engine and the UnrealCV-Zoo framework.
The tasks encompass a wide range of embodied challenges, including navigation,
object manipulation, and multi-stage goal execution. Each task unfolds as a
multi-step trajectory, pairing first-person visual observations with high-level
instructions, grounded actions, and natural language rationales that express
the agent's intent at every step. Using EmRACE-3K, we establish a benchmark to
evaluate the embodied reasoning capabilities of VLMs across three key
dimensions: Exploration, Dynamic Spatial-Semantic Reasoning, and Multi-stage
Goal Execution. In zero-shot settings, all models achieve success rates below
20%, underscoring the challenge posed by our benchmark and the current
limitations of VLMs in interactive environments. To demonstrate the utility of
EmRACE-3K, we further fine-tune Qwen2.5-VL-7B using supervised learning
followed by reinforcement learning. This approach yields substantial
improvements across all three challenge categories, highlighting the dataset's
effectiveness in enabling the development of embodied reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: The fashion retail business is centered around the capacity to comprehend
products. Product attribution helps in comprehending products depending on the
business process. Quality attribution improves the customer experience as they
navigate through millions of products offered by a retail website. It leads to
well-organized product catalogs. In the end, product attribution directly
impacts the 'discovery experience' of the customer. Although large language
models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in understanding multimodal
data, their performance on fine-grained fashion attribute recognition remains
under-explored. This paper presents a zero-shot evaluation of state-of-the-art
LLMs that balance performance with speed and cost efficiency, mainly
GPT-4o-mini and Gemini 2.0 Flash. We have used the dataset
DeepFashion-MultiModal (https://github.com/yumingj/DeepFashion-MultiModal) to
evaluate these models in the attribution tasks of fashion products. Our study
evaluates these models across 18 categories of fashion attributes, offering
insight into where these models excel. We only use images as the sole input for
product information to create a constrained environment. Our analysis shows
that Gemini 2.0 Flash demonstrates the strongest overall performance with a
macro F1 score of 56.79% across all attributes, while GPT-4o-mini scored a
macro F1 score of 43.28%. Through detailed error analysis, our findings provide
practical insights for deploying these LLMs in production e-commerce product
attribution-related tasks and highlight the need for domain-specific
fine-tuning approaches. This work also lays the groundwork for future research
in fashion AI and multimodal attribute extraction.

To enhance sensitivity to subtle human motions, a velocity modeling branch is
integrated into the framework, which learns short-term keypoint dis-placement
patterns and improves fine-grained motion representation. We construct a 2D
pose dataset specifically designed for smart home care scenarios and
demonstrate that our method achieves 92.2% accuracy on the PCK@50 metric,
outperforming existing methods by 8.3% in PCK@50 on the self-collected dataset.
Further evaluation on the public MMFi dataset confirms the model's robustness
and effectiveness in 3D pose estimation tasks. The proposed system provides a
reliable and privacy-aware solution for continuous human motion analysis in
indoor environments. Our codes are available in

*Osher Rafaeli,Tal Svoray,Ariel Nahlieli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于提示的单目深度估计框架，用于生成高分辨率数字高程模型（DEM），实现了从30米到30厘米的分辨率提升，并在多种地形中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率高程数据对水文、城市形态和生态系统研究至关重要，但现有方法（如超分辨率和单目深度估计）存在分辨率限制或缺乏全局高程背景。

Method: 利用低分辨率SRTM数据作为提示，结合高分辨率RGB图像，通过微调视觉变换器编码器实现DEM估计、填补和更新。

Result: 框架实现了100倍分辨率提升（30米至30厘米），在三种不同地形中表现优异，误差低于5米，优于SRTM 18%。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于灾害和环境研究，并展示了在大规模区域（如美国和以色列）的可扩展性。所有代码和预训练模型已公开。

Abstract: High-resolution elevation estimations are essential to understand catchment
and hillslope hydrology, study urban morphology and dynamics, and monitor the
growth, decline, and mortality of terrestrial ecosystems. Various deep learning
approaches (e.g., super-resolution techniques, monocular depth estimation) have
been developed to create high-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs).
However, super-resolution techniques are limited by the upscaling factor, and
monocular depth estimation lacks global elevation context, making its
conversion to a seamless DEM restricted. The recently introduced technique of
prompt-based monocular depth estimation has opened new opportunities to extract
estimates of absolute elevation in a global context. We present here a
framework for the estimation of high-resolution DEMs as a new paradigm for
absolute global elevation mapping. It is exemplified using low-resolution
Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) elevation data as prompts and
high-resolution RGB imagery from the National Agriculture Imagery Program
(NAIP). The approach fine-tunes a vision transformer encoder with LiDAR-derived
DEMs and employs a versatile prompting strategy, enabling tasks such as DEM
estimation, void filling, and updating. Our framework achieves a 100x
resolution gain (from 30-m to 30-cm), surpassing prior methods by an order of
magnitude. Evaluations across three diverse U.S. landscapes show robust
generalization, capturing urban structures and fine-scale terrain features with
< 5 m MAE relative to LiDAR, improving over SRTM by up to 18%. Hydrological
analysis confirms suitability for hazard and environmental studies. We
demonstrate scalability by applying the framework to large regions in the U.S.
and Israel. All code and pretrained models are publicly available at:

TL;DR: Hyma提出了一种基于超网络的多模态模型对齐方法，显著降低了最优单模态模型选择和连接器训练的计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过训练连接器模块对齐单模态模型，但计算成本高且难以扩展。

Method: 利用超网络的参数预测能力，为多种单模态模型组合联合训练连接器模块。

Result: Hyma将最优模型对搜索成本降低10倍，同时性能与网格搜索相当。

Conclusion: Hyma是一种高效的多模态模型对齐解决方案。

Abstract: Foundation multi-modal models are often designed by stitching of multiple
existing pretrained uni-modal models: for example, an image classifier with an
autoregressive text model. This stitching process is performed by training a
connector module that aims to align the representation-representation or
representation-input spaces of these uni-modal models. However, given the
complexity of training such connectors on large scale web-based datasets
coupled with the ever-increasing number of available pretrained uni-modal
models, the task of uni-modal models selection and subsequent connector module
training becomes computationally demanding. To address this under-studied
critical problem, we propose Hypernetwork Model Alignment (Hyma), a novel
all-in-one solution for optimal uni-modal model selection and connector
training by leveraging hypernetworks. Specifically, our framework utilizes the
parameter prediction capability of a hypernetwork to obtain jointly trained
connector modules for $N \times M$ combinations of uni-modal models. In our
experiments, Hyma reduces the optimal uni-modal model pair search cost by
$10\times$ (averaged across all experiments), while matching the ranking and
trained connector performance obtained via grid search across a suite of
diverse multi-modal benchmarks.

Abstract: Experiment commentary is crucial in describing the experimental procedures,
delving into underlying scientific principles, and incorporating
content-related safety guidelines. In practice, human teachers rely heavily on
subject-specific expertise and invest significant time preparing such
commentary. To address this challenge, we introduce the task of automatic
commentary generation across multi-discipline scientific experiments. While
recent progress in large multimodal models (LMMs) has demonstrated promising
capabilities in video understanding and reasoning, their ability to generate
fine-grained and insightful experiment commentary remains largely
underexplored. In this paper, we make the following contributions: (i) We
construct \textit{ExpInstruct}, the first dataset tailored for experiment
commentary generation, featuring over 7\textit{K} step-level commentaries
across 21 scientific subjects from 3 core disciplines (\ie, science, healthcare
and engineering). Each sample includes procedural descriptions along with
potential scientific principles (\eg, chemical equations and physical laws) and
safety guidelines. (ii) We propose ExpStar, an automatic experiment commentary
generation model that leverages a retrieval-augmented mechanism to adaptively
access, evaluate, and utilize external knowledge. (iii) Extensive experiments
show that our ExpStar substantially outperforms 14 leading LMMs, which
highlights the superiority of our dataset and model. We believe that ExpStar
holds great potential for advancing AI-assisted scientific experiment
instruction.

Conclusion: 该方法为低资源农业环境提供了一种高效、可解释且可扩展的疾病检测方案。

Abstract: Poultry farming is a vital component of the global food supply chain, yet it
remains highly vulnerable to infectious diseases such as coccidiosis,
salmonellosis, and Newcastle disease. This study proposes a lightweight machine
learning-based approach to detect these diseases by analyzing poultry fecal
images. We utilize multi-color space feature extraction (RGB, HSV, LAB) and
explore a wide range of color, texture, and shape-based descriptors, including
color histograms, local binary patterns (LBP), wavelet transforms, and edge
detectors. Through a systematic ablation study and dimensionality reduction
using PCA and XGBoost feature selection, we identify a compact global feature
set that balances accuracy and computational efficiency. An artificial neural
network (ANN) classifier trained on these features achieved 95.85% accuracy
while requiring no GPU and only 638 seconds of execution time in Google Colab.
Compared to deep learning models such as Xception and MobileNetV3, our proposed
model offers comparable accuracy with drastically lower resource usage. This
work demonstrates a cost-effective, interpretable, and scalable alternative to
deep learning for real-time poultry disease detection in low-resource
agricultural settings.

Result: 令牌压缩对通用ViT有效，但在紧凑型ViT上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 研究为未来紧凑型ViT的令牌优化技术提供了方向。

Abstract: Token compression techniques have recently emerged as powerful tools for
accelerating Vision Transformer (ViT) inference in computer vision. Due to the
quadratic computational complexity with respect to the token sequence length,
these methods aim to remove less informative tokens before the attention layers
to improve inference throughput. While numerous studies have explored various
accuracy-efficiency trade-offs on large-scale ViTs, two critical gaps remain.
First, there is a lack of unified survey that systematically categorizes and
compares token compression approaches based on their core strategies (e.g.,
pruning, merging, or hybrid) and deployment settings (e.g., fine-tuning vs.
plug-in). Second, most benchmarks are limited to standard ViT models (e.g.,
ViT-B, ViT-L), leaving open the question of whether such methods remain
effective when applied to structurally compressed transformers, which are
increasingly deployed on resource-constrained edge devices. To address these
gaps, we present the first systematic taxonomy and comparative study of token
compression methods, and we evaluate representative techniques on both standard
and compact ViT architectures. Our experiments reveal that while token
compression methods are effective for general-purpose ViTs, they often
underperform when directly applied to compact designs. These findings not only
provide practical insights but also pave the way for future research on
adapting token optimization techniques to compact transformer-based networks
for edge AI and AI agent applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的变分分数蒸馏方法（$L^2$-VSD），通过线性化模型解决传统VSD中的收敛问题和不稳定性。


<details>

Motivation: 传统VSD方法在实践中存在收敛慢和梯度不稳定的问题，论文旨在通过优化分数模型与3D模型的交互来解决这些问题。

Method: 提出线性化前瞻变分分数蒸馏（$L^2$-VSD），通过调整优化顺序和使用线性化模型改进梯度修正。

Result: 实验证明$L^2$-VSD在生成质量和稳定性上优于现有方法，并能无缝集成到其他VSD框架中。

Conclusion: $L^2$-VSD是一种高效且稳定的文本到3D生成方法，解决了传统VSD的局限性。

Abstract: Text-to-3D generation based on score distillation of pre-trained 2D diffusion
models has gained increasing interest, with variational score distillation
(VSD) as a remarkable example. VSD proves that vanilla score distillation can
be improved by introducing an extra score-based model, which characterizes the
distribution of images rendered from 3D models, to correct the distillation
gradient. Despite the theoretical foundations, VSD, in practice, is likely to
suffer from slow and sometimes ill-posed convergence. In this paper, we perform
an in-depth investigation of the interplay between the introduced score model
and the 3D model, and find that there exists a mismatching problem between LoRA
and 3D distributions in practical implementation. We can simply adjust their
optimization order to improve the generation quality. By doing so, the score
model looks ahead to the current 3D state and hence yields more reasonable
corrections. Nevertheless, naive lookahead VSD may suffer from unstable
training in practice due to the potential over-fitting. To address this, we
propose to use a linearized variant of the model for score distillation, giving
rise to the Linearized Lookahead Variational Score Distillation ($L^2$-VSD).
$L^2$-VSD can be realized efficiently with forward-mode autodiff
functionalities of existing deep learning libraries. Extensive experiments
validate the efficacy of $L^2$-VSD, revealing its clear superiority over prior
score distillation-based methods. We also show that our method can be
seamlessly incorporated into any other VSD-based text-to-3D framework.

Motivation: 现有方法无法处理现实拼图中碎片的几何特性，或依赖碎片形状的限制。

Result: 在RePAIR 2D数据集上实现了最先进的邻域级精度和召回率。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了碎片兼容性计算的性能，适用于考古拼图等实际应用。

Abstract: Pairwise compatibility calculation is at the core of most
fragments-reconstruction algorithms, in particular those designed to solve
different types of the jigsaw puzzle problem. However, most existing approaches
fail, or aren't designed to deal with fragments of realistic geometric
properties one encounters in real-life puzzles. And in all other cases,
compatibility methods rely strongly on the restricted shapes of the fragments.
In this paper, we propose an efficient hybrid (geometric and pictorial)
approach for computing the optimal alignment for pairs of fragments, without
any assumptions about their shapes, dimensions, or pictorial content. We
introduce a new image fragments dataset generated via a novel method for image
fragmentation and a formal erosion model that mimics real-world archaeological
erosion, along with evaluation metrics for the compatibility task. We then
embed our proposed compatibility into an archaeological puzzle-solving
framework and demonstrate state-of-the-art neighborhood-level precision and
recall on the RePAIR 2D dataset, directly reflecting compatibility performance
improvements.

Abstract: Accurate motion estimation for tracking deformable tissues in
echocardiography is essential for precise cardiac function measurements. While
traditional methods like block matching or optical flow struggle with intricate
cardiac motion, modern point tracking approaches remain largely underexplored
in this domain. This work investigates the potential of state-of-the-art (SOTA)
point tracking methods for ultrasound, with a focus on echocardiography.
Although these novel approaches demonstrate strong performance in general
videos, their effectiveness and generalizability in echocardiography remain
limited. By analyzing cardiac motion throughout the heart cycle in real B-mode
ultrasound videos, we identify that a directional motion bias across different
views is affecting the existing training strategies. To mitigate this, we
refine the training procedure and incorporate a set of tailored augmentations
to reduce the bias and enhance tracking robustness and generalization through
impartial cardiac motion. We also propose a lightweight network leveraging
multi-scale cost volumes from spatial context alone to challenge the advanced
spatiotemporal point tracking models. Experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning
with our strategies significantly improves models' performances over their
baselines, even for out-of-distribution (OOD) cases. For instance, EchoTracker
boosts overall position accuracy by 60.7% and reduces median trajectory error
by 61.5% across heart cycle phases. Interestingly, several point tracking
models fail to outperform our proposed simple model in terms of tracking
accuracy and generalization, reflecting their limitations when applied to
echocardiography. Nevertheless, clinical evaluation reveals that these methods
improve GLS measurements, aligning more closely with expert-validated,
semi-automated tools and thus demonstrating better reproducibility in
real-world applications.

Motivation: 现有基于负标签的方法（如NegLabel和CSP）在区分OOD样本时存在误判ID样本为OOD的问题，且难以处理匹配多个标签的图像。

Method: NegRefine通过过滤子类别标签和专有名词，并引入动态调整多标签匹配贡献的评分函数，优化负标签集。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K等大规模基准测试中验证了NegRefine的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: NegRefine显著提升了零样本OOD检测的准确性，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Vision-Language Models like CLIP have enabled
zero-shot OOD detection by leveraging both image and textual label information.
Among these, negative label-based methods such as NegLabel and CSP have shown
promising results by utilizing a lexicon of words to define negative labels for
distinguishing OOD samples. However, these methods suffer from detecting
in-distribution samples as OOD due to negative labels that are subcategories of
in-distribution labels or proper nouns. They also face limitations in handling
images that match multiple in-distribution and negative labels. We propose
NegRefine, a novel negative label refinement framework for zero-shot OOD
detection. By introducing a filtering mechanism to exclude subcategory labels
and proper nouns from the negative label set and incorporating a
multi-matching-aware scoring function that dynamically adjusts the
contributions of multiple labels matching an image, NegRefine ensures a more
robust separation between in-distribution and OOD samples. We evaluate
NegRefine on large-scale benchmarks, including ImageNet-1K. Source code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏标准化基准来定量评估MLLMs在涉及VRUs的复杂、安全关键场景中的推理能力，因此提出了VRU-Accident。

Method: VRU-Accident包含1K真实世界事故视频，标注了6K多选题对和1K密集场景描述，专注于VRU-车辆事故的时空动态和因果语义。

Result: 评估了17个先进MLLMs，发现其在视觉基础属性上表现良好，但在事故原因、类型和可预防性推理方面存在显著挑战。

Conclusion: VRU-Accident填补了MLLMs在安全关键场景评估的空白，揭示了其在复杂推理任务中的不足。

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of vulnerable road users (VRUs), such as pedestrians and
cyclists, is a critical challenge for autonomous driving systems, as crashes
involving VRUs often result in severe or fatal consequences. While multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) have shown promise in enhancing scene
understanding and decision making in autonomous vehicles, there is currently no
standardized benchmark to quantitatively evaluate their reasoning abilities in
complex, safety-critical scenarios involving VRUs. To address this gap, we
present VRU-Accident, a large-scale vision-language benchmark designed to
evaluate MLLMs in high-risk traffic scenarios involving VRUs. VRU-Accident
comprises 1K real-world dashcam accident videos, annotated with 6K
multiple-choice question-answer pairs across six safety-critical categories
(with 24K candidate options and 3.4K unique answer choices), as well as 1K
dense scene descriptions. Unlike prior works, our benchmark focuses explicitly
on VRU-vehicle accidents, providing rich, fine-grained annotations that capture
both spatial-temporal dynamics and causal semantics of accidents. To assess the
current landscape of MLLMs, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 17
state-of-the-art models on the multiple-choice VQA task and on the dense
captioning task. Our findings reveal that while MLLMs perform reasonably well
on visually grounded attributes, they face significant challenges in reasoning
and describing accident causes, types, and preventability.

Motivation: MLLM在高分辨率图像上表现不佳，因固定分辨率的训练导致泛化能力差，降采样又损失细节。

Result: 在4K GUI grounding和4K、8K MLLM感知任务上分别提升21.3%、5.8%、5.2%。

Conclusion: ECP有效解决了MLLM在高分辨率图像上的性能问题，同时保留细节。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in vision-language understanding, reasoning, and generation.
However, they struggle with tasks requiring fine-grained localization and
reasoning in high-resolution images. This constraint stems from the fact that
MLLMs are fine-tuned with fixed image resolution to align with the pre-trained
image encoder used in MLLM. Consequently, feeding high-resolution images
directly into MLLMs leads to poor generalization due to a train-test resolution
discrepancy, while downsampling these images-although ensuring
consistency-compromises fine-grained visual details and ultimately degrades
performance. To address this challenge, we propose Extract Candidate then
Predict (ECP), a novel training-free, task-agnostic two-stage framework
designed to enhance MLLM performance on high-resolution images. The key
intuition behind ECP is that while MLLMs struggle with high-resolution images,
their predictions on downsampled images still contain implicit localization
cues. By first identifying candidate region using the coarse prediction and
then predicting the final output based on candidate region, ECP effectively
preserves fine-grained details while mitigating the challenges posed by
high-resolution data. We validate our framework on 4K GUI grounding and 4K, 8K
MLLM perception, achieving +21.3%, +5.8%, +5.2% absolute improvement compared
to baseline respectively, demonstrating its effectiveness. Code is available at

Result: 点变换器模型在解释人类表现上优于卷积模型，因其支持3D形状的层次抽象。

Conclusion: 点变换器模型更接近人类的3D形状表征方式。

Abstract: Both humans and deep learning models can recognize objects from 3D shapes
depicted with sparse visual information, such as a set of points randomly
sampled from the surfaces of 3D objects (termed a point cloud). Although deep
learning models achieve human-like performance in recognizing objects from 3D
shapes, it remains unclear whether these models develop 3D shape
representations similar to those used by human vision for object recognition.
We hypothesize that training with 3D shapes enables models to form
representations of local geometric structures in 3D shapes. However, their
representations of global 3D object shapes may be limited. We conducted two
human experiments systematically manipulating point density and object
orientation (Experiment 1), and local geometric structure (Experiment 2).
Humans consistently performed well across all experimental conditions. We
compared two types of deep learning models, one based on a convolutional neural
network (DGCNN) and the other on visual transformers (point transformer), with
human performance. We found that the point transformer model provided a better
account of human performance than the convolution-based model. The advantage
mainly results from the mechanism in the point transformer model that supports
hierarchical abstraction of 3D shapes.

Abstract: Prosthetic legs play a pivotal role in clinical rehabilitation, allowing
individuals with lower-limb amputations the ability to regain mobility and
improve their quality of life. Gait analysis is fundamental for optimizing
prosthesis design and alignment, directly impacting the mobility and life
quality of individuals with lower-limb amputations. Vision-based machine
learning (ML) methods offer a scalable and non-invasive solution to gait
analysis, but face challenges in correctly detecting and analyzing prosthesis,
due to their unique appearances and new movement patterns. In this paper, we
aim to bridge this gap by introducing a multi-purpose dataset, namely ProGait,
to support multiple vision tasks including Video Object Segmentation, 2D Human
Pose Estimation, and Gait Analysis (GA). ProGait provides 412 video clips from
four above-knee amputees when testing multiple newly-fitted prosthetic legs
through walking trials, and depicts the presence, contours, poses, and gait
patterns of human subjects with transfemoral prosthetic legs. Alongside the
dataset itself, we also present benchmark tasks and fine-tuned baseline models
to illustrate the practical application and performance of the ProGait dataset.

dataset, the first large-scale, high-quality dataset designed for audio-visual
dyadic interactive virtual human generation. Totaling over 8,743 hours,
SpeakerVid-5M contains more than 5.2 million video clips of human portraits. It
covers diverse scales and interaction types, including monadic talking,
listening, and dyadic conversations. Crucially, the dataset is structured along
two key dimensions: interaction type and data quality. First, it is categorized
into four types (dialogue branch, single branch, listening branch and
multi-turn branch) based on the interaction scenario. Second, it is stratified
into a large-scale pre-training subset and a curated, high-quality subset for
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). This dual structure accommodates a wide array of
2D virtual human tasks. In addition, we provide an autoregressive (AR)-based
video chat baseline trained on this data, accompanied by a dedicated set of
metrics and test data to serve as a benchmark VidChatBench for future work.
Both the dataset and the corresponding data processing code will be publicly
released. Project page: https://dorniwang.github.io/SpeakerVid-5M/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态3D人体表示在虚拟和扩展现实应用中日益重要，但现有方法受限于封闭数据集和长推理时间，适用性受限。

Abstract: Understanding dynamic 3D human representation has become increasingly
critical in virtual and extended reality applications. However, existing human
part segmentation methods are constrained by reliance on closed-set datasets
and prolonged inference times, which significantly restrict their
applicability. In this paper, we introduce the first 4D human parsing framework
that simultaneously addresses these challenges by reducing the inference time
and introducing open-vocabulary capabilities. Building upon state-of-the-art
open-vocabulary 3D human parsing techniques, our approach extends the support
to 4D human-centric video with three key innovations: 1) We adopt mask-based
video object tracking to efficiently establish spatial and temporal
correspondences, avoiding the necessity of segmenting all frames. 2) A novel
Mask Validation module is designed to manage new target identification and
mitigate tracking failures. 3) We propose a 4D Mask Fusion module, integrating
memory-conditioned attention and logits equalization for robust embedding
fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of
the proposed method on 4D human-centric parsing tasks, achieving up to 93.3%
acceleration compared to the previous state-of-the-art method, which was
limited to parsing fixed classes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反事实视觉解释方法忽视因果关系和虚假相关性，导致解释质量受限。

Method: 提出CECAS框架，结合因果视角生成反事实解释，避免虚假因素的干扰。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上优于现有方法，实现有效性、稀疏性、邻近性和真实性的平衡。

Conclusion: CECAS通过因果引导显著提升反事实解释的质量和实用性。

Abstract: Recent work on counterfactual visual explanations has contributed to making
artificial intelligence models more explainable by providing visual
perturbation to flip the prediction. However, these approaches neglect the
causal relationships and the spurious correlations behind the image generation
process, which often leads to unintended alterations in the counterfactual
images and renders the explanations with limited quality. To address this
challenge, we introduce a novel framework CECAS, which first leverages a
causally-guided adversarial method to generate counterfactual explanations. It
innovatively integrates a causal perspective to avoid unwanted perturbations on
spurious factors in the counterfactuals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches across multiple
benchmark datasets and ultimately achieves a balanced trade-off among various
aspects of validity, sparsity, proximity, and realism.

TL;DR: MCGA提出了一种两阶段方法，通过学习光谱模式和RGB-to-HSI映射，结合多尺度VQ-VAE和注意力机制，实现了高效的HSI重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法直接学习RGB-to-HSI映射，忽略了低维到高维转换的固有挑战。

Method: 两阶段方法：1) 多尺度VQ-VAE学习光谱模式；2) 通过查询MoC优化RGB-to-HSI映射，并引入灰度感知和量化自注意力机制。

Result: MCGA在实验中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MCGA通过结合先验知识和物理动机的注意力机制，提供了轻量且高效的HSI重建方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing hyperspectral images (HSI) from RGB images is a cost-effective
solution for various vision-based applications. However, most existing
learning-based hyperspectral reconstruction methods directly learn the
RGB-to-HSI mapping using complex attention mechanisms, neglecting the inherent
challenge of transitioning from low-dimensional to high-dimensional
information. To address this limitation, we propose a two-stage approach, MCGA,
which first learns spectral patterns before estimating the mapping. In the
first stage, a multi-scale VQ-VAE learns representations from heterogeneous HSI
datasets, extracting a Mixture of Codebooks (MoC). In the second stage, the
RGB-to-HSI mapping is refined by querying features from the MoC to replace
latent HSI representations, incorporating prior knowledge rather than forcing a
direct high-dimensional transformation. To further enhance reconstruction
quality, we introduce Grayscale-Aware Attention and Quantized Self-Attention,
which adaptively adjust feature map intensities to meet hyperspectral
reconstruction requirements. This physically motivated attention mechanism
ensures lightweight and efficient HSI recovery. Moreover, we propose an
entropy-based Test-Time Adaptation strategy to improve robustness in real-world
scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method, MCGA, achieves
state-of-the-art performance. The code and models will be released at

Motivation: 珊瑚礁生态系统脆弱且需要持续监测，但珊瑚图像分析需要专业知识，因此需要一种用户友好的交互方式。

Method: 开发了一个半自动数据构建流程，结合海洋生物学家的专业知识，创建了CoralVQA数据集。

Result: 评估了多个先进的大规模视觉语言模型，揭示了关键局限性和机会。

Conclusion: CoralVQA为珊瑚礁图像中的视觉语言推理提供了基准，并支持未来模型的开发，以促进珊瑚保护。

Abstract: Coral reefs are vital yet vulnerable ecosystems that require continuous
monitoring to support conservation. While coral reef images provide essential
information in coral monitoring, interpreting such images remains challenging
due to the need for domain expertise. Visual Question Answering (VQA), powered
by Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), has great potential in user-friendly
interaction with coral reef images. However, applying VQA to coral imagery
demands a dedicated dataset that addresses two key challenges: domain-specific
annotations and multidimensional questions. In this work, we introduce
CoralVQA, the first large-scale VQA dataset for coral reef analysis. It
contains 12,805 real-world coral images from 67 coral genera collected from 3
oceans, along with 277,653 question-answer pairs that comprehensively assess
ecological and health-related conditions. To construct this dataset, we develop
a semi-automatic data construction pipeline in collaboration with marine
biologists to ensure both scalability and professional-grade data quality.
CoralVQA presents novel challenges and provides a comprehensive benchmark for
studying vision-language reasoning in the context of coral reef images. By
evaluating several state-of-the-art LVLMs, we reveal key limitations and
opportunities. These insights form a foundation for future LVLM development,
with a particular emphasis on supporting coral conservation efforts.

Conclusion: 严格旋转等变对航空图像检测器性能有显著提升，MessDet在低参数量下表现优异。

Abstract: Due to the arbitrary orientation of objects in aerial images, rotation
equivariance is a critical property for aerial object detectors. However,
recent studies on rotation-equivariant aerial object detection remain scarce.
Most detectors rely on data augmentation to enable models to learn
approximately rotation-equivariant features. A few detectors have constructed
rotation-equivariant networks, but due to the breaking of strict rotation
equivariance by typical downsampling processes, these networks only achieve
approximately rotation-equivariant backbones. Whether strict rotation
equivariance is necessary for aerial image object detection remains an open
question. In this paper, we implement a strictly rotation-equivariant backbone
and neck network with a more advanced network structure and compare it with
approximately rotation-equivariant networks to quantitatively measure the
impact of rotation equivariance on the performance of aerial image detectors.
Additionally, leveraging the inherently grouped nature of rotation-equivariant
features, we propose a multi-branch head network that reduces the parameter
count while improving detection accuracy. Based on the aforementioned
improvements, this study proposes the Multi-branch head rotation-equivariant
single-stage Detector (MessDet), which achieves state-of-the-art performance on
the challenging aerial image datasets DOTA-v1.0, DOTA-v1.5 and DIOR-R with an
exceptionally low parameter count.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN在遥感图像融合中因卷积核的均匀应用而忽视局部内容变化，限制了性能。

Method: RAPNet采用RAPConv生成空间自适应卷积核，并结合PAN-DFF模块通过注意力机制优化空间细节与光谱保真度的平衡。

Result: 在公开数据集上，RAPNet在定量和定性评估中均优于现有方法，消融实验验证了自适应组件的有效性。

Conclusion: RAPNet通过自适应卷积和动态特征融合，显著提升了遥感图像融合的性能。

Abstract: Pansharpening refers to the process of integrating a high resolution
panchromatic (PAN) image with a lower resolution multispectral (MS) image to
generate a fused product, which is pivotal in remote sensing. Despite the
effectiveness of CNNs in addressing this challenge, they are inherently
constrained by the uniform application of convolutional kernels across all
spatial positions, overlooking local content variations. To overcome this
issue, we introduce RAPNet, a new architecture that leverages content-adaptive
convolution. At its core, RAPNet employs the Receptive-field Adaptive
Pansharpening Convolution (RAPConv), designed to produce spatially adaptive
kernels responsive to local feature context, thereby enhancing the precision of
spatial detail extraction. Additionally, the network integrates the
Pansharpening Dynamic Feature Fusion (PAN-DFF) module, which incorporates an
attention mechanism to achieve an optimal balance between spatial detail
enhancement and spectral fidelity. Comprehensive evaluations on publicly
available datasets confirm that RAPNet delivers superior performance compared
to existing approaches, as demonstrated by both quantitative metrics and
qualitative assessments. Ablation analyses further substantiate the
effectiveness of the proposed adaptive components.

Conclusion: IGD为图形设计提供了新的解决方案，支持灵活编辑和多模态生成。

Abstract: Graphic design visually conveys information and data by creating and
combining text, images and graphics. Two-stage methods that rely primarily on
layout generation lack creativity and intelligence, making graphic design still
labor-intensive. Existing diffusion-based methods generate non-editable graphic
design files at image level with poor legibility in visual text rendering,
which prevents them from achieving satisfactory and practical automated graphic
design. In this paper, we propose Instructional Graphic Designer (IGD) to
swiftly generate multimodal layers with editable flexibility with only natural
language instructions. IGD adopts a new paradigm that leverages parametric
rendering and image asset generation. First, we develop a design platform and
establish a standardized format for multi-scenario design files, thus laying
the foundation for scaling up data. Second, IGD utilizes the multimodal
understanding and reasoning capabilities of MLLM to accomplish attribute
prediction, sequencing and layout of layers. It also employs a diffusion model
to generate image content for assets. By enabling end-to-end training, IGD
architecturally supports scalability and extensibility in complex graphic
design tasks. The superior experimental results demonstrate that IGD offers a
new solution for graphic design.

Motivation: 随着老龄化加剧，老年人跌倒风险增加，及时检测可降低医疗成本和恢复时间，但需兼顾检测系统的有效性和隐私保护。

Method: 提出SF2D（半监督联邦学习跌倒检测系统）、室内定位导航系统和视觉识别系统，通过穿戴设备和边缘设备协同工作。

Result: SF2D准确率99.19%，视觉识别准确率96.3%，结合导航系统（成功率95%），整体准确率达99.99%。

Conclusion: 该框架高效可靠，隐私保护性强，适用于老年人跌倒检测。

Abstract: The aging population is growing rapidly, and so is the danger of falls in
older adults. A major cause of injury is falling, and detection in time can
greatly save medical expenses and recovery time. However, to provide timely
intervention and avoid unnecessary alarms, detection systems must be effective
and reliable while addressing privacy concerns regarding the user. In this
work, we propose a framework for detecting falls using several complementary
systems: a semi-supervised federated learning-based fall detection system
(SF2D), an indoor localization and navigation system, and a vision-based human
fall recognition system. A wearable device and an edge device identify a fall
scenario in the first system. On top of that, the second system uses an indoor
localization technique first to localize the fall location and then navigate a
robot to inspect the scenario. A vision-based detection system running on an
edge device with a mounted camera on a robot is used to recognize fallen
people. Each of the systems of this proposed framework achieves different
accuracy rates. Specifically, the SF2D has a 0.81% failure rate equivalent to
99.19% accuracy, while the vision-based fallen people detection achieves 96.3%
accuracy. However, when we combine the accuracy of these two systems with the
accuracy of the navigation system (95% success rate), our proposed framework
creates a highly reliable performance for fall detection, with an overall
accuracy of 99.99%. Not only is the proposed framework safe for older adults,
but it is also a privacy-preserving solution for detecting falls.

Method: Crucial-Diff包含两个模块：SAFE（统一特征提取器）和WASM（基于下游模型反馈生成难检测样本），两者结合生成高质量训练数据。

Result: 在MVTec上达到83.63%的像素级AP和78.12%的F1-MAX；在息肉数据集上达到81.64%的mIoU和87.69%的mDice。

Conclusion: Crucial-Diff能有效生成多样且高质量的样本，显著提升下游任务性能。

Abstract: The scarcity of data in various scenarios, such as medical, industry and
autonomous driving, leads to model overfitting and dataset imbalance, thus
hindering effective detection and segmentation performance. Existing studies
employ the generative models to synthesize more training samples to mitigate
data scarcity. However, these synthetic samples are repetitive or simplistic
and fail to provide "crucial information" that targets the downstream model's
weaknesses. Additionally, these methods typically require separate training for
different objects, leading to computational inefficiencies. To address these
issues, we propose Crucial-Diff, a domain-agnostic framework designed to
synthesize crucial samples. Our method integrates two key modules. The Scene
Agnostic Feature Extractor (SAFE) utilizes a unified feature extractor to
capture target information. The Weakness Aware Sample Miner (WASM) generates
hard-to-detect samples using feedback from the detection results of downstream
model, which is then fused with the output of SAFE module. Together, our
Crucial-Diff framework generates diverse, high-quality training data, achieving
a pixel-level AP of 83.63% and an F1-MAX of 78.12% on MVTec. On polyp dataset,
Crucial-Diff reaches an mIoU of 81.64% and an mDice of 87.69%. Code will be

Method: 通过解耦异常表示（DRA）和正常特征记忆（NFM）结合，提出NFM-DRA方法。

Result: NFM-DRA在性能上优于现有方法，但对某些未见异常仍存在性能下降。

Conclusion: 提出的基准和方法为视网膜异常检测提供了更全面的评估和改进方向。

Abstract: Retinal anomaly detection plays a pivotal role in screening ocular and
systemic diseases. Despite its significance, progress in the field has been
hindered by the absence of a comprehensive and publicly available benchmark,
which is essential for the fair evaluation and advancement of methodologies.
Due to this limitation, previous anomaly detection work related to retinal
images has been constrained by (1) a limited and overly simplistic set of
anomaly types, (2) test sets that are nearly saturated, and (3) a lack of
generalization evaluation, resulting in less convincing experimental setups.
Furthermore, existing benchmarks in medical anomaly detection predominantly
focus on one-class supervised approaches (training only with negative samples),
overlooking the vast amounts of labeled abnormal data and unlabeled data that
are commonly available in clinical practice. To bridge these gaps, we introduce
a benchmark for retinal anomaly detection, which is comprehensive and
systematic in terms of data and algorithm. Through categorizing and
benchmarking previous methods, we find that a fully supervised approach
leveraging disentangled representations of abnormalities (DRA) achieves the
best performance but suffers from significant drops in performance when
encountering certain unseen anomalies. Inspired by the memory bank mechanisms
in one-class supervised learning, we propose NFM-DRA, which integrates DRA with
a Normal Feature Memory to mitigate the performance degradation, establishing a
new SOTA. The benchmark is publicly available at

Conclusion: 该方法扩展了4D-STEM的能力，为辐射敏感材料的结构分析提供了一种通用性强的新方法。

Abstract: While electron microscopy offers crucial atomic-resolution insights into
structure-property relationships, radiation damage severely limits its use on
beam-sensitive materials like proteins and 2D materials. To overcome this
challenge, we push beyond the electron dose limits of conventional electron
microscopy by adapting principles from multi-image super-resolution (MISR) that
have been widely used in remote sensing. Our method fuses multiple
low-resolution, sub-pixel-shifted views and enhances the reconstruction with a
convolutional neural network (CNN) that integrates features from synthetic,
multi-angle observations. We developed a dual-path, attention-guided network
for 4D-STEM that achieves atomic-scale super-resolution from ultra-low-dose
data. This provides robust atomic-scale visualization across amorphous,
semi-crystalline, and crystalline beam-sensitive specimens. Systematic
evaluations on representative materials demonstrate comparable spatial
resolution to conventional ptychography under ultra-low-dose conditions. Our
work expands the capabilities of 4D-STEM, offering a new and generalizable
method for the structural analysis of radiation-vulnerable materials.

Motivation: 多视角计算机视觉任务中，相机几何关系对3D感知至关重要，但现有方法未能充分利用这些关系。

Method: 比较了三种相机条件化技术：token级射线图编码、attention级相对位姿编码和提出的PRoPE（捕捉完整相机参数）。

Result: 实验表明，PRoPE在新型视图合成、立体深度估计和空间认知任务中均优于其他方法，且适用于不同场景和模型规模。

Conclusion: PRoPE是一种有效的相机几何条件化方法，适用于多任务和多场景的Transformer模型。

Abstract: Transformers are increasingly prevalent for multi-view computer vision tasks,
where geometric relationships between viewpoints are critical for 3D
perception. To leverage these relationships, multi-view transformers must use
camera geometry to ground visual tokens in 3D space. In this work, we compare
techniques for conditioning transformers on cameras: token-level raymap
encodings, attention-level relative pose encodings, and a new relative encoding
we propose -- Projective Positional Encoding (PRoPE) -- that captures complete
camera frustums, both intrinsics and extrinsics, as a relative positional
encoding. Our experiments begin by showing how relative camera conditioning
improves performance in feedforward novel view synthesis, with further gains
from PRoPE. This holds across settings: scenes with both shared and varying
intrinsics, when combining token- and attention-level conditioning, and for
generalization to inputs with out-of-distribution sequence lengths and camera
intrinsics. We then verify that these benefits persist for different tasks,
stereo depth estimation and discriminative spatial cognition, as well as larger
model sizes.

Conclusion: KPHD-Net通过改进的不确定性估计和多视图融合方法，显著提升了多视图学习的性能。

Abstract: Existing multi-view classification and clustering methods typically improve
task accuracy by leveraging and fusing information from different views.
However, ensuring the reliability of multi-view integration and final decisions
is crucial, particularly when dealing with noisy or corrupted data. Current
methods often rely on Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to estimate uncertainty
of network predictions, ignoring domain gaps between different modalities. To
address this issue, KPHD-Net, based on H\"older divergence, is proposed for
multi-view classification and clustering tasks. Generally, our KPHD-Net employs
a variational Dirichlet distribution to represent class probability
distributions, models evidences from different views, and then integrates it
with Dempster-Shafer evidence theory (DST) to improve uncertainty estimation
effects. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that Proper H\"older divergence
offers a more effective measure of distribution discrepancies, ensuring
enhanced performance in multi-view learning. Moreover, Dempster-Shafer evidence
theory, recognized for its superior performance in multi-view fusion tasks, is
introduced and combined with the Kalman filter to provide future state
estimations. This integration further enhances the reliability of the final
fusion results. Extensive experiments show that the proposed KPHD-Net
outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods in both classification and
clustering tasks regarding accuracy, robustness, and reliability, with
theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: In spite of remarkable potential of the Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) in
image generation, the desired properties and optimal design of the autoencoders
have been underexplored. In this work, we analyze the role of autoencoders in
LDMs and identify three key properties: latent smoothness, perceptual
compression quality, and reconstruction quality. We demonstrate that existing
autoencoders fail to simultaneously satisfy all three properties, and propose
Variational Masked AutoEncoders (VMAEs), taking advantage of the hierarchical
features maintained by Masked AutoEncoder. We integrate VMAEs into the LDM
framework, introducing Latent Diffusion Models with Masked AutoEncoders
(LDMAEs). Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate significantly
enhanced image generation quality and computational efficiency.

Result: 在虚拟和物理实验中，3DGAA将检测mAP从87.21%降至7.38%，显著优于现有方法，并展现出高迁移性。

Conclusion: 3DGAA为自动驾驶感知系统的安全性评估提供了一种实用的对抗攻击框架。

Abstract: Camera-based object detection systems play a vital role in autonomous
driving, yet they remain vulnerable to adversarial threats in real-world
environments. While existing 2D and 3D physical attacks typically optimize
texture, they often struggle to balance physical realism and attack robustness.
In this work, we propose 3D Gaussian-based Adversarial Attack (3DGAA), a novel
adversarial object generation framework that leverages the full 14-dimensional
parameterization of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to jointly optimize geometry
and appearance in physically realizable ways. Unlike prior works that rely on
patches or texture, 3DGAA jointly perturbs both geometric attributes (shape,
scale, rotation) and appearance attributes (color, opacity) to produce
physically realistic and transferable adversarial objects. We further introduce
a physical filtering module to preserve geometric fidelity, and a physical
augmentation module to simulate complex physical scenarios, thus enhancing
attack generalization under real-world conditions. We evaluate 3DGAA on both
virtual benchmarks and physical-world setups using miniature vehicle models.
Experimental results show that 3DGAA achieves to reduce the detection mAP from
87.21% to 7.38%, significantly outperforming existing 3D physical attacks.
Moreover, our method maintains high transferability across different physical
conditions, demonstrating a new state-of-the-art in physically realizable
adversarial attacks. These results validate 3DGAA as a practical attack
framework for evaluating the safety of perception systems in autonomous
driving.

Abstract: Objective: This study aims to support early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease
and detection of amyloid accumulation by leveraging the microstructural
information available in multi-shell diffusion MRI (dMRI) data, using a vision
transformer-based deep learning framework.
  Methods: We present a classification pipeline that employs the Swin
Transformer, a hierarchical vision transformer model, on multi-shell dMRI data
for the classification of Alzheimer's disease and amyloid presence. Key metrics
from DTI and NODDI were extracted and projected onto 2D planes to enable
transfer learning with ImageNet-pretrained models. To efficiently adapt the
transformer to limited labeled neuroimaging data, we integrated Low-Rank
Adaptation. We assessed the framework on diagnostic group prediction
(cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease dementia)
and amyloid status classification.
  Results: The framework achieved competitive classification results within the
scope of multi-shell dMRI-based features, with the best balanced accuracy of
95.2% for distinguishing cognitively normal individuals from those with
Alzheimer's disease dementia using NODDI metrics. For amyloid detection, it
reached 77.2% balanced accuracy in distinguishing amyloid-positive mild
cognitive impairment/Alzheimer's disease dementia subjects from
amyloid-negative cognitively normal subjects, and 67.9% for identifying
amyloid-positive individuals among cognitively normal subjects. Grad-CAM-based
explainability analysis identified clinically relevant brain regions, including
the parahippocampal gyrus and hippocampus, as key contributors to model
predictions.
  Conclusion: This study demonstrates the promise of diffusion MRI and
transformer-based architectures for early detection of Alzheimer's disease and
amyloid pathology, supporting biomarker-driven diagnostics in data-limited
biomedical settings.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of UAV technology and its extensive application in
various fields such as military reconnaissance, environmental monitoring, and
logistics, achieving efficient and accurate Anti-UAV tracking has become
essential. The importance of Anti-UAV tracking is increasingly prominent,
especially in scenarios such as public safety, border patrol, search and

and current challenges of Anti-UAV detection and tracking technologies. Next,
it investigates and compiles several publicly available datasets, providing
accessible links to support researchers in efficiently addressing related
challenges. Furthermore, the paper analyzes the major vision-based and
vision-fusion-based Anti-UAV detection and tracking algorithms proposed in
recent years. Finally, based on the above research, this paper outlines future
research directions, aiming to provide valuable insights for advancing the
field.

### [120] [Binomial Self-Compensation: Mechanism and Suppression of Motion Error in Phase-Shifting Profilometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10009)
*Geyou Zhang,Kai Liu,Ce Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图像序列的二项式自补偿方法（I-BSC），解决了传统相位移动轮廓术（PSP）在动态测量中的运动误差问题，同时降低了计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PSP在动态测量中因物体运动导致误差，现有方法P-BSC虽有效但计算开销大且存在误差累积。

Method: I-BSC通过加权求和同质条纹图像而非相位帧，仅需一次反正切计算，显著降低计算复杂度。

Result: I-BSC在减少运动误差的同时实现准单帧速率，计算帧速率提升数倍至数十倍，且误差收敛更快。

Conclusion: I-BSC优于现有方法，适用于高像素-深度-时间分辨率的3D重建。

Abstract: Phase shifting profilometry (PSP) is widely used in high-precision 3D
scanning due to its high accuracy, robustness, and pixel-wise handling.
However, a fundamental assumption of PSP that the object should remain static
does not hold in dynamic measurement, making PSP susceptible to object motion.
To address this challenge, our proposed solution, phase-sequential binomial
self-compensation (P-BSC), sums successive motion-affected phase frames
weighted by binomial coefficients. This approach exponentially reduces the
motion error in a pixel-wise and frame-wise loopable manner. Despite its
efficacy, P-BSC suffers from high computational overhead and error accumulation
due to its reliance on multi-frame phase calculations and weighted summations.
Inspired by P-BSC, we propose an image-sequential binomial self-compensation
(I-BSC) to weight sum the homogeneous fringe images instead of successive phase
frames, which generalizes the BSC concept from phase sequences to image
sequences. I-BSC computes the arctangent function only once, resolving both
limitations in P-BSC. Extensive analysis, simulations, and experiments show
that 1) the proposed BSC outperforms existing methods in reducing motion error
while achieving a quasi-single-shot frame rate, i.e., depth map frame rate
equals to the camera's acquisition rate, enabling 3D reconstruction with high
pixel-depth-temporal resolution; 2) compared to P-BSC, our I-BSC reduces the
computational complexity by one polynomial order, thereby accelerating the
computational frame rate by several to dozen times, while also reaching faster
motion error convergence.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种选择性优化框架，结合低分辨率图像的反向传播（BP-low）和高分辨率图像的零阶优化（ZO-high），以实现内存高效且高质量的文本到图像扩散模型个性化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在边缘设备上适应文本到图像扩散模型时的内存效率和隐私保护问题。

Method: 通过时间步感知的概率函数动态选择BP-low或ZO-high优化策略，结合两者的优势。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在显著降低内存消耗的同时保持了竞争力，实现了高质量的设备端个性化。

Conclusion: 该框架为内存高效的模型个性化提供了有效解决方案，适用于资源受限的设备。

Abstract: Memory-efficient personalization is critical for adapting text-to-image
diffusion models while preserving user privacy and operating within the limited
computational resources of edge devices. To this end, we propose a selective
optimization framework that adaptively chooses between backpropagation on
low-resolution images (BP-low) and zeroth-order optimization on high-resolution
images (ZO-high), guided by the characteristics of the diffusion process. As
observed in our experiments, BP-low efficiently adapts the model to
target-specific features, but suffers from structural distortions due to
resolution mismatch. Conversely, ZO-high refines high-resolution details with
minimal memory overhead but faces slow convergence when applied without prior
adaptation. By complementing both methods, our framework leverages BP-low for
effective personalization while using ZO-high to maintain structural
consistency, achieving memory-efficient and high-quality fine-tuning. To
maximize the efficacy of both BP-low and ZO-high, we introduce a timestep-aware
probabilistic function that dynamically selects the appropriate optimization
strategy based on diffusion timesteps. This function mitigates the overfitting
from BP-low at high timesteps, where structural information is critical, while
ensuring ZO-high is applied more effectively as training progresses.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive
performance while significantly reducing memory consumption, enabling scalable,
high-quality on-device personalization without increasing inference latency.

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，mIR@1提升6.50%，mR@1提升7.96%，F值降低8.95%。

Conclusion: LifelongPR有效解决了PCPR中的持续学习问题，提升了模型性能和实用性。

Abstract: Point cloud place recognition (PCPR) plays a crucial role in photogrammetry
and robotics applications such as autonomous driving, intelligent
transportation, and augmented reality. In real-world large-scale deployments of
a positioning system, PCPR models must continuously acquire, update, and
accumulate knowledge to adapt to diverse and dynamic environments, i.e., the
ability known as continual learning (CL). However, existing PCPR models often
suffer from catastrophic forgetting, leading to significant performance
degradation in previously learned scenes when adapting to new environments or
sensor types. This results in poor model scalability, increased maintenance
costs, and system deployment difficulties, undermining the practicality of
PCPR. To address these issues, we propose LifelongPR, a novel continual
learning framework for PCPR, which effectively extracts and fuses knowledge
from sequential point cloud data. First, to alleviate the knowledge loss, we
propose a replay sample selection method that dynamically allocates sample
sizes according to each dataset's information quantity and selects spatially
diverse samples for maximal representativeness. Second, to handle domain
shifts, we design a prompt learning-based CL framework with a lightweight
prompt module and a two-stage training strategy, enabling domain-specific
feature adaptation while minimizing forgetting. Comprehensive experiments on
large-scale public and self-collected datasets are conducted to validate the
effectiveness of the proposed method. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA)
methods, our method achieves 6.50% improvement in mIR@1, 7.96% improvement in
mR@1, and an 8.95% reduction in F. The code and pre-trained models are publicly
available at https://github.com/zouxianghong/LifelongPR.

Abstract: This paper introduces CoSMo, a novel multimodal Transformer for Page Stream

understanding, as it is a necessary first stage for many downstream tasks like
character analysis, story indexing, or metadata enrichment. We formalize PSS
for this unique medium and curate a new 20,800-page annotated dataset. CoSMo,
developed in vision-only and multimodal variants, consistently outperforms
traditional baselines and significantly larger general-purpose vision-language
models across F1-Macro, Panoptic Quality, and stream-level metrics. Our
findings highlight the dominance of visual features for comic PSS
macro-structure, yet demonstrate multimodal benefits in resolving challenging
ambiguities. CoSMo establishes a new state-of-the-art, paving the way for
scalable comic book analysis.

Conclusion: MoVieS通过统一建模和高效训练，为动态场景的视图合成和几何重建提供了新方法。

Abstract: We present MoVieS, a novel feed-forward model that synthesizes 4D dynamic
novel views from monocular videos in one second. MoVieS represents dynamic 3D
scenes using pixel-aligned grids of Gaussian primitives, explicitly supervising
their time-varying motion. This allows, for the first time, the unified
modeling of appearance, geometry and motion, and enables view synthesis,
reconstruction and 3D point tracking within a single learning-based framework.
By bridging novel view synthesis with dynamic geometry reconstruction, MoVieS
enables large-scale training on diverse datasets with minimal dependence on
task-specific supervision. As a result, it also naturally supports a wide range
of zero-shot applications, such as scene flow estimation and moving object
segmentation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and efficiency
of MoVieS across multiple tasks, achieving competitive performance while
offering several orders of magnitude speedups.

Conclusion: 通过频率域调节机制，论文有效解决了扩散模型的曝光偏差问题，提升了生成质量，为相关研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Diffusion models exhibit impressive generative capabilities but are
significantly impacted by exposure bias. In this paper, we make a key
observation: the energy of the predicted noisy images decreases during the
diffusion process. Building on this, we identify two important findings: 1) The
reduction in energy follows distinct patterns in the low-frequency and
high-frequency subbands; 2) This energy reduction results in amplitude
variations between the network-reconstructed clean data and the real clean
data. Based on the first finding, we introduce a frequency-domain regulation
mechanism utilizing wavelet transforms, which separately adjusts the low- and
high-frequency subbands. Leveraging the second insight, we provide a more
accurate analysis of exposure bias in the two subbands. Our method is
training-free and plug-and-play, significantly improving the generative quality
of various diffusion models and providing a robust solution to exposure bias
across different model architectures. The source code is available at

Conclusion: 该策略有效解决了领域差异导致的性能下降，为数据稀缺且环境独特的遥感场景提供了高精度信息提取的技术范例。

Abstract: To address the prevalent challenges of domain shift and small sample sizes in
remote sensing image water body segmentation, this study proposes and validates
a two-stage transfer learning strategy based on the SegFormer model. The
approach begins by training a foundational segmentation model on a diverse
source domain, where it achieves an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 68.80% on
its validation set, followed by fine-tuning on data from the distinct target
domain. Focusing on the Zhada Tulin area in Tibet -- a region characterized by
highly complex topography and spectral features -- the experimental results
demonstrate that this strategy significantly boosts the IoU for the water body
segmentation task from 25.50% (for direct transfer) to 64.84%. This not only
effectively resolves the model performance degradation caused by domain
discrepancy but also provides an effective technical paradigm for
high-precision thematic information extraction in data-scarce and
environmentally unique remote sensing scenarios.

Abstract: CLIP has shown promising performance across many short-text tasks in a
zero-shot manner. However, limited by the input length of the text encoder,
CLIP struggles on under-stream tasks with long-text inputs (>77 tokens). To
remedy this issue, we propose FIX-CLIP which includes three novel modules: (1)
A dual-branch training pipeline that aligns short and long texts with masked
and raw images respectively, which boosts the long-text representation while
preserving the short-text ability. (2) Multiple learnable regional prompts with
unidirectional masks in Transformer layers for regional information extraction.
(3) A hierarchical feature alignment module in the intermediate encoder layers
to promote the consistency of multi-scale features. Furthermore, we collect 30M
images and utilize existing MLLMs to synthesize long-text captions for
training. Extensive experiments show that FIX-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both long-text and short-text retrieval benchmarks. For
downstream applications, we reveal that FIX-CLIP's text encoder delivers
promising performance in a plug-and-play manner for diffusion models with
long-text input.

Abstract: We propose a multi-camera multi-target (MCMT) tracking framework that ensures
consistent global identity assignment across views using trajectory and
appearance cues. The pipeline starts with BoT-SORT-based single-camera
tracking, followed by an initial glance phase to initialize global IDs via
trajectory-feature matching. In later frames, new tracklets are matched to
existing global identities through a prioritized global matching strategy. New
global IDs are only introduced when no sufficiently similar trajectory or

Conclusion: DEARLi在小样本标注和大分类任务中表现优异，为半监督分割提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Pixel-level annotation is expensive and time-consuming. Semi-supervised
segmentation methods address this challenge by learning models on few labeled
images alongside a large corpus of unlabeled images. Although foundation models
could further account for label scarcity, effective mechanisms for their
exploitation remain underexplored. We address this by devising a novel
semi-supervised panoptic approach fueled by two dedicated foundation models. We
enhance recognition by complementing unsupervised mask-transformer consistency
with zero-shot classification of CLIP features. We enhance localization by
class-agnostic decoder warm-up with respect to SAM pseudo-labels. The resulting
decoupled enhancement of recognition and localization (DEARLi) particularly
excels in the most challenging semi-supervised scenarios with large taxonomies
and limited labeled data. Moreover, DEARLi outperforms the state of the art in
semi-supervised semantic segmentation by a large margin while requiring 8x less
GPU memory, in spite of being trained only for the panoptic objective. We
observe 29.9 PQ and 38.9 mIoU on ADE20K with only 158 labeled images. The

Conclusion: 反馈机制增强了模型的鲁棒性和数据效率，为更适应性和生物启发的神经网络架构提供了方向。

Abstract: While biological vision systems rely heavily on feedback connections to
iteratively refine perception, most artificial neural networks remain purely
feedforward, processing input in a single static pass. In this work, we propose
a predictive coding inspired feedback mechanism that introduces a recurrent
loop from output to input, allowing the model to refine its internal state over
time. We implement this mechanism within a standard U-Net architecture and
introduce two biologically motivated operations, softmax projection and
exponential decay, to ensure stability of the feedback loop. Through controlled
experiments on a synthetic segmentation task, we show that the feedback model
significantly outperforms its feedforward counterpart in noisy conditions and
generalizes more effectively with limited supervision. Notably, feedback
achieves above random performance with just two training examples, while the
feedforward model requires at least four. Our findings demonstrate that
feedback enhances robustness and data efficiency, and offer a path toward more
adaptive and biologically inspired neural architectures. Code is available at:

of SlumpGuard as a practical solution for modern concrete quality assurance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于文本的人物检索方法，通过图像和区域级别的域适应技术，解决了合成数据与真实数据之间的域差距问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于隐私问题和手动标注的高成本，合成数据成为预训练模型的常用选择，但其与真实数据之间的域差距（如光照、颜色和视角差异）限制了模型效果。

Method: 提出了一种统一的文本人物检索流程，包含图像级域适应（Domain-aware Diffusion, DaD）和区域级多粒度关系对齐（Multi-granularity Relation Alignment, MRA）。

Result: 在CUHK-PEDES、ICFG-PEDES和RSTPReid数据集上取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: 该方法通过双级别域适应显著提升了文本人物检索的性能，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: In this work, we focus on text-based person retrieval, which aims to identify
individuals based on textual descriptions. Given the significant privacy issues
and the high cost associated with manual annotation, synthetic data has become
a popular choice for pretraining models, leading to notable advancements.
However, the considerable domain gap between synthetic pretraining datasets and
real-world target datasets, characterized by differences in lighting, color,
and viewpoint, remains a critical obstacle that hinders the effectiveness of
the pretrain-finetune paradigm. To bridge this gap, we introduce a unified
text-based person retrieval pipeline considering domain adaptation at both
image and region levels. In particular, it contains two primary components,
i.e., Domain-aware Diffusion (DaD) for image-level adaptation and
Multi-granularity Relation Alignment (MRA) for region-level adaptation. As the
name implies, Domain-aware Diffusion is to migrate the distribution of images
from the pretraining dataset domain to the target real-world dataset domain,
e.g., CUHK-PEDES. Subsequently, MRA performs a meticulous region-level
alignment by establishing correspondences between visual regions and their
descriptive sentences, thereby addressing disparities at a finer granularity.
Extensive experiments show that our dual-level adaptation method has achieved
state-of-the-art results on the CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReid datasets,
outperforming existing methodologies. The dataset, model, and code are
available at https://github.com/Shuyu-XJTU/MRA.

*Shicai Wei,Chunbo Luo,Yang Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种不对称表示学习（ARL）策略，通过不平衡优化提升多模态学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习常因优化不足表现不如单模态学习，现有方法通过梯度平衡解决，但作者认为不平衡学习才是最优。

Method: ARL通过辅助正则化器计算模态预测方差，并基于方差比重新加权优化，同时引入预测偏差最小化泛化误差。

Result: 实验验证了ARL的有效性和通用性。

Conclusion: 不平衡学习在多模态学习中更优，ARL无需额外参数且独立于模型结构。

Abstract: Multimodal learning often encounters the under-optimized problem and may
perform worse than unimodal learning. Existing approaches attribute this issue
to imbalanced learning across modalities and tend to address it through
gradient balancing. However, this paper argues that balanced learning is not
the optimal setting for multimodal learning. With bias-variance analysis, we
prove that imbalanced dependency on each modality obeying the inverse ratio of
their variances contributes to optimal performance. To this end, we propose the
Asymmetric Representation Learning(ARL) strategy to assist multimodal learning
via imbalanced optimization. ARL introduces auxiliary regularizers for each
modality encoder to calculate their prediction variance. ARL then calculates
coefficients via the unimodal variance to re-weight the optimization of each
modality, forcing the modality dependence ratio to be inversely proportional to
the modality variance ratio. Moreover, to minimize the generalization error,
ARL further introduces the prediction bias of each modality and jointly
optimizes them with multimodal loss. Notably, all auxiliary regularizers share
parameters with the multimodal model and rely only on the modality
representation. Thus the proposed ARL strategy introduces no extra parameters
and is independent of the structures and fusion methods of the multimodal
model. Finally, extensive experiments on various datasets validate the
effectiveness and versatility of ARL. Code is available at

Result: 实验揭示了种族偏见对情绪表达的影响，提出的框架能更好地识别种族差异下的微表情。

Conclusion: 种族背景对情绪表达有显著影响，情绪普遍性假设存在过度概括，种族感知框架为微表情研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: How much does ethnicity play its part in emotional expression? Emotional
expression and micro-expression research probe into understanding human
psychological responses to emotional stimuli, thereby revealing substantial
hidden yet authentic emotions that can be useful in the event of diagnosis and
interviews. While increased attention had been provided to micro-expression
analysis, the studies were done under Ekman's assumption of emotion
universality, where emotional expressions are identical across cultures and
social contexts. Our computational study uncovers some of the influences of
ethnic background in expression analysis, leading to an argument that the
emotional universality hypothesis is an overgeneralization from the perspective
of manual psychological analysis. In this research, we propose to investigate
the level of influence of ethnicity in a simulated micro-expression scenario.
We construct a cross-cultural micro-expression database and algorithmically
annotate the ethnic labels to facilitate the investigation. With the ethnically
annotated dataset, we perform a prima facie study to compare mono-ethnicity and
stereo-ethnicity in a controlled environment, which uncovers a certain
influence of ethnic bias via an experimental way. Building on this finding, we
propose a framework that integrates ethnic context into the emotional feature
learning process, yielding an ethnically aware framework that recognises
ethnicity differences in micro-expression recognition. For improved
understanding, qualitative analyses have been done to solidify the preliminary
investigation into this new realm of research. Code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 论文揭示了多模态学习中模态编码器与融合模块的优化冲突，提出了解耦梯度学习（DGL）框架以提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习中存在性能不如单模态的问题，现有方法未能解释主导模态在多模态模型中表现不佳的原因。

Method: 提出DGL框架，通过截断多模态损失的梯度并替换为单模态损失梯度，消除梯度干扰。

Result: 实验证明DGL在多种模态、任务和框架中有效且通用。

Conclusion: DGL通过解耦优化过程，显著提升了多模态模型的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal learning often encounters the under-optimized problem and may have
worse performance than unimodal learning. Existing methods attribute this
problem to the imbalanced learning between modalities and rebalance them
through gradient modulation. However, they fail to explain why the dominant
modality in multimodal models also underperforms that in unimodal learning. In
this work, we reveal the optimization conflict between the modality encoder and
modality fusion module in multimodal models. Specifically, we prove that the
cross-modal fusion in multimodal models decreases the gradient passed back to
each modality encoder compared with unimodal models. Consequently, the
performance of each modality in the multimodal model is inferior to that in the
unimodal model. To this end, we propose a disentangled gradient learning (DGL)
framework to decouple the optimization of the modality encoder and modality
fusion module in the multimodal model. DGL truncates the gradient
back-propagated from the multimodal loss to the modality encoder and replaces
it with the gradient from unimodal loss. Besides, DGL removes the gradient
back-propagated from the unimodal loss to the modality fusion module. This
helps eliminate the gradient interference between the modality encoder and
modality fusion module while ensuring their respective optimization processes.
Finally, extensive experiments on multiple types of modalities, tasks, and
frameworks with dense cross-modal interaction demonstrate the effectiveness and
versatility of the proposed DGL. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Wardrobe Polyptych LoRA的新方法，通过训练LoRA层实现个性化人类图像生成，无需推理时微调，同时保持高保真度和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化人类图像生成需要精确保留属性（如身份、服装细节），现有方法计算成本高且不适用于实时应用。

Method: 训练LoRA层，利用空间参考减少信息丢失，并引入选择性主题区域损失以优化生成图像与文本提示的对齐。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保真度和一致性上显著优于现有技术，实现了真实且保留身份的全身体合成。

Conclusion: Wardrobe Polyptych LoRA无需额外参数，仅需少量训练样本，为个性化人类图像生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent diffusion models achieve personalization by learning specific
subjects, allowing learned attributes to be integrated into generated images.
However, personalized human image generation remains challenging due to the
need for precise and consistent attribute preservation (e.g., identity,
clothing details). Existing subject-driven image generation methods often
require either (1) inference-time fine-tuning with few images for each new
subject or (2) large-scale dataset training for generalization. Both approaches
are computationally expensive and impractical for real-time applications. To
address these limitations, we present Wardrobe Polyptych LoRA, a novel
part-level controllable model for personalized human image generation. By
training only LoRA layers, our method removes the computational burden at
inference while ensuring high-fidelity synthesis of unseen subjects. Our key
idea is to condition the generation on the subject's wardrobe and leverage
spatial references to reduce information loss, thereby improving fidelity and
consistency. Additionally, we introduce a selective subject region loss, which
encourages the model to disregard some of reference images during training. Our
loss ensures that generated images better align with text prompts while
maintaining subject integrity. Notably, our Wardrobe Polyptych LoRA requires no
additional parameters at the inference stage and performs generation using a
single model trained on a few training samples. We construct a new dataset and
benchmark tailored for personalized human image generation. Extensive
experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms existing
techniques in fidelity and consistency, enabling realistic and
identity-preserving full-body synthesis.

Motivation: Reflow在训练中通过确定性耦合改善生成图像质量，但存在分布差距问题，导致快速生成高质量图像受限。

Method: 提出VRFNO框架，结合编码器和神经速度场，引入历史速度项和噪声优化，优化耦合训练。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，VRFNO显著优于Reflow，达到单步和少步生成任务的最优性能。

Conclusion: VRFNO有效解决了Reflow的局限性，提升了生成图像的质量和效率。

Abstract: The Reflow operation aims to straighten the inference trajectories of the
rectified flow during training by constructing deterministic couplings between
noises and images, thereby improving the quality of generated images in
single-step or few-step generation. However, we identify critical limitations
in Reflow, particularly its inability to rapidly generate high-quality images
due to a distribution gap between images in its constructed deterministic
couplings and real images. To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel
alternative called Straighten Viscous Rectified Flow via Noise Optimization
(VRFNO), which is a joint training framework integrating an encoder and a
neural velocity field. VRFNO introduces two key innovations: (1) a historical
velocity term that enhances trajectory distinction, enabling the model to more
accurately predict the velocity of the current trajectory, and (2) the noise
optimization through reparameterization to form optimized couplings with real
images which are then utilized for training, effectively mitigating errors
caused by Reflow's limitations. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic data and
real datasets with varying resolutions show that VRFNO significantly mitigates
the limitations of Reflow, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both
one-step and few-step generation tasks.

TL;DR: Spatial Lifting (SL) 是一种新颖的密集预测方法，通过将输入提升到高维空间并使用高维网络处理，实现了高效且参数更少的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统密集预测方法计算成本高且参数多，SL旨在通过维度提升降低成本和参数数量，同时保持性能。

Method: SL将2D输入提升到高维空间（如3D），并使用高维网络（如3D U-Net）处理，生成结构化输出。

Result: 在19个基准数据集上验证，SL在减少98%参数和降低推理成本的同时，性能与传统方法相当。

Conclusion: SL为密集预测任务提供了一种更高效、准确和可靠的深度学习新范式。

Abstract: We present Spatial Lifting (SL), a novel methodology for dense prediction
tasks. SL operates by lifting standard inputs, such as 2D images, into a
higher-dimensional space and subsequently processing them using networks
designed for that higher dimension, such as a 3D U-Net. Counterintuitively,
this dimensionality lifting allows us to achieve good performance on benchmark
tasks compared to conventional approaches, while reducing inference costs and
significantly lowering the number of model parameters. The SL framework
produces intrinsically structured outputs along the lifted dimension. This
emergent structure facilitates dense supervision during training and enables
robust, near-zero-additional-cost prediction quality assessment at test time.
We validate our approach across 19 benchmark datasets (13 for semantic
segmentation and 6 for depth estimation), demonstrating competitive dense
prediction performance while reducing the model parameter count by over 98% (in
the U-Net case) and lowering inference costs. Spatial Lifting introduces a new
vision modeling paradigm that offers a promising path toward more efficient,
accurate, and reliable deep networks for dense prediction tasks in vision.

Motivation: 解决现有预训练视觉语言模型在检测接近InD数据的OOD样本时仍存在误分类的问题。

Method: 通过迭代修复和上下文提示生成边界对齐的OOD样本，结合噪声调整和负标签特征微调CLIP模型。

Result: 在ImageNet基准测试中，AUROC提升2.80%，FPR95降低11.13%。

Conclusion: SynOOD通过合成边界样本和微调策略，显著提升了OOD检测性能。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models have exhibited remarkable abilities in
detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. However, some challenging OOD
samples, which lie close to in-distribution (InD) data in image feature space,
can still lead to misclassification. The emergence of foundation models like
diffusion models and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offers a
potential solution to this issue. In this work, we propose SynOOD, a novel
approach that harnesses foundation models to generate synthetic, challenging
OOD data for fine-tuning CLIP models, thereby enhancing boundary-level
discrimination between InD and OOD samples. Our method uses an iterative
in-painting process guided by contextual prompts from MLLMs to produce nuanced,
boundary-aligned OOD samples. These samples are refined through noise
adjustments based on gradients from OOD scores like the energy score,
effectively sampling from the InD/OOD boundary. With these carefully
synthesized images, we fine-tune the CLIP image encoder and negative label
features derived from the text encoder to strengthen connections between
near-boundary OOD samples and a set of negative labels. Finally, SynOOD
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale ImageNet benchmark,
with minimal increases in parameters and runtime. Our approach significantly
surpasses existing methods, improving AUROC by 2.80% and reducing FPR95 by
11.13%. Codes are available in https://github.com/Jarvisgivemeasuit/SynOOD.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative technologies presents both unprecedented
creative opportunities and significant challenges, particularly in maintaining
social trust and ensuring the integrity of digital information. Following these
concerns, the challenge of AI-Generated Image Detection (AID) becomes
increasingly critical. As these technologies become more sophisticated, the
quality of AI-generated images has reached a level that can easily deceive even
the most discerning observers. Our systematic evaluation highlights a critical
weakness in current AI-Generated Image Detection models: while they perform
exceptionally well on controlled benchmark datasets, they struggle
significantly with real-world variations. To assess this, we introduce ITW-SM,
a new dataset of real and AI-generated images collected from major social media
platforms. In this paper, we identify four key factors that influence AID
performance in real-world scenarios: backbone architecture, training data
composition, pre-processing strategies and data augmentation combinations. By
systematically analyzing these components, we shed light on their impact on
detection efficacy. Our modifications result in an average AUC improvement of
26.87% across various AID models under real-world conditions.

Conclusion: 风格迁移在语义分割中具有普适性，能有效减少纹理偏置并增强鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent research has investigated the shape and texture biases of deep neural
networks (DNNs) in image classification which influence their generalization
capabilities and robustness. It has been shown that, in comparison to regular
DNN training, training with stylized images reduces texture biases in image
classification and improves robustness with respect to image corruptions. In an
effort to advance this line of research, we examine whether style transfer can
likewise deliver these two effects in semantic segmentation. To this end, we
perform style transfer with style varying across artificial image areas. Those
random areas are formed by a chosen number of Voronoi cells. The resulting
style-transferred data is then used to train semantic segmentation DNNs with
the objective of reducing their dependence on texture cues while enhancing
their reliance on shape-based features. In our experiments, it turns out that
in semantic segmentation, style transfer augmentation reduces texture bias and
strongly increases robustness with respect to common image corruptions as well
as adversarial attacks. These observations hold for convolutional neural
networks and transformer architectures on the Cityscapes dataset as well as on
PASCAL Context, showing the generality of the proposed method.

Result: 实验表明，优化的KBA背景能有效攻击多种相机位姿估计模型。

Conclusion: KBA方法在攻击相机位姿估计模型方面具有显著效果。

Abstract: Camera pose estimation is a fundamental computer vision task that is
essential for applications like visual localization and multi-view stereo
reconstruction. In the object-centric scenarios with sparse inputs, the
accuracy of pose estimation can be significantly influenced by background
textures that occupy major portions of the images across different viewpoints.
In light of this, we introduce the Kaleidoscopic Background Attack (KBA), which
uses identical segments to form discs with multi-fold radial symmetry. These
discs maintain high similarity across different viewpoints, enabling effective
attacks on pose estimation models even with natural texture segments.
Additionally, a projected orientation consistency loss is proposed to optimize
the kaleidoscopic segments, leading to significant enhancement in the attack
effectiveness. Experimental results show that optimized adversarial
kaleidoscopic backgrounds can effectively attack various camera pose estimation
models.

Result: 在32个数据集上验证，分类性能显著提升，如细粒度数据集提高1.43%。

Conclusion: FTCFormer通过语义驱动的令牌生成，有效提升了图像分类任务的表现。

Abstract: Transformer-based deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success
across various computer vision tasks, largely attributed to their long-range
self-attention mechanism and scalability. However, most transformer
architectures embed images into uniform, grid-based vision tokens, neglecting
the underlying semantic meanings of image regions, resulting in suboptimal
feature representations. To address this issue, we propose Fuzzy Token
Clustering Transformer (FTCFormer), which incorporates a novel clustering-based
downsampling module to dynamically generate vision tokens based on the semantic
meanings instead of spatial positions. It allocates fewer tokens to less
informative regions and more to represent semantically important regions,
regardless of their spatial adjacency or shape irregularity. To further enhance
feature extraction and representation, we propose a Density Peak
Clustering-Fuzzy K-Nearest Neighbor (DPC-FKNN) mechanism for clustering center
determination, a Spatial Connectivity Score (SCS) for token assignment, and a
channel-wise merging (Cmerge) strategy for token merging. Extensive experiments
on 32 datasets across diverse domains validate the effectiveness of FTCFormer
on image classification, showing consistent improvements over the TCFormer
baseline, achieving gains of improving 1.43% on five fine-grained datasets,
1.09% on six natural image datasets, 0.97% on three medical datasets and 0.55%

Conclusion: IP-FVR在面部视频恢复中具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Face Video Restoration (FVR) aims to recover high-quality face videos from
degraded versions. Traditional methods struggle to preserve fine-grained,
identity-specific features when degradation is severe, often producing
average-looking faces that lack individual characteristics. To address these
challenges, we introduce IP-FVR, a novel method that leverages a high-quality
reference face image as a visual prompt to provide identity conditioning during
the denoising process. IP-FVR incorporates semantically rich identity
information from the reference image using decoupled cross-attention
mechanisms, ensuring detailed and identity consistent results. For intra-clip
identity drift (within 24 frames), we introduce an identity-preserving feedback
learning method that combines cosine similarity-based reward signals with
suffix-weighted temporal aggregation. This approach effectively minimizes drift
within sequences of frames. For inter-clip identity drift, we develop an
exponential blending strategy that aligns identities across clips by
iteratively blending frames from previous clips during the denoising process.
This method ensures consistent identity representation across different clips.
Additionally, we enhance the restoration process with a multi-stream negative
prompt, guiding the model's attention to relevant facial attributes and
minimizing the generation of low-quality or incorrect features. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that IP-FVR
outperforms existing methods in both quality and identity preservation,
showcasing its substantial potential for practical applications in face video
restoration.

Motivation: 视频MLLM中线性投影器导致语义模糊和时间不一致，而现有方法未能有效解决这一问题。

Method: DisCo包含视觉概念判别器（VCD）和时间焦点校准器（TFC），分别解决语义区分和时间一致性。

Result: 实验表明DisCo在多个视频理解基准上优于现有方法，且具有更高的token效率。

Conclusion: DisCo为视频MLLM提供了一种高效且性能优越的视觉封装解决方案。

Abstract: In video Multimodal Large Language Models (video MLLMs), the visual
encapsulation process plays a pivotal role in converting video contents into
representative tokens for LLM input. While linear projectors are widely
employed for encapsulation, they introduce semantic indistinctness and temporal
incoherence when applied to videos. Conversely, the structure of resamplers
shows promise in tackling these challenges, but an effective solution remains
unexplored. Drawing inspiration from resampler structures, we introduce DisCo,
a novel visual encapsulation method designed to yield semantically distinct and
temporally coherent visual tokens for video MLLMs. DisCo integrates two key
components: (1) A Visual Concept Discriminator (VCD) module, assigning unique
semantics for visual tokens by associating them in pair with discriminative
concepts in the video. (2) A Temporal Focus Calibrator (TFC) module, ensuring
consistent temporal focus of visual tokens to video elements across every video
frame. Through extensive experiments on multiple video MLLM frameworks, we
demonstrate that DisCo remarkably outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods
across a variety of video understanding benchmarks, while also achieving higher
token efficiency thanks to the reduction of semantic indistinctness. The code:

Conclusion: 双视觉编码器框架有效解决了注释依赖问题，提升了手语翻译性能。

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) aims to convert sign language videos into
spoken or written text. While early systems relied on gloss annotations as an
intermediate supervision, such annotations are costly to obtain and often fail
to capture the full complexity of continuous signing. In this work, we propose
a two-phase, dual visual encoder framework for gloss-free SLT, leveraging
contrastive visual-language pretraining. During pretraining, our approach
employs two complementary visual backbones whose outputs are jointly aligned
with each other and with sentence-level text embeddings via a contrastive
objective. During the downstream SLT task, we fuse the visual features and
input them into an encoder-decoder model. On the Phoenix-2014T benchmark, our
dual encoder architecture consistently outperforms its single stream variants
and achieves the highest BLEU-4 score among existing gloss-free SLT approaches.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为IMD的框架，通过预训练扩散模型解决图像特征匹配中的对齐问题，显著提升了多实例场景下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在引入基础模型进行特征匹配时忽略了单图像理解与跨图像理解之间的对齐问题，导致多实例特征匹配效果不佳。

Method: IMD框架包含两部分：1) 使用生成式扩散模型捕捉实例级细节；2) 提出跨图像交互提示模块，促进图像对之间的双向信息交互。

Result: IMD在常用基准测试中达到新SOTA，并在新提出的IMIM基准上提升了12%。

Conclusion: IMD有效解决了基础模型在特征匹配中的对齐问题，显著提升了多实例场景下的性能。

Abstract: Leveraging the vision foundation models has emerged as a mainstream paradigm
that improves the performance of image feature matching. However, previous
works have ignored the misalignment when introducing the foundation models into
feature matching. The misalignment arises from the discrepancy between the
foundation models focusing on single-image understanding and the cross-image
understanding requirement of feature matching. Specifically, 1) the embeddings
derived from commonly used foundation models exhibit discrepancies with the
optimal embeddings required for feature matching; 2) lacking an effective
mechanism to leverage the single-image understanding ability into cross-image
understanding. A significant consequence of the misalignment is they struggle
when addressing multi-instance feature matching problems. To address this, we
introduce a simple but effective framework, called IMD (Image feature Matching
with a pre-trained Diffusion model) with two parts: 1) Unlike the dominant
solutions employing contrastive-learning based foundation models that emphasize
global semantics, we integrate the generative-based diffusion models to
effectively capture instance-level details. 2) We leverage the prompt mechanism
in generative model as a natural tunnel, propose a novel cross-image
interaction prompting module to facilitate bidirectional information
interaction between image pairs. To more accurately measure the misalignment,
we propose a new benchmark called IMIM, which focuses on multi-instance
scenarios. Our proposed IMD establishes a new state-of-the-art in commonly
evaluated benchmarks, and the superior improvement 12% in IMIM indicates our
method efficiently mitigates the misalignment.

Conclusion: QLIP为扩散模型的高效量化提供了新思路，显著提升了资源受限环境下的适用性。

Abstract: Despite the success of diffusion models in image generation tasks such as
text-to-image, the enormous computational complexity of diffusion models limits
their use in resource-constrained environments. To address this, network
quantization has emerged as a promising solution for designing efficient
diffusion models. However, existing diffusion model quantization methods do not
consider input conditions, such as text prompts, as an essential source of
information for quantization. In this paper, we propose a novel quantization
method dubbed Quantization of Language-to-Image diffusion models using text
Prompts (QLIP). QLIP leverages text prompts to guide the selection of bit
precision for every layer at each time step. In addition, QLIP can be
seamlessly integrated into existing quantization methods to enhance
quantization efficiency. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of QLIP in reducing computational complexity and improving the
quality of the generated images across various datasets.

Motivation: 传统方法在平面图墙分割任务中泛化能力不足，FGSSNet通过引入多头部特征提取器来改进。

Conclusion: FGSSNet通过特征引导显著提升了墙分割的泛化能力。

Abstract: We introduce FGSSNet, a novel multi-headed feature-guided semantic
segmentation (FGSS) architecture designed to improve the generalization ability
of wall segmentation on floorplans. FGSSNet features a U-Net segmentation
backbone with a multi-headed dedicated feature extractor used to extract
domain-specific feature maps which are injected into the latent space of U-Net
to guide the segmentation process. This dedicated feature extractor is trained
as an encoder-decoder with selected wall patches, representative of the walls
present in the input floorplan, to produce a compressed latent representation
of wall patches while jointly trained to predict the wall width. In doing so,
we expect that the feature extractor encodes texture and width features of wall
patches that are useful to guide the wall segmentation process. Our experiments
show increased performance by the use of such injected features in comparison
to the vanilla U-Net, highlighting the validity of the proposed approach.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于随机图的适配器方法（VRGAdapter），用于改进视觉语言模型（VLM）中的文本适配器，以更好地捕捉类别描述的多样性和类间关系，并通过不确定性引导的多分支融合（UMF）提升下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有确定性文本适配器无法充分捕捉类别描述的多样性和类间关系，限制了视觉学习任务的性能。

Method: 提出VRGAdapter，利用顶点随机知识图（VRKG）建模类别描述的多样性和类间关系，通过概率消息传播学习上下文感知的分布表示，并采用重参数化采样实现适配器学习。同时引入UMF方案动态集成多个预训练模型。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验验证了VRGAdapter的有效性。

Conclusion: VRGAdapter提供了一种更通用的适配器解决方案，显著提升了视觉语言模型在下游任务中的性能。

Abstract: Textual adapter-based tuning methods have shown significant potential in
transferring knowledge from pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to
downstream tasks. Existing works generally employ the deterministic textual
feature adapter to refine each category textual representation. However, due to
inherent factors such as different attributes and contexts, there exists
significant diversity in textual descriptions for each category. Such
description diversity offers rich discriminative semantic knowledge that can
benefit downstream visual learning tasks. Obviously, traditional deterministic
adapter model cannot adequately capture this varied semantic information. Also,
it is desirable to exploit the inter-class relationships in VLM adapter. To
address these issues, we propose to exploit random graph model into VLM adapter
and develop a novel Vertex Random Graph Adapter (VRGAdapter). VRGAdapter first
models the inherent diverse descriptions of each category and inter-class
relationships of different categories simultaneously by leveraging a Vertex
Random Knowledge Graph (VRKG) model. Then, it employs probabilistic message
propagation on VRKG to learn context-aware distribution representation for each
class node. Finally, it adopts a reparameterized sampling function to achieve
textual adapter learning. Note that, VRGAdapter provides a more general adapter
solution that encompasses traditional graph-based adapter as a special case. In
addition, to enable more robust performance for downstream tasks, we also
introduce a new Uncertainty-guided Multi-branch Fusion (UMF) scheme that
dynamically integrates multiple pre-trained models for ensemble prediction.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实生活中的细粒度目标检测场景中，类别间差异微小，难以区分，而现有零样本目标检测（ZSD）方法主要针对粗粒度对象。本文旨在解决这一挑战。

Method: 提出MSHC方法，基于改进的两阶段检测器，采用多级语义感知嵌入对齐损失，确保视觉与语义空间的紧密耦合。

Result: 在构建的FGZSD-Birds数据集上，MSHC方法表现优于现有ZSD模型。

Conclusion: 本文成功解决了细粒度零样本目标检测问题，并通过实验验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: Zero-shot object detection (ZSD) aims to leverage semantic descriptions to
localize and recognize objects of both seen and unseen classes. Existing ZSD
works are mainly coarse-grained object detection, where the classes are
visually quite different, thus are relatively easy to distinguish. However, in
real life we often have to face fine-grained object detection scenarios, where
the classes are too similar to be easily distinguished. For example, detecting
different kinds of birds, fishes, and flowers.
  In this paper, we propose and solve a new problem called Fine-Grained
Zero-Shot Object Detection (FG-ZSD for short), which aims to detect objects of
different classes with minute differences in details under the ZSD paradigm. We
develop an effective method called MSHC for the FG-ZSD task, which is based on
an improved two-stage detector and employs a multi-level semantics-aware
embedding alignment loss, ensuring tight coupling between the visual and
semantic spaces. Considering that existing ZSD datasets are not suitable for
the new FG-ZSD task, we build the first FG-ZSD benchmark dataset FGZSD-Birds,
which contains 148,820 images falling into 36 orders, 140 families, 579 genera
and 1432 species. Extensive experiments on FGZSD-Birds show that our method
outperforms existing ZSD models.

Result: 实验显示FOCAL显著提升了CLIP和SAM在2D/3D旋转、光照变化和昼夜变化等挑战性变换中的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FOCAL挑战了变换特定训练的必要性，为不变性提供了一种可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world visual perception requires invariance to diverse transformations,
yet current methods rely heavily on specialized architectures or training on
predefined augmentations, limiting generalization. We propose FOCAL, a
test-time, data-driven framework that achieves robust perception by leveraging
internet-scale visual priors from foundation models. By generating and
optimizing candidate transformations toward visually typical, "canonical"
views, FOCAL enhances robustness without re-training or architectural changes.
Our experiments demonstrate improved robustness of CLIP and SAM across
challenging transformations, including 2D/3D rotations, illumination shifts
(contrast and color), and day-night variations. We also highlight potential
applications in active vision. Our approach challenges the assumption that
transform-specific training is necessary, instead offering a scalable path to
invariance. Our code is available at: https://github.com/sutkarsh/focal.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卷积神经网络（CNN）偏向于纹理特征，而TDA能有效描述复杂数据的几何信息，因此尝试结合两者以提升分类效果。

Method: 设计了TDA特征工程流程，并将其与ResNet18结合，应用于EuroSAT和RESISC45数据集。

Result: 在EuroSAT数据集上，准确率提升1.44%至99.33%，超过更大模型；在RESISC45数据集上，比基线高1.82%。

Conclusion: TDA特征能与深度学习模型有效结合，扩展了TDA的适用性，尤其在无显式拓扑结构的数据集上。

Abstract: Topological data analysis (TDA) is a relatively new field that is gaining
rapid adoption due to its robustness and ability to effectively describe
complex datasets by quantifying geometric information. In imaging contexts, TDA
typically models data as filtered cubical complexes from which we can extract
discriminative features using persistence homology. Meanwhile, convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) have been shown to be biased towards texture based local
features. To address this limitation, we propose a TDA feature engineering
pipeline and a simple method to integrate topological features with deep
learning models on remote sensing classification. Our method improves the
performance of a ResNet18 model on the EuroSAT dataset by 1.44% achieving
99.33% accuracy, which surpasses all previously reported single-model
accuracies, including those with larger architectures, such as ResNet50 (2x
larger) and XL Vision Transformers (197x larger). We additionally show that our
method's accuracy is 1.82% higher than our ResNet18 baseline on the RESISC45
dataset. To our knowledge, this is the first application of TDA features in
satellite scene classification with deep learning. This demonstrates that TDA
features can be integrated with deep learning models, even on datasets without
explicit topological structures, thereby increasing the applicability of TDA. A
clean implementation of our method will be made publicly available upon
publication.

Conclusion: SC-AGIQA通过语义约束和频域分析，显著提升了AI生成图像的质量评估效果。

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in Artificial Intelligence Generated Image (AGI)
technology, the accurate assessment of their quality has become an increasingly
vital requirement. Prevailing methods typically rely on cross-modal models like
CLIP or BLIP to evaluate text-image alignment and visual quality. However, when
applied to AGIs, these methods encounter two primary challenges: semantic
misalignment and details perception missing. To address these limitations, we
propose Text-Visual Semantic Constrained AI-Generated Image Quality Assessment
(SC-AGIQA), a unified framework that leverages text-visual semantic constraints
to significantly enhance the comprehensive evaluation of both text-image
consistency and perceptual distortion in AI-generated images. Our approach
integrates key capabilities from multiple models and tackles the aforementioned
challenges by introducing two core modules: the Text-assisted Semantic
Alignment Module (TSAM), which leverages Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) to bridge the semantic gap by generating an image description and
comparing it against the original prompt for a refined consistency check, and
the Frequency-domain Fine-Grained Degradation Perception Module (FFDPM), which
draws inspiration from Human Visual System (HVS) properties by employing
frequency domain analysis combined with perceptual sensitivity weighting to
better quantify subtle visual distortions and enhance the capture of
fine-grained visual quality details in images. Extensive experiments conducted
on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that SC-AGIQA outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods. The code is publicly available at

Conclusion: 4D-Animal具有大规模应用潜力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Existing methods for reconstructing animatable 3D animals from videos
typically rely on sparse semantic keypoints to fit parametric models. However,
obtaining such keypoints is labor-intensive, and keypoint detectors trained on
limited animal data are often unreliable. To address this, we propose
4D-Animal, a novel framework that reconstructs animatable 3D animals from
videos without requiring sparse keypoint annotations. Our approach introduces a
dense feature network that maps 2D representations to SMAL parameters,
enhancing both the efficiency and stability of the fitting process.
Furthermore, we develop a hierarchical alignment strategy that integrates
silhouette, part-level, pixel-level, and temporal cues from pre-trained 2D
visual models to produce accurate and temporally coherent reconstructions
across frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 4D-Animal outperforms
both model-based and model-free baselines. Moreover, the high-quality 3D assets
generated by our method can benefit other 3D tasks, underscoring its potential
for large-scale applications. The code is released at

Result: 在各种骨干模型上表现出优越性能，身份保留能力和参考特征转移质量更好。

Conclusion: RefSTAR方法有效解决了盲人脸图像修复中的身份保留问题。

Abstract: Blind facial image restoration is highly challenging due to unknown complex
degradations and the sensitivity of humans to faces. Although existing methods
introduce auxiliary information from generative priors or high-quality
reference images, they still struggle with identity preservation problems,
mainly due to improper feature introduction on detailed textures. In this
paper, we focus on effectively incorporating appropriate features from
high-quality reference images, presenting a novel blind facial image
restoration method that considers reference selection, transfer, and
reconstruction (RefSTAR). In terms of selection, we construct a reference
selection (RefSel) module. For training the RefSel module, we construct a
RefSel-HQ dataset through a mask generation pipeline, which contains annotating
masks for 10,000 ground truth-reference pairs. As for the transfer, due to the
trivial solution in vanilla cross-attention operations, a feature fusion
paradigm is designed to force the features from the reference to be integrated.
Finally, we propose a reference image reconstruction mechanism that further
ensures the presence of reference image features in the output image. The cycle
consistency loss is also redesigned in conjunction with the mask. Extensive
experiments on various backbone models demonstrate superior performance,
showing better identity preservation ability and reference feature transfer
quality. Source code, dataset, and pre-trained models are available at

Conclusion: GT-Loc通过联合优化时间和地理位置预测，显著提升了性能，并展示了统一嵌入空间的多功能性。

Abstract: Timestamp prediction aims to determine when an image was captured using only
visual information, supporting applications such as metadata correction,
retrieval, and digital forensics. In outdoor scenarios, hourly estimates rely
on cues like brightness, hue, and shadow positioning, while seasonal changes
and weather inform date estimation. However, these visual cues significantly
depend on geographic context, closely linking timestamp prediction to
geo-localization. To address this interdependence, we introduce GT-Loc, a novel
retrieval-based method that jointly predicts the capture time (hour and month)
and geo-location (GPS coordinates) of an image. Our approach employs separate
encoders for images, time, and location, aligning their embeddings within a
shared high-dimensional feature space. Recognizing the cyclical nature of time,
instead of conventional contrastive learning with hard positives and negatives,
we propose a temporal metric-learning objective providing soft targets by
modeling pairwise time differences over a cyclical toroidal surface. We present
new benchmarks demonstrating that our joint optimization surpasses previous
time prediction methods, even those using the ground-truth geo-location as an
input during inference. Additionally, our approach achieves competitive results
on standard geo-localization tasks, and the unified embedding space facilitates
compositional and text-based image retrieval.

Abstract: Deep learning models have been proposed for automatic polyp detection and
precise segmentation of polyps during colonoscopy procedures. Although these
state-of-the-art models achieve high performance, they often require a large
number of parameters. Their complexity can make them prone to overfitting,
particularly when trained on biased datasets, and can result in poor
generalization across diverse datasets. Knowledge distillation and
self-distillation are proposed as promising strategies to mitigate the
limitations of large, over-parameterized models. These approaches, however, are
resource-intensive, often requiring multiple models and significant memory
during training. We propose a confidence-based self-distillation approach that
outperforms state-of-the-art models by utilizing only previous iteration data
storage during training, without requiring extra computation or memory usage
during testing. Our approach calculates the loss between the previous and
current iterations within a batch using a dynamic confidence coefficient. To
evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct comprehensive
experiments on the task of polyp segmentation. Our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art models and generalizes well across datasets collected from
multiple clinical centers. The code will be released to the public once the
paper is accepted.

Abstract: The design of science-based policies to improve the sustainability of
smallholder agriculture is challenged by a limited understanding of fundamental
system properties, such as the spatial distribution of active cropland and
field size. We integrate very high spatial resolution (1.5 m) Earth observation
data and deep transfer learning to derive crop field delineations in complex
agricultural systems at the national scale, while maintaining minimum reference
data requirements and enhancing transferability. We provide the first
national-level dataset of 21 million individual fields for Mozambique (covering
~800,000 km2) for 2023. Our maps separate active cropland from non-agricultural
land use with an overall accuracy of 93% and balanced omission and commission
errors. Field-level spatial agreement reached median intersection over union
(IoU) scores of 0.81, advancing the state-of-the-art in large-area field
delineation in complex smallholder systems. The active cropland maps capture
fragmented rural regions with low cropland shares not yet identified in global
land cover or cropland maps. These regions are mostly located in agricultural
frontier regions which host 7-9% of the Mozambican population. Field size in
Mozambique is very low overall, with half of the fields being smaller than 0.16
ha, and 83% smaller than 0.5 ha. Mean field size at aggregate spatial
resolution (0.05{\deg}) is 0.32 ha, but it varies strongly across gradients of
accessibility, population density, and net forest cover change. This variation
reflects a diverse set of actors, ranging from semi-subsistence smallholder
farms to medium-scale commercial farming, and large-scale farming operations.
Our results highlight that field size is a key indicator relating to
socio-economic and environmental outcomes of agriculture (e.g., food
production, livelihoods, deforestation, biodiversity), as well as their
trade-offs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练高压缩率的VQ-VAE通常需要大量计算资源，ReVQ旨在通过预训练的VAE减少这一需求。

Method: 采用Quantize-then-Rectify框架，结合通道多组量化和后矫正器，以减少量化误差并扩大码本容量。

Result: ReVQ在ImageNet上仅需512个token，重建质量保持竞争力（rFID=1.06），训练成本降低两个数量级。

Conclusion: ReVQ在效率和重建质量之间取得了优越的平衡，显著降低了训练成本。

Abstract: Visual tokenizers are pivotal in multimodal large models, acting as bridges
between continuous inputs and discrete tokens. Nevertheless, training
high-compression-rate VQ-VAEs remains computationally demanding, often
necessitating thousands of GPU hours. This work demonstrates that a pre-trained
VAE can be efficiently transformed into a VQ-VAE by controlling quantization
noise within the VAE's tolerance threshold. We present
\textbf{Quantize-then-Rectify (ReVQ)}, a framework leveraging pre-trained VAEs
to enable rapid VQ-VAE training with minimal computational overhead. By
integrating \textbf{channel multi-group quantization} to enlarge codebook
capacity and a \textbf{post rectifier} to mitigate quantization errors, ReVQ
compresses ImageNet images into at most 512 tokens while sustaining competitive
reconstruction quality (rFID = 1.06). Significantly, ReVQ reduces training
costs by over two orders of magnitude relative to state-of-the-art approaches:
ReVQ finishes full training on a single NVIDIA 4090 in approximately 22 hours,
whereas comparable methods require 4.5 days on 32 A100 GPUs. Experimental
results show that ReVQ achieves superior efficiency-reconstruction trade-offs.

### [162] [Spatial ModernBERT: Spatial-Aware Transformer for Table and Key-Value Extraction in Financial Documents at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08865)
*Javis AI Team,Amrendra Singh,Maulik Shah,Dharshan Sampath*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer的模型Spatial ModernBERT，用于从复杂财务文档中提取表格和键值对，通过空间嵌入和多任务分类实现高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 财务文档中的表格和键值对提取对审计、数据分析等业务流程至关重要，但传统方法难以处理复杂文档。

Method: 采用Spatial ModernBERT模型，结合空间嵌入和多任务分类（标签、列、行头），并通过B-I-IB标记和后处理重建表格布局。

Result: 模型在财务文档数据集上表现优异，能够高效利用文本和空间信息实现高精度提取。

Conclusion: Spatial ModernBERT为财务文档中的表格和键值对提取提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Extracting tables and key-value pairs from financial documents is essential
for business workflows such as auditing, data analytics, and automated invoice
processing. In this work, we introduce Spatial ModernBERT-a transformer-based
model augmented with spatial embeddings-to accurately detect and extract
tabular data and key-value fields from complex financial documents. We cast the
extraction task as token classification across three heads: (1) Label Head,
classifying each token as a label (e.g., PO Number, PO Date, Item Description,
Quantity, Base Cost, MRP, etc.); (2) Column Head, predicting column indices;
(3) Row Head, distinguishing the start of item rows and header rows. The model
is pretrained on the PubTables-1M dataset, then fine-tuned on a financial
document dataset, achieving robust performance through cross-entropy loss on
each classification head. We propose a post-processing method to merge tokens
using B-I-IB tagging, reconstruct the tabular layout, and extract key-value
pairs. Empirical evaluation shows that Spatial ModernBERT effectively leverages
both textual and spatial cues, facilitating highly accurate table and key-value
extraction in real-world financial documents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SEALGuard是一种多语言护栏，旨在提升LLM系统在多语言环境下的安全对齐能力，显著优于现有方法如LlamaGuard。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有护栏（如LlamaGuard）在多语言不安全输入（尤其是低资源语言）上表现不佳，导致LLM系统存在安全漏洞。

Method: 通过低秩适应（LoRA）将通用多语言模型转化为多语言护栏，并构建SEALSBench数据集（26万条多语言提示）。

Result: SEALGuard在多语言不安全提示检测中表现优异，DSR提升48%，优于LlamaGuard。

Conclusion: SEALGuard通过有效多语言护栏提升了LLM系统的安全对齐能力。

Abstract: Safety alignment is critical for LLM-powered systems. While recent
LLM-powered guardrail approaches such as LlamaGuard achieve high detection
accuracy of unsafe inputs written in English (e.g., ``How to create a bomb?''),
they struggle with multilingual unsafe inputs. This limitation leaves LLM
systems vulnerable to unsafe and jailbreak prompts written in low-resource
languages such as those in Southeast Asia. This paper introduces SEALGuard, a
multilingual guardrail designed to improve the safety alignment across diverse
languages. It aims to address the multilingual safety alignment gap of existing
guardrails and ensure effective filtering of unsafe and jailbreak prompts in
LLM-powered systems. We adapt a general-purpose multilingual language model
into a multilingual guardrail using low-rank adaptation (LoRA). We construct
SEALSBench, a large-scale multilingual safety alignment dataset containing over
260,000 prompts in ten languages, including safe, unsafe, and jailbreak cases.
We evaluate SEALGuard against state-of-the-art guardrails such as LlamaGuard on
this benchmark. Our findings show that multilingual unsafe and jailbreak
prompts substantially degrade the performance of the state-of-the-art
LlamaGuard, which experiences a drop in Defense Success Rate (DSR) by 9% and
18%, respectively, compared to its performance on English-only prompts. In
contrast, SEALGuard outperforms existing guardrails in detecting multilingual
unsafe and jailbreak prompts, improving DSR by 48% over LlamaGuard and
achieving the best DSR, precision, and F1-score. Our ablation study further
reveals the contributions of adaptation strategies and model size to the
overall performance of SEALGuard. SEALGuard advances the safety alignment of
LLM systems by introducing an effective multilingual guardrail.

TL;DR: 论文分析了当前用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在医学问答中的数据集局限性，并呼吁建立标准化框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在医学问答中的表现，但现有数据集缺乏临床真实性、透明性和验证过程。

Method: 审查了MedQA、MedMCQA等广泛使用的基准数据集，并分析了医学期刊中的挑战问题。

Result: 现有数据集普遍不足，挑战问题虽有益但规模小、范围窄且可能被LLMs训练数据覆盖。

Conclusion: 需建立标准化框架，并通过合作确保数据集和方法严谨、无偏且反映临床复杂性。

Abstract: Objectives: To evaluate the current limitations of large language models
(LLMs) in medical question answering, focusing on the quality of datasets used
for their evaluation. Materials and Methods: Widely-used benchmark datasets,
including MedQA, MedMCQA, PubMedQA, and MMLU, were reviewed for their rigor,
transparency, and relevance to clinical scenarios. Alternatives, such as
challenge questions in medical journals, were also analyzed to identify their
potential as unbiased evaluation tools. Results: Most existing datasets lack
clinical realism, transparency, and robust validation processes. Publicly
available challenge questions offer some benefits but are limited by their
small size, narrow scope, and exposure to LLM training. These gaps highlight
the need for secure, comprehensive, and representative datasets. Conclusion: A
standardized framework is critical for evaluating LLMs in medicine.
Collaborative efforts among institutions and policymakers are needed to ensure
datasets and methodologies are rigorous, unbiased, and reflective of clinical
complexities.

TL;DR: SIMS是一种无需外部监督的自改进模型引导框架，通过自主生成和优化对比样本，显著提升了大型语言模型（LLM）的引导效果和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型引导方法依赖外部标注数据，限制了其适应性和效果。SIMS旨在通过自改进机制解决这一问题。

Method: SIMS通过迭代自改进循环生成和优化对比样本，并结合提示排名和对比采样等新策略。

Result: SIMS在多样化的LLM和基准测试中表现优于现有方法，展现了更高的引导效果和适应性。

Conclusion: 自改进模型引导是未来LLM推理时对齐研究的一个有前景的方向。

Abstract: Model steering represents a powerful technique that dynamically aligns large
language models (LLMs) with human preferences during inference. However,
conventional model-steering methods rely heavily on externally annotated data,
not only limiting their adaptability to varying contexts but also tethering
their effectiveness to annotation quality. In this paper, we present SIMS, the
first self-improving model-steering framework that operates without relying on
external supervision. At its core, SIMS autonomously generates and refines
contrastive samples through iterative self-improvement cycles, enabling
adaptive, context-specific steering. Additionally, SIMS employs novel
strategies, including prompt ranking and contrast sampling, to further enhance
steering efficacy. Extensive evaluation across diverse LLMs and benchmarks
demonstrates that SIMS substantially outperforms existing methods in steering
effectiveness and adaptability, highlighting self-improving model steering as a
promising direction for future research on inference-time LLM alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨电子健康记录中污名化语言的普遍性及其对不同患者群体的影响。

Method: 通过扩展词典匹配和监督学习分类器识别MIMIC-III EHR中的怀疑标记和污名化标签，并使用泊松回归模型分析预测因素。

Result: 黑人、低收入患者和精神疾病患者的污名化标签率更高；护士和社会工作者的使用频率更高。

Conclusion: 污名化语言在历史上被污名化的患者群体中更常见，且由多种医疗提供者使用，需采取措施减少此类现象。

Abstract: Introduction: Electronic health records (EHR) are a critical medium through
which patient stigmatization is perpetuated among healthcare teams. Methods: We
identified linguistic features of doubt markers and stigmatizing labels in
MIMIC-III EHR via expanded lexicon matching and supervised learning
classifiers. Predictors of rates of linguistic features were assessed using
Poisson regression models. Results: We found higher rates of stigmatizing
labels per chart among patients who were Black or African American (RR: 1.16),
patients with Medicare/Medicaid or government-run insurance (RR: 2.46),
self-pay (RR: 2.12), and patients with a variety of stigmatizing disease and
mental health conditions. Patterns among doubt markers were similar, though
male patients had higher rates of doubt markers (RR: 1.25). We found increased
stigmatizing labels used by nurses (RR: 1.40), and social workers (RR: 2.25),
with similar patterns of doubt markers. Discussion: Stigmatizing language
occurred at higher rates among historically stigmatized patients, perpetuated
by multiple provider types.

Motivation: 探讨视觉想象力差异如何影响Ganzflicker诱导的幻觉内容，验证想象力谱系假说。

Method: 使用自然语言处理工具分析4000多名参与者的自由文本描述，比较不同想象力表型的内容差异。

Result: 强想象力者描述复杂自然内容，弱想象力者描述简单几何模式；视觉语言模型能更好捕捉这些差异。

Conclusion: 结果支持想象力谱系假说，反映早期视觉区与高阶区协调的个体差异。

Abstract: A rapidly alternating red and black display known as Ganzflicker induces
visual hallucinations that reflect the generative capacity of the visual
system. Recent proposals regarding the imagery spectrum, that is, differences
in the visual system of individuals with absent imagery, typical imagery, and
vivid imagery, suggest these differences should impact the complexity of other
internally generated visual experiences. Here, we used tools from natural
language processing to analyze free-text descriptions of hallucinations from
over 4,000 participants, asking whether people with different imagery
phenotypes see different things in their mind's eye during Ganzflicker-induced
hallucinations. Strong imagers described complex, naturalistic content, while
weak imagers reported simple geometric patterns. Embeddings from vision
language models better captured these differences than text-only language
models, and participants with stronger imagery used language with richer
sensorimotor associations. These findings may reflect individual variation in
coordination between early visual areas and higher-order regions relevant for
the imagery spectrum.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Lizard是一个线性化框架，将预训练的Transformer大语言模型转化为支持无限上下文生成的次二次复杂度架构，解决了传统Transformer在长上下文中的内存和计算瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer大语言模型在长上下文生成中面临内存和计算瓶颈，主要由于softmax注意力的二次复杂性和不断增长的KV缓存。Lizard旨在通过次二次注意力机制解决这些问题，同时保持输出质量。

Method: Lizard引入了一种次二次注意力机制，结合了门控模块和滑动窗口注意力，支持全局上下文压缩和局部交互。此外，还提出了硬件感知算法以加速训练。

Result: 实验表明，Lizard在标准语言建模任务中几乎无损地恢复了教师模型的性能，并在MMLU基准和关联召回任务上显著优于之前的线性化方法。

Conclusion: Lizard通过创新的混合注意力机制和硬件优化，实现了高效的长上下文处理，为未来大语言模型的扩展提供了灵活且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose Lizard, a linearization framework that transforms pretrained
Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) into flexible, subquadratic
architectures for infinite-context generation. Transformer-based LLMs face
significant memory and computational bottlenecks as context lengths increase,
due to the quadratic complexity of softmax attention and the growing key-value
(KV) cache. Lizard addresses these limitations by introducing a subquadratic
attention mechanism that closely approximates softmax attention while
preserving the output quality. Unlike previous linearization methods, which are
often limited by fixed model structures and therefore exclude gating
mechanisms, Lizard incorporates a gating module inspired by recent
state-of-the-art linear models. This enables adaptive memory control, supports
constant-memory inference, offers strong length generalization, and allows more
flexible model design. Lizard combines gated linear attention for global
context compression with sliding window attention enhanced by meta memory,
forming a hybrid mechanism that captures both long-range dependencies and
fine-grained local interactions. Moreover, we introduce a hardware-aware
algorithm that accelerates the training speed of our models. Extensive
experiments show that Lizard achieves near-lossless recovery of the teacher
model's performance across standard language modeling tasks, while
significantly outperforming previous linearization methods. On the 5-shot MMLU
benchmark, Lizard improves over prior models by 18 points and shows significant
improvements on associative recall tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM比较工具主要关注基准任务，而用户多样化的价值观和偏好需要新的对齐和个性化方法。

Method: ALIGN系统采用提示对齐方法，支持结构化输出生成、配置管理和可替换的LLM算法实现。

Result: 系统支持定性和定量分析，包括人口统计对齐和医疗分诊决策的价值对齐。

Conclusion: ALIGN框架开源，为可靠、负责任和个性化的LLM决策者研究提供新方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used as decision aids.
However, users have diverse values and preferences that can affect their
decision-making, which requires novel methods for LLM alignment and
personalization. Existing LLM comparison tools largely focus on benchmarking
tasks, such as knowledge-based question answering. In contrast, our proposed
ALIGN system focuses on dynamic personalization of LLM-based decision-makers
through prompt-based alignment to a set of fine-grained attributes. Key
features of our system include robust configuration management, structured
output generation with reasoning, and several algorithm implementations with
swappable LLM backbones, enabling different types of analyses. Our user
interface enables a qualitative, side-by-side comparison of LLMs and their
alignment to various attributes, with a modular backend for easy algorithm
integration. Additionally, we perform a quantitative analysis comparing
alignment approaches in two different domains: demographic alignment for public
opinion surveys and value alignment for medical triage decision-making. The
entire ALIGN framework is open source and will enable new research on reliable,
responsible, and personalized LLM-based decision-makers.

Motivation: 当前代码生成与评价领域依赖大规模高质量数据集，而现有公开数据集规模有限。

Method: 采用两阶段监督微调策略：首阶段专注于代码生成，次阶段联合训练代码生成与评价模型。

Result: 微调后的Qwen2.5-Instruct模型在代码生成上表现优于或等于现有最佳公开模型，联合训练显著提升竞赛编程性能。

Conclusion: OpenCodeReasoning-II数据集与联合训练策略为代码推理任务提供了有效支持，并扩展了LiveCodeBench基准以支持C++语言。

Abstract: Recent advancements in reasoning-based Large Language Models (LLMs),
particularly their potential through test-time scaling, have created
significant opportunities for distillation in code generation and critique.
However, progress in both areas fundamentally depends on large-scale,
high-quality datasets. In this work, we introduce OpenCodeReasoning-II, a
dataset consists of 2.5M question-solution-critique triples (approx. 35K unique
programming questions), making it nearly twice the size of the previous largest
publicly available code reasoning dataset. In this work, we employ a two-stage
supervised fine-tuning strategy. The first stage focuses on fine-tuning for
code generation, while the second stage involves the joint training of models
for both code generation and critique. Our resulting finetuned Qwen2.5-Instruct
models achieve performance in code generation that either exceeds or equals the
best prior open-weight distilled models. Notably, the integration of our code
generation and critique models leads to significant improvements in competitive
coding performance. Furthermore, we present an extension of the LiveCodeBench
benchmark to specifically support the C++ programming language, thereby
facilitating more comprehensive LLM evaluation using this benchmark.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态参数记忆（DPM）机制，用于解决语音大语言模型（SLLM）在处理长音频序列时的限制，显著提升了情感识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音模态的高帧率限制了SLLM的信号处理和理解能力，现有方法忽视了情感在对话中的连续性和惯性。

Method: 采用动态参数记忆（DPM）机制，结合上下文语义和句子级情感编码，通过临时LoRA模块逐步存储信息。

Result: 在IEMOCAP数据集上，DPM显著提升了SLLM处理长音频序列的情感识别能力，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: DPM机制有效扩展了SLLM的处理能力，为长音频情感识别提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Recent research has focused on applying speech large language model (SLLM) to
improve speech emotion recognition (SER). However, the inherently high frame
rate in speech modality severely limits the signal processing and understanding
capabilities of SLLM. For example, a SLLM with a 4K context window can only
process 80 seconds of audio at 50Hz feature sampling rate before reaching its
capacity limit. Input token compression methods used in SLLM overlook the
continuity and inertia of emotions across multiple conversation turns. This
paper proposes a Dynamic Parameter Memory (DPM) mechanism with contextual
semantics and sentence-level emotion encoding, enabling processing of
unlimited-length audio with limited context windows in SLLM. Specifically, DPM
progressively encodes sentence-level information and emotions into a temporary
LoRA module during inference to effectively "memorize" the contextual
information. We trained an emotion SLLM as a backbone and incorporated our DPM
into inference for emotion recognition in conversation (ERC). Experimental
results on the IEMOCAP dataset show that DPM significantly improves the emotion
recognition capabilities of SLLM when processing long audio sequences,
achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Result: CompassJudger-2在多个评判和奖励基准测试中表现优异，7B模型与更大模型竞争。提出JudgerBenchV2标准化评判模型评估。

Conclusion: CompassJudger-2提升了评判模型的鲁棒性和可扩展性，并确立了新的性能和评估标准。

Abstract: Recently, the role of LLM-as-judge in evaluating large language models has
gained prominence. However, current judge models suffer from narrow
specialization and limited robustness, undermining their capacity for
comprehensive evaluations. In this work, we present CompassJudger-2, a novel
generalist judge model that overcomes these limitations via a task-driven,
multi-domain data curation strategy. Central to our approach is supervising
judgment tasks with verifiable rewards, guiding intrinsic critical reasoning
through rejection sampling to foster robust, generalizable judgment
capabilities. We introduce a refined learning objective with margin policy
gradient loss to enhance performance. Empirically, CompassJudger-2 achieves
superior results across multiple judge and reward benchmarks, and our 7B model
demonstrates competitive judgment accuracy with significantly larger models
like DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3-235B-A22B. Additionally, we propose JudgerBenchV2, a
comprehensive benchmark evaluating cross-domain judgment accuracy and rank
consistency to standardize judge model evaluation. These contributions advance
robust, scalable LLM judgment and establish new performance and evaluation
standards.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统扫描教材可能引发的版权问题，同时填补小模型在晶体学领域的知识空白。

Method: 通过GPT-4.5生成紧凑的领域特定参考内容，并在217个专家级XRD问题上评估不同视觉语言模型的性能。

Result: 使用GPT-4.5生成摘要的模型准确性显著提升，尤其是在晶体学训练有限的情况下。

Conclusion: OPENXRD证明了开卷系统在材料科学中的实用性，并为科学领域的NLP工具提供了基础。

Abstract: This work presents OPENXRD, an open-book pipeline designed for
crystallography question answering, which integrates textual prompts with
concise supporting content generated by GPT-4.5. Instead of using scanned
textbooks, which may lead to copyright issues, OPENXRD generates compact,
domain-specific references that help smaller models understand key concepts in
X-ray diffraction (XRD). We evaluate OPENXRD on a well-defined set of 217
expert-level XRD questions by comparing different vision-language models,
including GPT-4 and LLaVA-based frameworks such as Mistral, LLaMA, and QWEN,
under both closed-book (without supporting material) and open-book (with
supporting material) conditions. Our experimental results show significant
accuracy improvements in models that use the GPT-4.5-generated summaries,
particularly those with limited prior training in crystallography. OPENXRD uses
knowledge from larger models to fill knowledge gaps in crystallography and
shows that AI-generated texts can help smaller models reason more effectively
in scientific tasks. While the current version of OPENXRD focuses on text-based
inputs, we also explore future extensions such as adding real crystal diagrams
or diffraction patterns to improve interpretation in specialized materials
science contexts. Overall, OPENXRD shows that specialized open-book systems can
be useful in materials science and provides a foundation for broader natural
language processing (NLP) tools in critical scientific fields.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 战略对话中欺骗检测的复杂性和类别不平衡问题，尤其是欺骗信息占比极低（<5%）。

Method: 结合冻结BERT嵌入、可解释的语用和游戏特定特征，采用PU学习目标，针对少量标注欺骗信息的情况。

Result: 模型在Diplomacy数据集上达到0.60的宏F1值，同时减少了650倍以上的可训练参数。

Conclusion: PU学习、语用可解释性和说话者感知表示在欺骗检测中具有重要价值，准确检测欺骗信息比识别真实信息更为关键。

Abstract: Detecting deception in strategic dialogues is a complex and high-stakes task
due to the subtlety of language and extreme class imbalance between deceptive
and truthful communications. In this work, we revisit deception detection in
the Diplomacy dataset, where less than 5% of messages are labeled deceptive. We
introduce a lightweight yet effective model combining frozen BERT embeddings,
interpretable linguistic and game-specific features, and a Positive-Unlabeled
(PU) learning objective. Unlike traditional binary classifiers, PU-Lie is
tailored for situations where only a small portion of deceptive messages are
labeled, and the majority are unlabeled. Our model achieves a new best macro F1
of 0.60 while reducing trainable parameters by over 650x. Through comprehensive
evaluations and ablation studies across seven models, we demonstrate the value
of PU learning, linguistic interpretability, and speaker-aware representations.
Notably, we emphasize that in this problem setting, accurately detecting
deception is more critical than identifying truthful messages. This priority
guides our choice of PU learning, which explicitly models the rare but vital
deceptive class.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of multimodal misinformation presents significant
challenges for automated fact-checking systems, especially when claims are
ambiguous or lack sufficient context. We introduce RAMA, a novel
retrieval-augmented multi-agent framework designed for verifying multimedia
misinformation. RAMA incorporates three core innovations: (1) strategic query
formulation that transforms multimodal claims into precise web search queries;
(2) cross-verification evidence aggregation from diverse, authoritative
sources; and (3) a multi-agent ensemble architecture that leverages the
complementary strengths of multiple multimodal large language models and prompt
variants. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAMA achieves superior
performance on benchmark datasets, particularly excelling in resolving
ambiguous or improbable claims by grounding verification in retrieved factual
evidence. Our findings underscore the necessity of integrating web-based
evidence and multi-agent reasoning for trustworthy multimedia verification,
paving the way for more reliable and scalable fact-checking solutions. RAMA
will be publicly available at https://github.com/kalendsyang/RAMA.git.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种基于剪枝的微调方法，通过识别并剪除与数据集特定机制相关的神经元，提升大语言模型的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）常依赖数据集特定的相关性机制，导致在新任务或分布上性能下降。

Method: 使用Integrated Gradients量化神经元对高置信度预测的影响，剪除对数据集特定性能贡献过大的神经元。

Result: 在多项选择题基准测试中，该方法显著提升了性能，优于非剪枝的适应方法。

Conclusion: 剪枝微调方法有效增强了模型的泛化能力，减少了数据集特定机制的依赖。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often develop learned mechanisms specialized to
specific datasets, such as reliance on domain-specific correlations, which
yield high-confidence predictions without generalizable reasoning. While
beneficial in one setting, these dataset-specific mechanisms typically degrade
performance when models encounter novel tasks or distributions. In this work,
we introduce a fine-tuning approach designed to enhance generalization by
identifying and pruning neurons associated with dataset-specific mechanisms in
transformer-based LLMs. Our method employs Integrated Gradients to quantify
each neuron's influence on high-confidence predictions, pinpointing those that
disproportionately contribute to dataset-specific performance without
supporting robust, transferable reasoning. Selectively pruning these neurons
compels the model to depend on generalizable representations. Evaluated across
multiple-choice benchmarks, our pruning-based fine-tuning significantly
enhances performance, surpassing prior (non-pruning) adaptation methods.

Motivation: 藏语作为低资源语言在现有模型中代表性不足，缺乏高质量训练语料。

Method: 聚合多源数据并定制藏语专用数据清洗流程，构建最大藏语预训练语料库，继续预训练/后训练多语言基础模型。

Result: Banzhida在多种任务中显著优于类似规模的开源模型和专为藏语设计的模型。

Conclusion: Banzhida为藏语生成AI提供了显著进步，填补了低资源语言的空白。

Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable progress across many
languages. However, Tibetan, as a representative low-resource language, is
particularly underrepresented in existing models due to the scarcity of
high-quality training corpora. To address this gap, we curate the largest
Tibetan pre-training corpus to date, aggregating data from diverse sources and
applying a dedicated data cleaning and processing pipeline tailored for
Tibetan. With the curated data, we continue pre/post-training a multilingual
base model into Banzhida, a multilingual large language model that advances
generative AI for Tibetan. To evaluate the Tibetan capabilities of the model,
we create new high-quality Tibetan benchmarks, and complement them with
existing public benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that Banzhida
consistently and significantly outperforms both open-source models of similar
scale and Tibetan-tailored models across a wide range of tasks.

Motivation: 探讨视觉隐喻在气候变化传播中的实际效果，填补相关研究的空白。

Method: 创建MetaClimage数据库，包含视觉隐喻和直白图像，并通过人类评分和自然语言处理分析其效果。

Result: 视觉隐喻更难理解但更美观，未在效果和情感唤起上优于直白图像，但能引发更多标签和积极情绪。

Conclusion: 视觉隐喻虽增加认知负担，但能促进更深的认知加工和积极体验，为环境传播提供了权衡考量。

Abstract: Visual metaphors of climate change (e.g., melting glaciers depicted as a
melting ice grenade) are regarded as valuable tools for addressing the
complexity of environmental challenges. However, few studies have examined
their impact on communication, also due to scattered availability of material.
Here, we present a novel database of Metaphors of Climate Change in Images
(MetaClimage) https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15861012, paired with literal
images and enriched with human ratings. For each image, we collected values of
difficulty, efficacy, artistic quality, and emotional arousal from human
rating, as well as number of tags generated by participants to summarize the
message. Semantic and emotion variables were further derived from the tags via
Natural Language Processing. Visual metaphors were rated as more difficult to
understand, yet more aesthetically pleasant than literal images, but did not
differ in efficacy and arousal. The latter for visual metaphors, however, was
higher in participants with higher Need For Cognition. Furthermore, visual
metaphors received more tags, often referring to entities not depicted in the
image, and elicited words with more positive valence and greater dominance than
literal images. These results evidence the greater cognitive load of visual
metaphors, which nevertheless might induce positive effects such as deeper
cognitive elaboration and abstraction compared to literal stimuli. Furthermore,
while they are not deemed as more effective and arousing, visual metaphors seem
to generate superior aesthetic appreciation and a more positively valenced
experience. Overall, this study contributes to understanding the impact of
visual metaphors of climate change both by offering a database for future
research and by elucidating a cost-benefit trade-off to take into account when
shaping environmental communication.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种心理学启发的幽默分解机制（HDM），结合思维链（CoT）和幽默理论，显著提升了大型语言模型（LLMs）在幽默翻译中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 幽默翻译在跨文化交流中至关重要，但现有LLMs在此任务中表现不佳，主要问题包括语言干扰和缺乏幽默感。

Method: 提出HDM机制，利用CoT模仿人类思维过程，并结合幽默理论优化翻译文本的幽默性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在幽默性、流畅性和连贯性上分别提升了7.75%、2.81%和6.13%。

Conclusion: HDM有效提升了LLMs的幽默翻译质量，为跨文化沟通提供了新工具。

Abstract: Humour translation plays a vital role as a bridge between different cultures,
fostering understanding and communication. Although most existing Large
Language Models (LLMs) are capable of general translation tasks, these models
still struggle with humour translation, which is especially reflected through
linguistic interference and lacking humour in translated text. In this paper,
we propose a psychology-inspired Humour Decomposition Mechanism (HDM) that
utilises Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to imitate the ability of the human thought
process, stimulating LLMs to optimise the readability of translated humorous
texts. Moreover, we integrate humour theory in HDM to further enhance the
humorous elements in the translated text. Our automatic evaluation experiments
on open-source humour datasets demonstrate that our method significantly
improves the quality of humour translation, yielding average gains of 7.75\% in
humour, 2.81\% in fluency, and 6.13\% in coherence of the generated text.

Conclusion: ClaritySpeech在提升语音清晰度和隐私保护方面表现优异，适用于低数据环境。

Abstract: Dementia, a neurodegenerative disease, alters speech patterns, creating
communication barriers and raising privacy concerns. Current speech
technologies, such as automatic speech transcription (ASR), struggle with
dementia and atypical speech, further challenging accessibility. This paper
presents a novel dementia obfuscation in speech framework, ClaritySpeech,
integrating ASR, text obfuscation, and zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) to
correct dementia-affected speech while preserving speaker identity in low-data
environments without fine-tuning. Results show a 16% and 10% drop in mean F1
score across various adversarial settings and modalities (audio, text, fusion)
for ADReSS and ADReSSo, respectively, maintaining 50% speaker similarity. We
also find that our system improves WER (from 0.73 to 0.08 for ADReSS and 0.15
for ADReSSo) and speech quality from 1.65 to ~2.15, enhancing privacy and

Result: 现有方法在不同任务中表现不一，无单一方法全面占优，且性能受任务设计影响。

Conclusion: DATE-LM为未来语言模型数据归因研究提供了基础，并发布了公开排行榜以促进社区参与。

Abstract: Data attribution methods quantify the influence of training data on model
outputs and are becoming increasingly relevant for a wide range of LLM research
and applications, including dataset curation, model interpretability, data
valuation. However, there remain critical gaps in systematic LLM-centric
evaluation of data attribution methods. To this end, we introduce DATE-LM (Data
Attribution Evaluation in Language Models), a unified benchmark for evaluating
data attribution methods through real-world LLM applications. DATE-LM measures
attribution quality through three key tasks -- training data selection,
toxicity/bias filtering, and factual attribution. Our benchmark is designed for
ease of use, enabling researchers to configure and run large-scale evaluations
across diverse tasks and LLM architectures. Furthermore, we use DATE-LM to
conduct a large-scale evaluation of existing data attribution methods. Our
findings show that no single method dominates across all tasks, data
attribution methods have trade-offs with simpler baselines, and method
performance is sensitive to task-specific evaluation design. Finally, we
release a public leaderboard for quick comparison of methods and to facilitate
community engagement. We hope DATE-LM serves as a foundation for future data
attribution research in LLMs.

Conclusion: 优化模型在临床NLP中表现优异，具有广泛医疗应用潜力。

Abstract: This study explores the optimization of the DRAGON Longformer base model for
clinical text classification, specifically targeting the binary classification
of medical case descriptions. A dataset of 500 clinical cases containing
structured medical observations was used, with 400 cases for training and 100
for validation. Enhancements to the pre-trained
joeranbosma/dragon-longformer-base-mixed-domain model included hyperparameter

modifications involved increasing sequence length from 512 to 1024 tokens,
adjusting learning rates from 1e-05 to 5e-06, extending training epochs from 5
to 8, and incorporating specialized medical terminology. The optimized model
achieved notable performance gains: accuracy improved from 72.0% to 85.2%,
precision from 68.0% to 84.1%, recall from 75.0% to 86.3%, and F1-score from
71.0% to 85.2%. Statistical analysis confirmed the significance of these
improvements (p < .001). The model demonstrated enhanced capability in
interpreting medical terminology, anatomical measurements, and clinical
observations. These findings contribute to domain-specific language model
research and offer practical implications for clinical natural language
processing applications. The optimized model's strong performance across
diverse medical conditions underscores its potential for broad use in
healthcare settings.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) lifts the factuality of Large Language
Models (LLMs) by injecting external knowledge, yet it falls short on problems
that demand multi-step inference; conversely, purely reasoning-oriented
approaches often hallucinate or mis-ground facts. This survey synthesizes both
strands under a unified reasoning-retrieval perspective. We first map how
advanced reasoning optimizes each stage of RAG (Reasoning-Enhanced RAG). Then,
we show how retrieved knowledge of different type supply missing premises and
expand context for complex inference (RAG-Enhanced Reasoning). Finally, we
spotlight emerging Synergized RAG-Reasoning frameworks, where (agentic) LLMs
iteratively interleave search and reasoning to achieve state-of-the-art
performance across knowledge-intensive benchmarks. We categorize methods,
datasets, and open challenges, and outline research avenues toward deeper
RAG-Reasoning systems that are more effective, multimodally-adaptive,
trustworthy, and human-centric. The collection is available at

Motivation: 现有讽刺生成研究依赖文本模态且忽视视觉线索，数据集存在图像内容与讽刺意图不匹配的问题。

Method: 提出M2SaG数据集（4970个样本）和ViSP框架，结合PPO和对比学习优化生成。

Result: ViSP在五个指标上超越基线模型，生成文本的讽刺分数（0.898 vs. 0.770）和事实不一致性（0.768 vs. 0.739）更高。

Conclusion: ViSP能生成更高质量的讽刺内容，数据集和代码将公开。

Abstract: Human emotions are complex, with sarcasm being a subtle and distinctive form.
Despite progress in sarcasm research, sarcasm generation remains underexplored,
primarily due to the overreliance on textual modalities and the neglect of
visual cues, as well as the mismatch between image content and sarcastic intent
in existing datasets. In this paper, we introduce M2SaG, a multimodal sarcasm
generation dataset with 4,970 samples, each containing an image, a sarcastic
text, and a sarcasm target. To benchmark M2SaG, we propose ViSP, a generation
framework that integrates Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and contrastive
learning. PPO utilizes reward scores from DIP to steer the generation of
sarcastic texts, while contrastive learning encourages the model to favor
outputs with higher reward scores. These strategies improve overall generation
quality and produce texts with more pronounced sarcastic intent. We evaluate
ViSP across five metric sets and find it surpasses all baselines, including
large language models, underscoring their limitations in sarcasm generation.
Furthermore, we analyze the distributions of Sarcasm Scores and Factual
Incongruity for both M2SaG and the texts generated by ViSP. The generated texts
exhibit higher mean Sarcasm Scores (0.898 vs. 0.770) and Factual Incongruity
(0.768 vs. 0.739), demonstrating that ViSP produces higher-quality sarcastic
content than the original dataset. % The dataset and code will be publicly

Result: 在英文ABSA基准数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过数据增强和强化学习有效提升了ABSA任务的性能。

Abstract: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a crucial fine-grained task in
social media scenarios to identify the sentiment polarity of specific aspect
terms in a sentence. Although many existing studies leverage large language
models (LLMs) to perform ABSA due to their strong context understanding
capabilities, they still face challenges to learn the context information in
the running text because of the short text, as well as the small and unbalanced
labeled training data, where most data are labeled with positive sentiment.
Data augmentation (DA) is a feasible strategy for providing richer contextual
information, especially when using LLMs to create synthetic training data, but
faces challenges in ensuring a high quality of the augmented data.In this
paper, we propose an LLM-based ABSA approach with training data
augmentation.Specifically, an LLM is prompted to generate augmented training
data based on the original training data, so as to construct a new training
data with larger size and balanced label distributions to better train an ABSA
model. Meanwhile, in order to improve the quality of the augmented data, we
propose a reinforcement learning approach to optimize the data augmentation.
LLM.Experiment results and further analyses on English benchmark datasets for
ABSA demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, where superior performance
is observed over strong baselines and most existing studies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统单用途AI系统在协调性、记忆复用和任务分解能力上的不足，以应对复杂动态的企业环境需求。

Method: 基于Model Context Protocol（MCP）构建A2A通信层，结合Experience Pack（XP）架构实现知识保留和持续学习。

Result: 在复杂任务编排基准测试中，GoalfyMax表现出优于基线框架的适应性、协调性和经验复用能力。

Conclusion: GoalfyMax为多智能体系统提供了可扩展的未来基础。

Abstract: Modern enterprise environments demand intelligent systems capable of handling
complex, dynamic, and multi-faceted tasks with high levels of autonomy and
adaptability. However, traditional single-purpose AI systems often lack
sufficient coordination, memory reuse, and task decomposition capabilities,
limiting their scalability in realistic settings. To address these challenges,
we present \textbf{GoalfyMax}, a protocol-driven framework for end-to-end
multi-agent collaboration. GoalfyMax introduces a standardized Agent-to-Agent
(A2A) communication layer built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing
independent agents to coordinate through asynchronous, protocol-compliant
interactions. It incorporates the Experience Pack (XP) architecture, a layered
memory system that preserves both task rationales and execution traces,
enabling structured knowledge retention and continual learning. Moreover, our
system integrates advanced features including multi-turn contextual dialogue,
long-short term memory modules, and dynamic safety validation, supporting
robust, real-time strategy adaptation. Empirical results on complex task
orchestration benchmarks and case study demonstrate that GoalfyMax achieves
superior adaptability, coordination, and experience reuse compared to baseline
frameworks. These findings highlight its potential as a scalable, future-ready
foundation for multi-agent intelligent systems.

Motivation: 长上下文引用是LCLMs的关键任务，但尚未充分研究，因此需要新的评估基准。

Method: 设计了Ref-Long基准，包含三个子集（合成到真实场景），要求模型识别引用特定键的文档索引。

Result: 实验显示13种LCLMs在长上下文引用任务上表现不佳，包括GPT-4o。

Conclusion: Ref-Long揭示了LCLMs在长上下文引用上的不足，并提供了关键分析见解。

Abstract: Long-context language models (LCLMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities
in long-context understanding tasks. Among these, long-context referencing -- a
crucial task that requires LCLMs to attribute items of interest to specific
parts of long-context data -- remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, this
paper proposes Referencing Evaluation for Long-context Language Models
(Ref-Long), a novel benchmark designed to assess the long-context referencing
capability of LCLMs. Specifically, Ref-Long requires LCLMs to identify the
indexes of documents that reference a specific key, emphasizing contextual
relationships between the key and the documents over simple retrieval. Based on
the task design, we construct three subsets ranging from synthetic to realistic
scenarios to form the Ref-Long benchmark. Experimental results of 13 LCLMs
reveal significant shortcomings in long-context referencing, even among
advanced models like GPT-4o. To further investigate these challenges, we
conduct comprehensive analyses, including human evaluations, task format
adjustments, fine-tuning experiments, and error analyses, leading to several
key insights. Our data and code can be found in https://github.

translation evaluations, but they are also known to be sensitive to errors and
perturbations in their prompts. We systematically evaluate how both humanly
plausible and synthetic errors in user prompts affect LLMs' performance on two
related tasks: Machine translation and machine translation evaluation. We
provide both a quantitative analysis and qualitative insights into how the
models respond to increasing noise in the user prompt.
  The prompt quality strongly affects the translation performance: With many
errors, even a good prompt can underperform a minimal or poor prompt without
errors. However, different noise types impact translation quality differently,
with character-level and combined noisers degrading performance more than
phrasal perturbations. Qualitative analysis reveals that lower prompt quality
largely leads to poorer instruction following, rather than directly affecting
translation quality itself. Further, LLMs can still translate in scenarios with
overwhelming random noise that would make the prompt illegible to humans.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了如何将现有定义建模模型适配到白俄罗斯语，并提出一个包含43,150条定义的新数据集。实验表明，适配过程需要的数据量较少，但自动评估指标存在不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 定义建模任务有助于辅助词典编纂工作，但目前对未支持语言的模型适配研究不足。本文旨在填补这一空白，特别是针对白俄罗斯语。

Method: 提出一个包含43,150条定义的新数据集，并实验评估现有模型在白俄罗斯语上的适配效果。

Result: 实验表明，适配定义建模系统所需数据量较少，但自动评估指标未能全面反映模型性能。

Conclusion: 定义建模模型可以高效适配到新语言，但需改进评估方法以更准确衡量性能。

Abstract: Definition modeling, the task of generating new definitions for words in
context, holds great prospect as a means to assist the work of lexicographers
in documenting a broader variety of lects and languages, yet much remains to be
done in order to assess how we can leverage pre-existing models for as-of-yet
unsupported languages. In this work, we focus on adapting existing models to
Belarusian, for which we propose a novel dataset of 43,150 definitions. Our
experiments demonstrate that adapting a definition modeling systems requires
minimal amounts of data, but that there currently are gaps in what automatic
metrics do capture.

*Hanwool Lee,Sara Yu,Yewon Hwang,Jonghyun Choi,Heejae Ahn,Sungbum Jung,Youngjae Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NMIXX是一种针对金融领域的跨语言嵌入模型，通过微调18.8K高质量三元组数据，显著提升了金融语义的捕捉能力，尤其是在低资源语言如韩语中。同时发布的KorFinSTS基准测试进一步验证了其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用句子嵌入模型在金融领域（尤其是低资源语言如韩语）中表现不佳，主要由于领域术语、时间语义变化和双语词汇不对齐等问题。

Method: 提出NMIXX模型，通过微调包含领域内同义句、硬负例和精确韩英翻译的三元组数据，优化跨语言金融语义表示。

Result: NMIXX在英语FinSTS和韩语KorFinSTS基准测试中分别提升0.10和0.22的Spearman's rho分数，显著优于其他模型。

Conclusion: NMIXX和KorFinSTS的发布为金融领域的跨语言表示学习提供了有效工具，同时强调了分词设计在低资源语言中的重要性。

Abstract: General-purpose sentence embedding models often struggle to capture
specialized financial semantics, especially in low-resource languages like
Korean, due to domain-specific jargon, temporal meaning shifts, and misaligned
bilingual vocabularies. To address these gaps, we introduce NMIXX (Neural
eMbeddings for Cross-lingual eXploration of Finance), a suite of cross-lingual
embedding models fine-tuned with 18.8K high-confidence triplets that pair
in-domain paraphrases, hard negatives derived from a semantic-shift typology,
and exact Korean-English translations. Concurrently, we release KorFinSTS, a
1,921-pair Korean financial STS benchmark spanning news, disclosures, research
reports, and regulations, designed to expose nuances that general benchmarks
miss.
  When evaluated against seven open-license baselines, NMIXX's multilingual
bge-m3 variant achieves Spearman's rho gains of +0.10 on English FinSTS and
+0.22 on KorFinSTS, outperforming its pre-adaptation checkpoint and surpassing
other models by the largest margin, while revealing a modest trade-off in
general STS performance. Our analysis further shows that models with richer
Korean token coverage adapt more effectively, underscoring the importance of
tokenizer design in low-resource, cross-lingual settings. By making both models
and the benchmark publicly available, we provide the community with robust
tools for domain-adapted, multilingual representation learning in finance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究认知、心理和临床现象中的激活动态如何反映知识建模中的理论基础，提供系统化的研究工具。

Method: 开发SpreadPy库，支持基于经验或理论网络的模拟，通过三个案例研究验证其效用。

Result: 案例研究显示SpreadPy能区分数学焦虑学生的知识结构差异、揭示认知负荷对词汇访问的影响，以及将网络结构与临床失语症错误类型关联。

Conclusion: SpreadPy为心理学、神经科学和教育研究提供了可重复的研究工具，支持对个体差异和认知障碍的机制研究。

Abstract: We introduce SpreadPy as a Python library for simulating spreading activation
in cognitive single-layer and multiplex networks. Our tool is designed to
perform numerical simulations testing structure-function relationships in
cognitive processes. By comparing simulation results with grounded theories in
knowledge modelling, SpreadPy enables systematic investigations of how
activation dynamics reflect cognitive, psychological and clinical phenomena. We
demonstrate the library's utility through three case studies: (1) Spreading
activation on associative knowledge networks distinguishes students with high
versus low math anxiety, revealing anxiety-related structural differences in
conceptual organization; (2) Simulations of a creativity task show that
activation trajectories vary with task difficulty, exposing how cognitive load
modulates lexical access; (3) In individuals with aphasia, simulated activation
patterns on lexical networks correlate with empirical error types (semantic vs.
phonological) during picture-naming tasks, linking network structure to
clinical impairments. SpreadPy's flexible framework allows researchers to model
these processes using empirically derived or theoretical networks, providing
mechanistic insights into individual differences and cognitive impairments. The
library is openly available, supporting reproducible research in psychology,
neuroscience, and education research.

Result: 参数化方法在跨语言泛化上表现不佳，指令调优方法更稳健；联合阿拉伯语-英语训练提高了编辑性和迁移性。

Conclusion: 阿拉伯语KE基准和多语言LTE训练数据的发布将支持未来研究。

Abstract: While Knowledge Editing (KE) has been widely explored in English, its
behavior in morphologically rich languages like Arabic remains underexamined.
In this work, we present the first study of Arabic KE. We evaluate four methods
(ROME, MEMIT, ICE, and LTE) on Arabic translations of the ZsRE and Counterfact
benchmarks, analyzing both multilingual and cross-lingual settings. Our
experiments on Llama-2-7B-chat show show that parameter-based methods struggle
with cross-lingual generalization, while instruction-tuned methods perform more
robustly. We extend Learning-To-Edit (LTE) to a multilingual setting and show
that joint Arabic-English training improves both editability and transfer. We
release Arabic KE benchmarks and multilingual training for LTE data to support
future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 泰国法律问答系统中RAG的性能有限，特别是在需要复杂法律推理的问题上，因此需要一种更高效的方法来提升性能。

Method: 采用Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)方法，结合BGE-M3嵌入作为语义相似性奖励，显著降低计算成本。

Result: 在NitiBench基准测试中，GRPO实现了90%的引用F1提升和31%的联合质量指标提升，同时在复杂法律推理任务中表现更稳健。

Conclusion: GRPO为提升泰国法律LLM提供了一种高效且资源节约的解决方案。

Abstract: The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems' performance on Thai legal
question answering is still limited, especially for questions requiring
extensive, complex legal reasoning. To address these limitations, we introduce
an approach aligning LLMs toward improved law citation accuracy and better
response quality using Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our approach
leverages BGE-M3 embeddings as a cost-efficient semantic-similarity reward,
significantly reducing computational expenses up to 2.5x compared to large
language model judges. Experiments on the NitiBench benchmark demonstrate
substantial improvements: GRPO achieves up to 90% citation-F1 gains from the
base model and a 31% increase in joint quality metrics over instruction tuning.
Crucially, our method shows enhanced robustness on complex legal reasoning
tasks compared to instruction tuning, providing an effective and
resource-efficient solution for enhancing Thai legal LLMs.

TL;DR: MCEval是一个多语言文化评估框架，用于评估大型语言模型的文化意识和偏见，覆盖13种文化和语言，揭示性能差异和公平性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型存在文化偏见和跨文化理解能力不足的问题，尤其是在服务全球多样化用户时。

Method: 提出MCEval框架，采用动态文化问题构建和因果分析（反事实重述和混杂重述），评估13种文化和语言。

Result: 实验结果显示性能差异，文化表现与训练数据分布和语言-文化对齐相关，并暴露公平性问题。

Conclusion: MCEval是首个全面的多语言文化评估框架，为LLMs的文化理解提供深入见解。

Abstract: Large language models exhibit cultural biases and limited cross-cultural
understanding capabilities, particularly when serving diverse global user
populations. We propose MCEval, a novel multilingual evaluation framework that
employs dynamic cultural question construction and enables causal analysis
through Counterfactual Rephrasing and Confounder Rephrasing. Our comprehensive
evaluation spans 13 cultures and 13 languages, systematically assessing both
cultural awareness and cultural bias across different linguistic scenarios. The
framework provides 39,897 cultural awareness instances and 17,940 cultural bias
instances. Experimental results reveal performance disparities across different
linguistic scenarios, demonstrating that optimal cultural performance is not
only linked to training data distribution, but also is related to
language-culture alignment. The evaluation results also expose the fairness
issue, where approaches appearing successful in the English scenario create
substantial disadvantages. MCEval represents the first comprehensive
multilingual cultural evaluation framework that provides deeper insights into
LLMs' cultural understanding.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型（LLMs）的潜在空间几何结构中，高层次语义信息集中在低维子空间中，且在不同领域间线性可分。这种可分性在深层和结构化推理提示下更明显，支持通过几何感知工具检测和防御有害内容。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs内部如何组织与语义理解相关的表征，以改进模型对齐和解释其行为。

Method: 对11个基于Transformer的解码器模型进行大规模实证研究，分析6个科学主题和12层的隐藏状态。

Result: 高层次语义信息集中在低维子空间，线性可分性在深层和结构化推理提示下更明显。通过简单向量方向可捕捉推理模式（如链式思考）。

Conclusion: 潜在空间几何结构支持开发几何感知工具，直接操作表征以检测和防御有害内容，如通过轻量级MLP分类器实现高精度检测。

Abstract: Understanding the latent space geometry of large language models (LLMs) is
key to interpreting their behavior and improving alignment. \baturay{However,
it remains unclear to what extent LLMs internally organize representations
related to semantic understanding. To investigate this, we conduct a
large-scale empirical study of hidden states in transformer-based LLMs,
analyzing 11 decoder-only models across 6 scientific topics and 12 layers each.
We find that high-level semantic information consistently lies in
low-dimensional subspaces that form linearly separable representations across
distinct domains. This separability becomes more pronounced in deeper layers
and under prompts that trigger structured reasoning or alignment
behaviors$\unicode{x2013}$even when surface content is unchanged. This geometry
enables simple yet effective causal interventions in hidden space; for example,
reasoning patterns like chain-of-thought can be captured by a single vector
direction. Together, these findings support the development of geometry-aware
tools that operate directly on latent representations to detect and mitigate
harmful or adversarial content, using methods such as transport-based defenses
that leverage this separability. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate this
potential by training a simple MLP classifier as a lightweight latent-space
guardrail, which detects adversarial and malicious prompts with high precision.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自适应的课程学习范式，利用预训练语言模型预测难度分数，优化微调顺序，提升自然语言理解任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有课程学习方法依赖人工定义的难度指标（如文本长度），可能无法准确反映模型视角。

Method: 通过预训练语言模型预测难度分数，探索不同微调顺序策略（从易到难、从难到易、混合采样）。

Result: 在四个自然语言理解数据集上验证，方法比随机采样收敛更快且性能更优。

Conclusion: 自适应课程学习能有效提升模型训练效率和性能。

Abstract: Curriculum learning is a widely adopted training strategy in natural language
processing (NLP), where models are exposed to examples organized by increasing
difficulty to enhance learning efficiency and performance. However, most
existing approaches rely on manually defined difficulty metrics -- such as text
length -- which may not accurately reflect the model's own perspective. To
overcome this limitation, we present a self-adaptive curriculum learning
paradigm that prioritizes fine-tuning examples based on difficulty scores
predicted by pre-trained language models (PLMs) themselves. Building on these
scores, we explore various training strategies that differ in the ordering of
examples for the fine-tuning: from easy-to-hard, hard-to-easy, to mixed
sampling. We evaluate our method on four natural language understanding (NLU)
datasets covering both binary and multi-class classification tasks.
Experimental results show that our approach leads to faster convergence and
improved performance compared to standard random sampling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对点击诱饵的定义缺乏共识，作者旨在明确其与类似现象的区别，并提出更客观的检测方法。

Method: 通过细化概念界限和标注标准，减少主观性，创建并标注了包含3,500条推文的TA1C数据集，并实现了高标注一致性。

Result: 发布的TA1C数据集标注一致性为0.825（Fleiss' K），基线模型F1分数达到0.84。

Conclusion: 论文提出了点击诱饵的新定义，并展示了高质量数据集和有效基线模型，为未来研究提供了基础。

Abstract: We revise the definition of clickbait, which lacks current consensus, and
argue that the creation of a curiosity gap is the key concept that
distinguishes clickbait from other related phenomena such as sensationalism and
headlines that do not deliver what they promise or diverge from the article.
Therefore, we propose a new definition: clickbait is a technique for generating
headlines and teasers that deliberately omit part of the information with the
goal of raising the readers' curiosity, capturing their attention and enticing
them to click. We introduce a new approach to clickbait detection datasets
creation, by refining the concept limits and annotations criteria, minimizing
the subjectivity in the decision as much as possible. Following it, we created
and release TA1C (for Te Ahorr\'e Un Click, Spanish for Saved You A Click), the
first open source dataset for clickbait detection in Spanish. It consists of
3,500 tweets coming from 18 well known media sources, manually annotated and
reaching a 0.825 Fleiss' K inter annotator agreement. We implement strong
baselines that achieve 0.84 in F1-score.

Motivation: 探究大语言模型如何通过上下文学习完成未见任务，尤其是其内部机制如何驱动任务级泛化。

Method: 使用路径修补等电路式可解释性技术，分析模型在“加一”加法任务中的内部计算。

Result: 发现了一种函数归纳机制，该机制由多个注意力头并行控制，并可复用于其他任务。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了语言模型中可重用和可组合的结构如何支持任务级泛化。

Abstract: Large language models demonstrate the intriguing ability to perform unseen
tasks via in-context learning. However, it remains unclear what mechanisms
inside the model drive such task-level generalization. In this work, we
approach this question through the lens of off-by-one addition (i.e., 1+1=3,
2+2=5, 3+3=?), a two-step, counterfactual task with an unexpected +1 function
as a second step. Leveraging circuit-style interpretability techniques such as
path patching, we analyze the models' internal computations behind their
notable performance and present three key findings. First, we uncover a
function induction mechanism that explains the model's generalization from
standard addition to off-by-one addition. This mechanism resembles the
structure of the induction head mechanism found in prior work and elevates it
to a higher level of abstraction. Second, we show that the induction of the +1
function is governed by multiple attention heads in parallel, each of which
emits a distinct piece of the +1 function. Finally, we find that this function
induction mechanism is reused in a broader range of tasks, including synthetic
tasks such as shifted multiple-choice QA and algorithmic tasks such as base-8
addition. Overall, our findings offer deeper insights into how reusable and
composable structures within language models enable task-level generalization.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的RAG框架，通过层次化文本分割和聚类生成更具语义意义的块，提升了检索的精确性和上下文相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分块方法未能充分捕捉语义信息，且未考虑文本结构，限制了RAG系统的性能。

Method: 结合层次化文本分割和聚类，生成语义连贯的块，并利用段级和簇级向量表示进行检索。

Result: 在NarrativeQA、QuALITY和QASPER数据集上，该方法优于传统分块技术。

Conclusion: 提出的框架显著提升了RAG系统的检索效果，为外部知识整合提供了更优方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems commonly use chunking strategies
for retrieval, which enhance large language models (LLMs) by enabling them to
access external knowledge, ensuring that the retrieved information is
up-to-date and domain-specific. However, traditional methods often fail to
create chunks that capture sufficient semantic meaning, as they do not account
for the underlying textual structure. This paper proposes a novel framework
that enhances RAG by integrating hierarchical text segmentation and clustering
to generate more meaningful and semantically coherent chunks. During inference,
the framework retrieves information by leveraging both segment-level and
cluster-level vector representations, thereby increasing the likelihood of
retrieving more precise and contextually relevant information. Evaluations on
the NarrativeQA, QuALITY, and QASPER datasets indicate that the proposed method
achieved improved results compared to traditional chunking techniques.

Motivation: 随着奖励模型在测试时策略中的部署增加，其推理成本成为关注焦点，需要更高效的替代方案。

Method: 结合FLAN风格提示、定向低秩适应（DoRA）和层冻结技术，TinyRM在RewardBench上表现优异。

Result: TinyRM在推理任务中表现突出，轻量级微调方法尤其有效。

Conclusion: 轻量级双向架构有望成为高效、可扩展的偏好建模替代方案，尽管在通用模型和对话偏好建模方面仍有挑战。

Abstract: Large decoder-based language models have become the dominant architecture for
reward modeling in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However,
as reward models are increasingly deployed in test-time strategies, their
inference costs become a growing concern. We present TinyRM, a family of small,
bidirectional masked language models (MLMs) with as few as 400 million
parameters, that rival the capabilities of models over 175 times larger on
reasoning and safety preference modeling tasks. TinyRM combines FLAN-style
prompting, Directional Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA), and layer freezing to
achieve strong performance on RewardBench, despite using significantly fewer
resources. Our experiments suggest that small models benefit from
domain-specific tuning strategies, particularly in reasoning, where lightweight
finetuning methods are especially effective. While challenges remain in
building generalist models and conversational preference modeling, our
preliminary results highlight the promise of lightweight bidirectional
architectures as efficient, scalable alternatives for preference modeling.

Result: 实验证明TextOmics有效，ToDi优于现有方法，并在零样本治疗分子生成中表现出潜力。

Conclusion: TextOmics和ToDi为靶向药物发现提供了重要工具，展示了异构数据整合和可控生成的潜力。

Abstract: Hit-like molecular generation with therapeutic potential is essential for
target-specific drug discovery. However, the field lacks heterogeneous data and
unified frameworks for integrating diverse molecular representations. To bridge
this gap, we introduce TextOmics, a pioneering benchmark that establishes
one-to-one correspondences between omics expressions and molecular textual
descriptions. TextOmics provides a heterogeneous dataset that facilitates
molecular generation through representations alignment. Built upon this
foundation, we propose ToDi, a generative framework that jointly conditions on
omics expressions and molecular textual descriptions to produce biologically
relevant, chemically valid, hit-like molecules. ToDi leverages two encoders
(OmicsEn and TextEn) to capture multi-level biological and semantic
associations, and develops conditional diffusion (DiffGen) for controllable
generation. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of TextOmics and
demonstrate ToDi outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, while also
showcasing remarkable potential in zero-shot therapeutic molecular generation.

Result: 模型在三个数据集上显著优于现有方法，并提供可解释的权重。

Conclusion: 该框架为临床医生提供了更深入的自杀模式理解，有助于制定更有针对性的干预策略。

Abstract: Suicide is a critical global health issue that requires urgent attention.
Even though prior work has revealed valuable insights into detecting current
suicide risk on social media, little attention has been paid to developing
models that can predict subsequent suicide risk over time, limiting their
ability to capture rapid fluctuations in individuals' mental state transitions.
In addition, existing work ignores protective factors that play a crucial role
in suicide risk prediction, focusing predominantly on risk factors alone.
Protective factors such as social support and coping strategies can mitigate
suicide risk by moderating the impact of risk factors. Therefore, this study
proposes a novel framework for predicting subsequent suicide risk by jointly
learning the dynamic influence of both risk factors and protective factors on
users' suicide risk transitions. We propose a novel Protective Factor-Aware
Dataset, which is built from 12 years of Reddit posts along with comprehensive
annotations of suicide risk and both risk and protective factors. We also
introduce a Dynamic Factors Influence Learning approach that captures the
varying impact of risk and protective factors on suicide risk transitions,
recognizing that suicide risk fluctuates over time according to established
psychological theories. Our thorough experiments demonstrate that the proposed
model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models and large language
models across three datasets. In addition, the proposed Dynamic Factors
Influence Learning provides interpretable weights, helping clinicians better
understand suicidal patterns and enabling more targeted intervention
strategies.

TL;DR: GeLaCo是一种基于进化的LLM压缩方法，通过层折叠高效探索压缩解空间，支持单目标和多目标优化，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）因计算需求高面临部署和使用障碍，模型压缩是解决此问题的重要手段，但现有方法成本高且可能忽略更优解。

Method: GeLaCo采用进化方法，通过层折叠和基于种群的搜索，结合模块相似性适应度函数（注意力、前馈和隐藏状态表示），支持单目标和多目标优化。

Result: GeLaCo在困惑度和生成评估中优于现有方法，首次建立了压缩与质量之间的帕累托前沿。

Conclusion: GeLaCo为LLM压缩提供了高效且性能优越的解决方案，推动了模型压缩领域的发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) have achieved remarkable performance across a
large number of tasks, but face critical deployment and usage barriers due to
substantial computational requirements. Model compression methods, which aim to
reduce model size while preserving its capacity, are an important means to
mitigate these issues. Promising approaches along these lines, such as
structured pruning, typically require costly empirical search for optimal
variants and may run the risk of ignoring better solutions. In this work we
introduce GeLaCo, an evolutionary approach to LLM compression via layer
collapse. Our approach supports an efficient exploration of the compression
solution space via population-based search and a module-wise similarity fitness
function capturing attention, feed-forward, and hidden state representations.
GeLaCo also supports both single and multi-objective evolutionary compression
search, establishing the first Pareto frontier along compression and quality
axes. We evaluate GeLaCo solutions via both perplexity-based and generative
evaluations over foundational and instruction-tuned models, outperforming
state-of-the-art alternatives.

Result: LLMs在道德多样性上存在系统性同质化问题，模型规模增加并未显著提升文化代表性。

Conclusion: 当前AI对齐方法存在根本性局限，需开发更接地气的对齐目标和评估指标，以确保AI系统能代表多样化的道德价值观。

Abstract: Are AI systems truly representing human values, or merely averaging across
them? Our study suggests a concerning reality: Large Language Models (LLMs)
fail to represent diverse cultural moral frameworks despite their linguistic
capabilities. We expose significant gaps between AI-generated and human moral
intuitions by applying the Moral Foundations Questionnaire across 19 cultural
contexts. Comparing multiple state-of-the-art LLMs' origins against human
baseline data, we find these models systematically homogenize moral diversity.
Surprisingly, increased model size doesn't consistently improve cultural
representation fidelity. Our findings challenge the growing use of LLMs as
synthetic populations in social science research and highlight a fundamental
limitation in current AI alignment approaches. Without data-driven alignment
beyond prompting, these systems cannot capture the nuanced, culturally-specific
moral intuitions. Our results call for more grounded alignment objectives and
evaluation metrics to ensure AI systems represent diverse human values rather
than flattening the moral landscape.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究ReFT在复杂推理任务中的应用，发现固定位置表示优化效果有限，需关注关键表示。

Method: 提出CRFT方法，通过信息流分析识别关键表示，并在低秩线性子空间中动态优化。

Result: 在八个算术和常识推理基准测试中验证了CRFT的有效性和高效性，少样本设置下准确率提升16.4%。

Conclusion: CRFT展示了表示级优化在推理任务中的潜力，为传统PEFT方法提供了轻量高效的替代方案。

Abstract: Representation Fine-tuning (ReFT), a recently proposed Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method, has attracted widespread attention for significantly
improving parameter efficiency by editing representation space alone. In this
work, we investigate applying ReFT to complex reasoning tasks. However,
directly using the native ReFT method, which modifies fixed representations at
the beginning and end of each layer, yields suboptimal performance, as these
fixed-position representations have uncertain impact on the outputs. We observe
that, in complex reasoning tasks, there often exist certain critical
representations. These representations either integrate significant information
from preceding layers or regulate subsequent layer representations. Through
layer-by-layer propagation, they exert a substantial influence on the final
output. Naturally, fine-tuning these critical representations has the potential
to greatly enhance reasoning performance. Building upon these insights, we
propose Critical Representation Fine-Tuning (CRFT), a novel method that
identifies and optimizes these critical representations through information
flow analysis. CRFT operates within a supervised learning framework,
dynamically optimizing critical representations in a low-rank linear subspace
while freezing the base model. The effectiveness and efficiency of our method
are validated across eight benchmarks for arithmetic and commonsense reasoning,
using LLaMA and Mistral model families. Furthermore, our method also adapts
effectively to few-shot settings, boosting one-shot accuracy by 16.4%. Our work
highlights the untapped potential of representation-level optimization for CoT
reasoning, offering a lightweight yet powerful alternative to traditional PEFT
methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合LLM和Transformer的新架构，用于时间序列预测，融合了语义和时间动态信息，提升了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的方法在时间序列预测中表现不佳，因为LLM擅长离散标记和语义模式，而时间序列是连续数值数据。同时，传统Transformer难以学习高级语义模式。

Method: 设计了一种新型Transformer架构，融合LLM和传统Transformer的表示，结合语义和时间动态信息。

Result: 实验证明，该方法在基准数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 融合LLM和Transformer的架构能有效提升时间序列预测的准确性。

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful
capabilities in performing various tasks and thus are applied by recent studies
to time series forecasting (TSF) tasks, which predict future values with the
given historical time series. Existing LLM-based approaches transfer knowledge
learned from text data to time series prediction using prompting or fine-tuning
strategies. However, LLMs are proficient at reasoning over discrete tokens and
semantic patterns but are not initially designed to model continuous numerical
time series data. The gaps between text and time series data lead LLMs to
achieve inferior performance to a vanilla Transformer model that is directly
trained on TSF data. However, the vanilla Transformers often struggle to learn
high-level semantic patterns. In this paper, we design a novel
Transformer-based architecture that complementarily leverages LLMs and vanilla
Transformers, so as to integrate the high-level semantic representations
learned by LLMs into the temporal information encoded by time series
Transformers, where a hybrid representation is obtained by fusing the
representations from the LLM and the Transformer. The resulting fused
representation contains both historical temporal dynamics and semantic
variation patterns, allowing our model to predict more accurate future values.
Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
approach.

*Khouloud Saadi,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需额外参数的任务特征蒸馏方法，解决了传统特征蒸馏中师生模型隐藏层尺寸不一致的问题，性能提升3%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统特征蒸馏方法要求师生模型隐藏层尺寸相同，限制了学生模型的灵活性，且线性投影方法会引入额外参数并降低性能。

Method: 通过识别教师模型中与任务最相关的隐藏单元，直接将其激活蒸馏到学生模型，无需引入新参数。

Result: 在分类、指令跟随和摘要等任务中，性能比线性投影基线提升3%。

Conclusion: 该方法灵活且高效，适用于不同任务和模型架构。

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) in general and feature distillation in particular
are promising techniques for reducing the high computational demand of large
language models (LLMs). However, traditional feature KD methods typically
assume that the teacher and the student share the same hidden size, limiting
the flexibility of the student's architecture. A common solution to this
problem involves training a linear projector to align their feature spaces, but
this introduces additional parameters that must be learned from scratch and
often degrades performance on downstream tasks, especially in generative
settings. To address this issue, in this work, we propose a novel task-based
feature distillation method that enables knowledge transfer between teacher and
student models with different hidden layer dimensions, without introducing any
new parameters. Leveraging the insight that only a subset of LLM components
contribute significantly to a specific downstream task, our approach identifies
the most task-relevant hidden units in the teacher and directly distills their
activations to the student. Our method is flexible and easily integrates with
other distillation frameworks. Empirical results show consistent improvements
over prior approaches across diverse tasks, including classification,
instruction-following, and summarization, achieving up to a 3\% performance
gain over the linear projection baseline.

TL;DR: 研究探索了大型语言模型（LLMs）在将辱骂性文本转换为非辱骂性文本时的表现，评估了Gemini、GPT-4o、DeepSeek和Groq等模型的效果，发现Groq与其他模型差异显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在自然语言处理任务中表现优异，但其在识别和转换辱骂性文本方面的能力仍需探索。

Method: 使用LLMs将包含仇恨言论和脏话的辱骂性文本转换为非辱骂性文本，同时保留文本意图，并通过情感和语义分析评估原始与转换后的数据集。

Result: Groq的表现与其他模型（如GPT-4o和DeepSeek-V3）差异显著，后两者表现相似。

Conclusion: LLMs在辱骂性文本转换中表现不一，Groq与其他模型差异明显，GPT-4o和DeepSeek-V3效果相近。

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant
advancements in natural language processing tasks, their effectiveness in the
classification and transformation of abusive text into non-abusive versions
remains an area for exploration. In this study, we aim to use LLMs to transform
abusive text (tweets and reviews) featuring hate speech and swear words into
non-abusive text, while retaining the intent of the text. We evaluate the
performance of two state-of-the-art LLMs, such as Gemini, GPT-4o, DeekSeek and
Groq, on their ability to identify abusive text. We them to transform and
obtain a text that is clean from abusive and inappropriate content but
maintains a similar level of sentiment and semantics, i.e. the transformed text
needs to maintain its message. Afterwards, we evaluate the raw and transformed
datasets with sentiment analysis and semantic analysis. Our results show Groq
provides vastly different results when compared with other LLMs. We have
identified similarities between GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3.

Result: 模型在文化和上下文理解任务中表现不佳，揭示了性能差距。

Conclusion: 需要方言感知训练和文化对齐的评估方法，以改进大语言模型在阿拉伯语应用中的表现。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly central to Arabic NLP
applications, evaluating their understanding of regional dialects and cultural
nuances is essential, particularly in linguistically diverse settings like
Saudi Arabia. This paper introduces \texttt{Absher}, a comprehensive benchmark
specifically designed to assess LLMs performance across major Saudi dialects.
\texttt{Absher} comprises over 18,000 multiple-choice questions spanning six
distinct categories: Meaning, True/False, Fill-in-the-Blank, Contextual Usage,
Cultural Interpretation, and Location Recognition. These questions are derived
from a curated dataset of dialectal words, phrases, and proverbs sourced from
various regions of Saudi Arabia. We evaluate several state-of-the-art LLMs,
including multilingual and Arabic-specific models. We also provide detailed
insights into their capabilities and limitations. Our results reveal notable
performance gaps, particularly in tasks requiring cultural inference or
contextual understanding. Our findings highlight the urgent need for
dialect-aware training and culturally aligned evaluation methodologies to
improve LLMs performance in real-world Arabic applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示工程方法多针对简单任务和大型LLMs，而复杂任务和小型模型对提示设计更敏感，需更高效的优化方法。

Method: 采用两阶段进化搜索：第一阶段通过语法引导的遗传编程合成提示创建程序；第二阶段通过局部搜索进一步优化性能。

Result: 在四个领域特定任务中，优于PromptWizard、OPRO和RL-Prompt三种方法，且性能退化极少。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了复杂任务和小型LLMs的提示优化问题，性能稳定且优于现有技术。

Abstract: Prompt engineering has proven to be a crucial step in leveraging pretrained
large language models (LLMs) in solving various real-world tasks. Numerous
solutions have been proposed that seek to automate prompt engineering by using
the model itself to edit prompts. However, the majority of state-of-the-art
approaches are evaluated on tasks that require minimal prompt templates and on
very large and highly capable LLMs. In contrast, solving complex tasks that
require detailed information to be included in the prompt increases the amount
of text that needs to be optimised. Furthermore, smaller models have been shown
to be more sensitive to prompt design. To address these challenges, we propose
an evolutionary search approach to automated discrete prompt optimisation
consisting of two phases. In the first phase, grammar-guided genetic
programming is invoked to synthesise prompt-creating programmes by searching
the space of programmes populated by function compositions of syntactic,
dictionary-based and LLM-based prompt-editing functions. In the second phase,
local search is applied to explore the neighbourhoods of best-performing
programmes in an attempt to further fine-tune their performance. Our approach
outperforms three state-of-the-art prompt optimisation approaches,
PromptWizard, OPRO, and RL-Prompt, on three relatively small general-purpose
LLMs in four domain-specific challenging tasks. We also illustrate several
examples where these benchmark methods suffer relatively severe performance
degradation, while our approach improves performance in almost all task-model
combinations, only incurring minimal degradation when it does not.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Growth Bound Matrices（GBM）的新正则化技术，用于提升NLP模型对对抗攻击（如同义词替换）的鲁棒性，并首次系统分析了SSM（S4）的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管NLP领域有进展，模型仍易受对抗攻击影响，尤其是循环网络和现代状态空间模型（SSMs）的鲁棒性研究不足。

Method: 通过计算GBM来减少输入扰动对模型输出的影响，应用于LSTM、S4和CNN三种架构。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在对抗鲁棒性上比现有基线提升8.8%，优于多种先进防御方法。

Conclusion: GBM方法有效提升了NLP模型的鲁棒性，尤其在对抗攻击防御方面表现突出。

Abstract: Despite advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP), models remain
vulnerable to adversarial attacks, such as synonym substitutions. While prior
work has focused on improving robustness for feed-forward and convolutional
architectures, the robustness of recurrent networks and modern state space
models (SSMs), such as S4, remains understudied. These architectures pose
unique challenges due to their sequential processing and complex parameter
dynamics. In this paper, we introduce a novel regularization technique based on
Growth Bound Matrices (GBM) to improve NLP model robustness by reducing the
impact of input perturbations on model outputs. We focus on computing the GBM
for three architectures: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), State Space models
(S4), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Our method aims to (1) enhance
resilience against word substitution attacks, (2) improve generalization on
clean text, and (3) providing the first systematic analysis of SSM (S4)
robustness. Extensive experiments across multiple architectures and benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our method improves adversarial robustness by up to
8.8% over existing baselines. These results highlight the effectiveness of our
approach, outperforming several state-of-the-art methods in adversarial
defense. Codes are available at https://github.com/BouriMohammed/GBM

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证LLM（如GPT-4）是否能复现人类在情感意义判断中的细微差异，以评估其在语言学研究中作为辅助工具的可行性。

Method: 通过四项心理语言学实验（情感意义涌现、情感变化、情感语境下的动词选择、句子-表情符号关联），分别对人类和LLM进行相同任务测试，并进行统计分析。

Result: 人类与LLM的反应高度一致（Spearman's rho = .73-.96），仅在少数情况下存在微小差异，不影响整体解释。

Conclusion: LLM可作为语言学研究的可信赖工具，支持大规模研究，同时保持解释有效性，并为假设生成和数据扩展提供可能。

Abstract: This paper explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) as reliable
analytical tools in linguistic research, focusing on the emergence of affective
meanings in temporal expressions involving manner-of-motion verbs. While LLMs
like GPT-4 have shown promise across a range of tasks, their ability to
replicate nuanced human judgements remains under scrutiny. We conducted four
psycholinguistic studies (on emergent meanings, valence shifts, verb choice in
emotional contexts, and sentence-emoji associations) first with human
participants and then replicated the same tasks using an LLM. Results across
all studies show a striking convergence between human and AI responses, with
statistical analyses (e.g., Spearman's rho = .73-.96) indicating strong
correlations in both rating patterns and categorical choices. While minor
divergences were observed in some cases, these did not alter the overall
interpretative outcomes. These findings offer compelling evidence that LLMs can
augment traditional human-based experimentation, enabling broader-scale studies
without compromising interpretative validity. This convergence not only
strengthens the empirical foundation of prior human-based findings but also
opens possibilities for hypothesis generation and data expansion through AI.
Ultimately, our study supports the use of LLMs as credible and informative
collaborators in linguistic inquiry.

Motivation: 隐喻意义不是简单的概念映射，而是一种复杂的认知现象，需要多层次解释。

Method: 提出三层模型：内容分析、概念融合和语用意，通过统一框架实现隐喻的深层理解。

Result: 模型为计算系统提供了更丰富、更具认知基础的隐喻解释方法。

Conclusion: 该模型为隐喻理解的计算方法奠定了基础，支持更深层次、更上下文敏感的推理。

Abstract: Metaphorical meaning is not a flat mapping between concepts, but a complex
cognitive phenomenon that integrates multiple levels of interpretation. In this
paper, we propose a stratified model of metaphor processing that treats meaning
as an onion: a multi-layered structure comprising (1) content analysis, (2)
conceptual blending, and (3) pragmatic intentionality. This three-dimensional
framework allows for a richer and more cognitively grounded approach to
metaphor interpretation in computational systems. At the first level, metaphors
are annotated through basic conceptual elements. At the second level, we model
conceptual combinations, linking components to emergent meanings. Finally, at
the third level, we introduce a pragmatic vocabulary to capture speaker intent,
communicative function, and contextual effects, aligning metaphor understanding
with pragmatic theories. By unifying these layers into a single formal
framework, our model lays the groundwork for computational methods capable of
representing metaphorical meaning beyond surface associations, toward deeper,
more context-sensitive reasoning.

Result: 发现Transformer能够有效提取子结构，并展示其在处理属性图（如分子图）中的能力。

Conclusion: 研究为序列式Transformer处理图数据提供了新见解，展示了其在子结构提取任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that large language models (LLMs) possess the
capability to solve graph reasoning tasks. Notably, even when graph structures
are embedded within textual descriptions, LLMs can still effectively answer
related questions. This raises a fundamental question: How can a decoder-only
Transformer architecture understand underlying graph structures? To address
this, we start with the substructure extraction task, interpreting the inner
mechanisms inside the transformers and analyzing the impact of the input
queries. Specifically, through both empirical results and theoretical analysis,
we present Induced Substructure Filtration (ISF), a perspective that captures
the substructure identification in the multi-layer transformers. We further
validate the ISF process in LLMs, revealing consistent internal dynamics across
layers. Building on these insights, we explore the broader capabilities of
Transformers in handling diverse graph types. Specifically, we introduce the
concept of thinking in substructures to efficiently extract complex composite
patterns, and demonstrate that decoder-only Transformers can successfully
extract substructures from attributed graphs, such as molecular graphs.
Together, our findings offer a new insight on how sequence-based Transformers
perform the substructure extraction task over graph data.

Motivation: 探索LLMs在异步任务对话中提出澄清问题的能力，并与人类行为进行对比。

Method: 结合现有语料库标注，分析人类与LLMs在模糊性情境下的提问行为，并测试不同推理方法对LLMs提问的影响。

Result: 人类较少因指代模糊提问，更多因任务不确定性提问；LLMs则相反。推理能力可能提升LLMs的提问表现。

Conclusion: LLMs的提问能力可能与推理能力相关，但与人类行为存在显著差异。

Abstract: In this work we examine LLMs' ability to ask clarification questions in
task-oriented dialogues that follow the asynchronous
instruction-giver/instruction-follower format. We present a new corpus that
combines two existing annotations of the Minecraft Dialogue Corpus -- one for
reference and ambiguity in reference, and one for SDRT including clarifications
-- into a single common format providing the necessary information to
experiment with clarifications and their relation to ambiguity. With this
corpus we compare LLM actions with original human-generated clarification
questions, examining how both humans and LLMs act in the case of ambiguity. We
find that there is only a weak link between ambiguity and humans producing
clarification questions in these dialogues, and low correlation between humans
and LLMs. Humans hardly ever produce clarification questions for referential
ambiguity, but often do so for task-based uncertainty. Conversely, LLMs produce
more clarification questions for referential ambiguity, but less so for task
uncertainty. We question if LLMs' ability to ask clarification questions is
predicated on their recent ability to simulate reasoning, and test this with
different reasoning approaches, finding that reasoning does appear to increase
question frequency and relevancy.

Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative Applicant Tracking System (ATS) enhanced
by a novel Robotic process automation (RPA) framework or as further referred to
as MLAR. Traditional recruitment processes often encounter bottlenecks in
resume screening and candidate shortlisting due to time and resource
constraints. MLAR addresses these challenges employing Large Language Models
(LLMs) in three distinct layers: extracting key characteristics from job
postings in the first layer, parsing applicant resume to identify education,
experience, skills in the second layer, and similarity matching in the third
layer. These features are then matched through advanced semantic algorithms to
identify the best candidates efficiently. Our approach integrates seamlessly
into existing RPA pipelines, automating resume parsing, job matching, and
candidate notifications. Extensive performance benchmarking shows that MLAR
outperforms the leading RPA platforms, including UiPath and Automation
Anywhere, in high-volume resume-processing tasks. When processing 2,400
resumes, MLAR achieved an average processing time of 5.4 seconds per resume,
reducing processing time by approximately 16.9% compared to Automation Anywhere
and 17.1% compared to UiPath. These results highlight the potential of MLAR to
transform recruitment workflows by providing an efficient, accurate, and

Method: 使用2000个样本，比较LLaDA和LLaMA在困惑度、突发性、词汇多样性、可读性及BLEU/ROUGE分数上的表现。

Result: LLaDA在困惑度和突发性上接近人类文本，导致自回归检测器的高假阴性率；LLaMA困惑度低但词汇保真度差。单一指标无法区分扩散输出与人类写作。

Conclusion: 需开发针对扩散模型的检测技术，如混合模型、扩散特定风格特征和鲁棒水印。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has raised concerns
about reliably detecting AI-generated text. Stylometric metrics work well on
autoregressive (AR) outputs, but their effectiveness on diffusion-based models
is unknown. We present the first systematic comparison of diffusion-generated
text (LLaDA) and AR-generated text (LLaMA) using 2 000 samples. Perplexity,
burstiness, lexical diversity, readability, and BLEU/ROUGE scores show that
LLaDA closely mimics human text in perplexity and burstiness, yielding high
false-negative rates for AR-oriented detectors. LLaMA shows much lower
perplexity but reduced lexical fidelity. Relying on any single metric fails to
separate diffusion outputs from human writing. We highlight the need for
diffusion-aware detectors and outline directions such as hybrid models,
diffusion-specific stylometric signatures, and robust watermarking.

Motivation: 解决语言模型扩展时计算和内存需求高的问题，同时实现参数共享和自适应计算。

Method: MoR 通过共享层和轻量级路由器动态分配递归深度，选择性缓存活跃token的键值对，并提出KV共享变体以减少预填充延迟和内存占用。

Result: 在135M到1.7B参数范围内，MoR在相同训练FLOPs下显著降低验证困惑度，提高少样本准确率，并提升吞吐量。

Conclusion: MoR 是实现高质量大模型而不增加成本的有效路径。

Abstract: Scaling language models unlocks impressive capabilities, but the accompanying
computational and memory demands make both training and deployment expensive.
Existing efficiency efforts typically target either parameter sharing or
adaptive computation, leaving open the question of how to attain both
simultaneously. We introduce Mixture-of-Recursions (MoR), a unified framework
that combines the two axes of efficiency inside a single Recursive Transformer.
MoR reuses a shared stack of layers across recursion steps to achieve parameter
efficiency, while lightweight routers enable adaptive token-level thinking by
dynamically assigning different recursion depths to individual tokens. This
allows MoR to focus quadratic attention computation only among tokens still
active at a given recursion depth, further improving memory access efficiency
by selectively caching only their key-value pairs. Beyond these core
mechanisms, we also propose a KV sharing variant that reuses KV pairs from the
first recursion, specifically designed to decrease prefill latency and memory
footprint. Across model scales ranging from 135M to 1.7B parameters, MoR forms
a new Pareto frontier: at equal training FLOPs and smaller model sizes, it
significantly lowers validation perplexity and improves few-shot accuracy,
while delivering higher throughput compared with vanilla and existing recursive
baselines. These gains demonstrate that MoR is an effective path towards
large-model quality without incurring large-model cost.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了LLM作为评判者在编码任务中的有效性，并提出了CodeJudgeBench基准测试，发现思维模型表现更优，但评判存在随机性和敏感性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏专用基准测试，LLM作为评判者在编码任务中的有效性尚未充分研究。

Method: 引入CodeJudgeBench基准测试，评估26个LLM评判模型在代码生成、修复和单元测试生成任务中的表现。

Result: 思维模型显著优于非思维模型，但评判存在随机性和敏感性；成对比较和保留完整响应可提升性能。

Conclusion: LLM作为评判者在编码任务中表现不稳定，需优化提示策略以提高可靠性和一致性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the state-of-the-art
in various coding tasks. Beyond directly answering user queries, LLMs can also
serve as judges, assessing and comparing the quality of responses generated by
other models. Such an evaluation capability is crucial both for benchmarking
different LLMs and for improving response quality through response ranking.
However, despite the growing adoption of the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm, its
effectiveness in coding scenarios remains underexplored due to the absence of
dedicated benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce CodeJudgeBench, a
benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate the performance of LLM-as-a-Judge
models across three critical coding tasks: code generation, code repair, and
unit test generation. Through comprehensive benchmarking of 26 LLM-as-a-Judge
models, we find that recent thinking models significantly outperform
non-thinking models on our carefully designed code judging tasks. Notably, even
relatively small thinking models, such as Qwen3-8B, can outperform specially
trained LLM-as-a-Judge models up to 70B in size. Nevertheless, all models still
exhibit significant randomness in their judgment of coding tasks. For pairwise
judging tasks, simply changing the order in which responses are presented can
substantially impact accuracy. In addition, when judging code and unit tests
written by different LLMs, LLM-as-a-Judge models also show variance in
performance. This sensitivity raises concerns about the reliability and
consistency of LLM-as-a-Judge in coding scenarios. Lastly, we study optimal
prompting strategies for LLM-as-a-Judge. We find that using pair-wise
comparison outperforms scalar point-wise judging. Furthermore, retaining
comments and reasoning in the full, unprocessed LLM response leads to improved
judge performance.

TL;DR: REST框架通过同时测试多个问题，评估大型推理模型在压力下的表现，揭示了现有基准测试的局限性，并提供了更接近真实场景的评估方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要评估单问题推理，存在数据污染和评估能力不足的问题，无法反映模型在多上下文压力下的表现。

Method: 提出REST框架，同时暴露模型于多个问题，评估其优先级分配、干扰抵抗和认知负载管理等能力。

Result: 即使SOTA模型在压力测试下表现显著下降，REST显示出更强的区分能力，揭示了模型间的性能差异。

Conclusion: REST是一种高效、面向未来的评估范式，减少对人类标注的依赖，更贴近真实推理需求。

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable progress on
task-specific benchmarks, yet their evaluation methods remain constrained by
isolated problem-solving paradigms. Existing benchmarks predominantly assess
single-question reasoning through sequential testing, resulting critical
limitations: (1) vulnerability to data contamination and less challenging
(e.g., DeepSeek-R1 achieves 97.0% on MATH500), forcing costly and perpetual
creation of new questions with large human efforts, (2) failure to evaluate
models under multi-context pressure, a key requirement for real-world
deployment. To bridge this gap, we present REST (Reasoning Evaluation through
Simultaneous Testing), a stress-testing framework that concurrently exposes
LRMs to multiple problems simultaneously. Beyond basic reasoning, REST
specifically evaluates several under-tested capabilities: contextual priority
allocation, cross-problem interference resistance, and dynamic cognitive load
management. Our evaluation reveals several striking findings: Even
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models like DeepSeek-R1 exhibit substantial performance
degradation under stress testing. Crucially, REST demonstrates stronger
discriminative power than existing benchmarks, revealing pronounced performance
differences among models that exhibit similar, near-ceiling performance under
single-question evaluations. Some key mechanistic insights emerge from our
analysis: (1) the "overthinking trap" is a critical factor contributing to the
performance degradation; (2) the models trained with "long2short" technique
preserve more accuracy of their single-problem performance under REST,
outperforming standard-trained counterparts. These results establish REST as a
cost-efficient, future-proof evaluation paradigm that better reflects
real-world reasoning demands while reducing reliance on continuous human
annotation.

inherent in anime art. We present an interactive drawing guidance system
specifically designed for anime illustrations to address this issue. It offers
real-time guidance to help users refine their work and streamline the creative

images into rough sketches, which are further refined into structured guidance
sketches using a custom-designed optimizer. The proposed system offers precise,
real-time guidance aligned with the creative intent of the user, significantly
enhancing both the efficiency and accuracy of the drawing process. To assess
the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted a user study, gathering
empirical feedback on both system performance and interface usability.

Motivation: 控制复杂流体行为具有挑战性，现有生成模型虽能直观生成矢量场，但难以保持物理属性（如不可压缩性）。

Method: 两阶段方法：1）使用潜在扩散模型（LDM）从用户草图生成初始矢量场；2）通过Helmholtz-Hodge分解局部提取物理属性并重新组合。

Result: 实验证明了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法成功结合了直观生成与物理属性保持，为流体模拟提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Fluid simulation techniques are widely used in various fields such as film
production, but controlling complex fluid behaviors remains challenging. While
recent generative models enable intuitive generation of vector fields from user
sketches, they struggle to maintain physical properties such as
incompressibility. To address these issues, this paper proposes a method for
interactively designing 2D vector fields. Conventional generative models can
intuitively generate vector fields from user sketches, but remain difficult to
consider physical properties. Therefore, we add a simple editing process after
generating the vector field. In the first stage, we use a latent diffusion
model~(LDM) to automatically generate initial 2D vector fields from user
sketches. In the second stage, we apply the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition to
locally extract physical properties such as incompressibility from the results
generated by LDM and recompose them according to user intentions. Through
multiple experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Abstract: High-resolution image synthesis with diffusion models often suffers from
energy instabilities and guidance artifacts that degrade visual quality. We
analyze the latent energy landscape during sampling and propose adaptive

yields optimal performance, providing sharper, more faithful images while
reducing artifacts. Our energy profiling framework serves as a powerful
diagnostic tool for understanding and improving diffusion model behavior.

Conclusion: 方法支持用户主动控制运动方向，生成个性化的交互路径。

Abstract: We propose a real-time method for reactive motion synthesis based on the
known trajectory of input character, predicting instant reactions using only
historical, user-controlled motions. Our method handles the uncertainty of
future movements by introducing an intention predictor, which forecasts key
joint intentions to make pose prediction more deterministic from the historical
interaction. The intention is later encoded into the latent space of its
reactive motion, matched with a codebook which represents mappings between
input and output. It samples a categorical distribution for pose generation and
strengthens model robustness through adversarial training. Unlike previous
offline approaches, the system can recursively generate intentions and reactive
motions using feedback from earlier steps, enabling real-time, long-term
realistic interactive synthesis. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments
show our approach outperforms other matching-based motion synthesis approaches,
delivering superior stability and generalizability. In our method, user can
also actively influence the outcome by controlling the moving directions,
creating a personalized interaction path that deviates from predefined
trajectories.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CAD建模通常耗时且依赖人工，现有方法未能充分利用LLMs的潜力。论文旨在通过LLMs实现文本驱动的CAD生成，提高设计效率。

Method: 构建了一个包含17万多个CAD模型的数据集，使用GPT-4.1生成高质量描述，并微调代码-LLMs以生成JSON格式的CAD序列。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效自动化CAD设计，显著加快新对象的设计速度，并通过新指标提供了更丰富的结构评估。

Conclusion: 论文证明了LLMs在CAD生成中的可行性和有效性，为未来研究提供了数据集和模型支持。

Abstract: Computer-aided design (CAD) is the digital construction of 2D and 3D objects,
and is central to a wide range of engineering and manufacturing applications
like automobile and aviation. Despite its importance, CAD modeling remains
largely a time-intensive, manual task. Recent works have attempted to automate
this process with small transformer-based models and handcrafted CAD sequence
representations. However, there has been little effort to leverage the
potential of large language models (LLMs) for sequential CAD design. In this
work, we introduce a new large-scale dataset of more than 170k CAD models
annotated with high-quality, human-like descriptions generated with our
pipeline based on GPT-4.1. Using this dataset, we fine-tune powerful code-LLMs
to generate CAD sequences represented in a JSON-based format from natural
language descriptions, demonstrating the viability and effectiveness of this
approach for text-conditioned CAD generation. Because simple metrics often fail
to reflect the quality of generated objects, we introduce geometric and
topological metrics based on sphericity, mean curvature, and Euler
characteristic to provide richer structural insights. Our experiments and
ablation studies on both synthetic and human-annotated data demonstrate that
CADmium is able to automate CAD design, drastically speeding up the design of
new objects. The dataset, code, and fine-tuned models are available online.

Conclusion: 该方法通过局部表情与3D高斯泼溅的结合，显著提升了3D头部虚拟形象的逼真度和表现力。

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity real-time animated sequences of photorealistic 3D
head avatars is important for many graphics applications, including immersive
telepresence and movies. This is a challenging problem particularly when
rendering digital avatar close-ups for showing character's facial microfeatures
and expressions. To capture the expressive, detailed nature of human heads,
including skin furrowing and finer-scale facial movements, we propose to couple
locally-defined facial expressions with 3D Gaussian splatting to enable
creating ultra-high fidelity, expressive and photorealistic 3D head avatars. In
contrast to previous works that operate on a global expression space, we
condition our avatar's dynamics on patch-based local expression features and
synthesize 3D Gaussians at a patch level. In particular, we leverage a
patch-based geometric 3D face model to extract patch expressions and learn how
to translate these into local dynamic skin appearance and motion by coupling
the patches with anchor points of Scaffold-GS, a recent hierarchical scene
representation. These anchors are then used to synthesize 3D Gaussians
on-the-fly, conditioned by patch-expressions and viewing direction. We employ
color-based densification and progressive training to obtain high-quality
results and faster convergence for high resolution 3K training images. By
leveraging patch-level expressions, ScaffoldAvatar consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance with visually natural motion, while encompassing
diverse facial expressions and styles in real time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观察到现有大语言模型在长链推理中存在冗余注意力问题，尤其是错误答案中注意力稀疏性更高，影响了推理性能。

Method: 通过测量特殊‘思考结束’标记的注意力分数识别冗余，采用结构感知剪枝去除低贡献推理块，随后恢复推理生成。

Result: 方法显著提升了推理密集型任务的准确性，尤其在数学竞赛（如AIME和AMC）中表现突出。

Conclusion: 去除冗余注意力可有效提升推理性能，无需额外训练，适用于复杂推理任务。

Abstract: Recent large language models have shown promising capabilities in long-form
reasoning, following structured chains of thought before arriving at a final
answer. However, we observe that these reasoning paths tend to include
substantial redundancy; analyzing attention patterns reveals that attention
scores are widely scattered, particularly incorrect answers exhibit greater
attention sparsity. In this paper, we demonstrate that deliberately removing
this redundancy in the reasoning process significantly improves performance
through clear thinking, i.e., removing distraction. Specifically, we
systematically identify reasoning redundancy by measuring token-level attention
scores to a special end-of-thinking token, which is appended to an explicit
instruction inserted to conclude each intermediate reasoning step. Furthermore,
we propose structure-aware pruning that prioritizes removing tokens in
low-contributing reasoning chunks over individual tokens. After evicting
redundant tokens, we remove the injected end-of-thinking instruction, then
resume the reasoning generation. We demonstrate that our method significantly
improves overall accuracy across reasoning-intensive benchmarks without any
training involved. In particular, our method shows strong performance on
challenging mathematical competition benchmarks such as AIME and AMC, where
reasoning redundancy is more prevalent.

Motivation: 现有MCA方法依赖假设和主观判断，且常采用同质性假设，影响评估效果。需结合定量和定性准则以应对复杂评估挑战。

Method: 结合两种VGA模型，基于线性编程框架，提出新的MCA方法。

Result: 通过两个数值示例验证了方法的准确性和透明度。

Conclusion: 该方法为自动化决策系统和决策支持系统提供了强大且灵活的解决方案，推动了该领域的进步。

Abstract: Modern methods for multi-criteria assessment (MCA), such as Data Envelopment
Analysis (DEA), Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA), and Multiple Criteria
Decision-Making (MCDM), are utilized to appraise a collection of
Decision-Making Units (DMUs), also known as alternatives, based on several
criteria. These methodologies inherently rely on assumptions and can be
influenced by subjective judgment to effectively tackle the complex evaluation
challenges in various fields. In real-world scenarios, it is essential to
incorporate both quantitative and qualitative criteria as they consist of
cardinal and ordinal data. Despite the inherent variability in the criterion
values of different alternatives, the homogeneity assumption is often employed,
significantly affecting evaluations. To tackle these challenges and determine
the most appropriate alternative, we propose a novel MCA approach that combines
two Virtual Gap Analysis (VGA) models. The VGA framework, rooted in linear
programming, is pivotal in the MCA methodology. This approach improves
efficiency and fairness, ensuring that evaluations are both comprehensive and
dependable, thus offering a strong and adaptive solution. Two comprehensive
numerical examples demonstrate the accuracy and transparency of our proposed
method. The goal is to encourage continued advancement and stimulate progress
in automated decision systems and decision support systems.

Abstract: Generative AI can be used in multi-actor environments with purposes ranging
from social science modeling to interactive narrative and AI evaluation.
Supporting this diversity of use cases -- which we classify as Simulationist,
Dramatist, and Evaluationist -- demands a flexible scenario definition
framework. We argue here that a good approach is to take inspiration from
tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs), where a Game Master (GM) is responsible
for the environment and generates all parts of the story not directly
determined by the voluntary actions of player characters. We argue that the
Entity-Component architectural pattern is useful here. In such a system, the GM
is not a hardcoded computer game but is itself a configurable entity, composed
of components just like any other actor. By design, the approach allows for a
separation between the underlying implementation details handled by an
engineer, the creation of reusable components, and their composition and
configuration managed by a designer who constructs entities from the
components. This separation of concerns is instrumental for achieving rapid
iteration, maintaining modularity, and ultimately to ensure scalability. We
describe the ongoing evolution of the Concordia library in terms of this
philosophy, demonstrating how it allows users to effectively configure
scenarios that align with their specific goals.

Abstract: The accelerating loss of biodiversity presents critical challenges for
ecological research and conservation strategies. The preservation of
biodiversity is paramount for maintaining ecological balance and ensuring the
sustainability of ecosystems. However, biodiversity faces numerous threats,
including habitat loss, climate change, and the proliferation of invasive
species. Addressing these and other ecology-related challenges, both at local
and global scales, requires comprehensive monitoring, predictive and
conservation planning capabilities. Artificial Intelligence (AI) Foundation
Models (FMs) have gained significant momentum in numerous scientific domains by
leveraging vast datasets to learn general-purpose representations adaptable to
various downstream tasks. This paradigm holds immense promise for biodiversity
conservation. In response, we introduce BioAnalyst, the first Foundation Model
tailored for biodiversity analysis and conservation planning. BioAnalyst
employs a transformer-based architecture, pre-trained on extensive multi-modal
datasets encompassing species occurrence records, remote sensing indicators,
climate and environmental variables. BioAnalyst is designed for adaptability,
allowing for fine-tuning of a range of downstream tasks, such as species
distribution modelling, habitat suitability assessments, invasive species
detection, and population trend forecasting. We evaluate the model's
performance on two downstream use cases, demonstrating its generalisability
compared to existing methods, particularly in data-scarce scenarios for two
distinct use-cases, establishing a new accuracy baseline for ecological
forecasting. By openly releasing BioAnalyst and its fine-tuning workflows to
the scientific community, we aim to foster collaborative efforts in
biodiversity modelling and advance AI-driven solutions to pressing ecological
challenges.

Motivation: 研究AI工具在真实软件开发中对开发者生产力的影响。

Method: 通过随机对照试验（RCT），16名有中等AI经验的开发者完成246项任务，随机允许或禁止使用2025年的AI工具（如Cursor Pro和Claude 3.5/3.7 Sonnet）。

Result: 允许使用AI工具时，任务完成时间增加了19%，与开发者预期的20%缩短和专家预测的38%-39%缩短相反。

Conclusion: AI工具在实际使用中可能因多种因素（如项目规模、质量标准或开发者经验）而降低生产力，而非提升。

Abstract: Despite widespread adoption, the impact of AI tools on software development
in the wild remains understudied. We conduct a randomized controlled trial
(RCT) to understand how AI tools at the February-June 2025 frontier affect the
productivity of experienced open-source developers. 16 developers with moderate
AI experience complete 246 tasks in mature projects on which they have an
average of 5 years of prior experience. Each task is randomly assigned to allow
or disallow usage of early 2025 AI tools. When AI tools are allowed, developers
primarily use Cursor Pro, a popular code editor, and Claude 3.5/3.7 Sonnet.
Before starting tasks, developers forecast that allowing AI will reduce
completion time by 24%. After completing the study, developers estimate that
allowing AI reduced completion time by 20%. Surprisingly, we find that allowing
AI actually increases completion time by 19%--AI tooling slowed developers
down. This slowdown also contradicts predictions from experts in economics (39%
shorter) and ML (38% shorter). To understand this result, we collect and
evaluate evidence for 20 properties of our setting that a priori could
contribute to the observed slowdown effect--for example, the size and quality
standards of projects, or prior developer experience with AI tooling. Although
the influence of experimental artifacts cannot be entirely ruled out, the
robustness of the slowdown effect across our analyses suggests it is unlikely
to primarily be a function of our experimental design.

Conclusion: 该研究为去中心化市场情报提供了新范式，结合多智能体系统和金融监控，推动了开放研究和可重复性。

Abstract: Decentralized finance (DeFi) has introduced a new era of permissionless
financial innovation but also led to unprecedented market manipulation. Without
centralized oversight, malicious actors coordinate shilling campaigns and
pump-and-dump schemes across various platforms. We propose a Multi-Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework for decentralized manipulation
detection, modeling the interaction between manipulators and detectors as a
dynamic adversarial game. This framework identifies suspicious patterns using
delayed token price reactions as financial indicators.Our method introduces
three innovations: (1) Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance
learning stability in sparse-reward and partially observable settings; (2) a
theory-based reward function inspired by rational expectations and information
asymmetry, differentiating price discovery from manipulation noise; and (3) a
multi-modal agent pipeline that integrates LLM-based semantic features, social
graph signals, and on-chain market data for informed decision-making.The
framework is integrated within the Symphony system, a decentralized multi-agent
architecture enabling peer-to-peer agent execution and trust-aware learning
through distributed logs, supporting chain-verifiable evaluation. Symphony
promotes adversarial co-evolution among strategic actors and maintains robust
manipulation detection without centralized oracles, enabling real-time
surveillance across global DeFi ecosystems.Trained on 100,000 real-world

*Matous Kozak,Roshanak Zilouchian Moghaddam,Siva Sivaraman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-based coding agents may introduce security risks; a study of 12,000 actions across 5 models found 21% insecure actions, with GPT-4.1 showing high mitigation success (96.8%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the security implications of LLM-based coding agents in software development, as their rapid deployment lacks comprehensive security evaluation.

Method: Analyzed over 12,000 actions from five state-of-the-art models (e.g., GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, Claude variants) on 93 real-world software setup tasks, developing a detection system for vulnerabilities.

Result: 21% of agent actions were insecure, with information exposure (CWE-200) being most common. GPT-4.1 showed 96.8% mitigation success with security reminders.

Conclusion: The study highlights significant security risks in LLM-based coding agents and underscores the need for security-aware design in future developments.

Abstract: LLM-based coding agents are rapidly being deployed in software development,
yet their security implications remain poorly understood. These agents, while
capable of accelerating software development, may inadvertently introduce
insecure practices. We conducted the first systematic security evaluation of
autonomous coding agents, analyzing over 12,000 actions across five
state-of-the-art models (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, Claude variants) on 93 real-world
software setup tasks. Our findings reveal significant security concerns: 21% of
agent trajectories contained insecure actions, with models showing substantial
variation in security behavior. We developed a high-precision detection system
that identified four major vulnerability categories, with information exposure
(CWE-200) being the most prevalent one. We also evaluated mitigation strategies
including feedback mechanisms and security reminders with various effectiveness
between models. GPT-4.1 demonstrated exceptional security awareness with 96.8%
mitigation success. Our work provides the first comprehensive framework for
evaluating coding agent security and highlights the need for security-aware
design of next generation LLM-based coding agents.

TL;DR: EduFlow是一个端到端框架，通过EduPRM和EduMCTS提升多模态大语言模型在科学任务中的推理能力，解决了推理模式不足、全局连贯性缺失和自校正缺乏的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在科学任务中表现不佳，尤其是在需要多步和可解释推理的场景中。现有模型缺乏科学推理模式、全局连贯性和自校正能力。

Method: 提出EduFlow框架，包括EduPRM（过程感知奖励模型）和EduMCTS（领域适应搜索框架），通过课程学习和自反射机制优化推理轨迹。

Result: 实验表明EduFlow显著提升了推理的一致性和连贯性，并构建了EduMCTS-160K数据集。

Conclusion: EduFlow为科学推理任务提供了一种有效的解决方案，未来将公开代码、数据和模型。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) still perform poorly on scientific
tasks, particularly those requiring multi-step and interpretable reasoning.
Their limitations include insufficient scientific reasoning patterns, lack of
global coherence in multi-step inference, and the absence of reflective
self-correction, making them unreliable in structured scientific contexts. We
introduce EduFlow, the first end-to-end framework that covers the full pipeline
of educational scientific reasoning, including data selection, MCTS-based
trajectory construction, model training, and output optimization. At its core
is EduPRM, a process-aware reward model that critiques reasoning steps with
tags and justifications. EduPRM is trained via curriculum learning on three
complementary supervision sources: MCTS-guided trajectories, error-injected
critiques, and teacher-student dialogues, enabling dynamic adaptation to
multi-stage problem solving and iterative refinement during inference. We
further propose EduMCTS, a domain-adapted search framework that introduces
bootstrapping actions specifically designed for educational reasoning, such as
a self-reflection mechanism that promotes reflective error correction. It
further leverages EduPRM's fine-grained feedback to guide the search toward
higher-quality reasoning trajectories. By applying self-consistency and
rejection sampling, we constructed EduMCTS-160K, a large-scale dataset of
educational reasoning trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
EduFlow enhances reasoning consistency and coherence. Code, data, and models
will be released.

Conclusion: 研究为设计可转移且可解释的神经符号AI系统提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Explainability and interpretability are cornerstones of frontier and
next-generation artificial intelligence (AI) systems. This is especially true
in recent systems, such as large language models (LLMs), and more broadly,
generative AI. On the other hand, adaptability to new domains, contexts, or
scenarios is also an important aspect for a successful system. As such, we are
particularly interested in how we can merge these two efforts, that is,
investigating the design of transferable and interpretable neurosymbolic AI
systems. Specifically, we focus on a class of systems referred to as ''Agentic
Retrieval-Augmented Generation'' systems, which actively select, interpret, and
query knowledge sources in response to natural language prompts. In this paper,
we systematically evaluate how different conceptualizations and representations
of knowledge, particularly the structure and complexity, impact an AI agent (in
this case, an LLM) in effectively querying a triplestore. We report our
results, which show that there are impacts from both approaches, and we discuss
their impact and implications.

Motivation: 传统Stackelberg游戏假设完全信息和理性行为者，而现实中的决策往往涉及有限理性和信息不对称。本文旨在通过LLMs模拟更真实的策略互动。

Method: 提出LLM-Stackelberg游戏框架，利用结构化提示和LLMs生成行为，定义推理均衡和行为均衡，并通过钓鱼案例验证。

Result: 框架成功捕捉了有限理性、信息不对称和元认知适应，展示了在网络安全等领域的应用价值。

Conclusion: LLM-Stackelberg游戏为建模复杂决策提供了新范式，尤其在涉及认知和对抗的领域具有潜力。

Abstract: We introduce the framework of LLM-Stackelberg games, a class of sequential
decision-making models that integrate large language models (LLMs) into
strategic interactions between a leader and a follower. Departing from
classical Stackelberg assumptions of complete information and rational agents,
our formulation allows each agent to reason through structured prompts,
generate probabilistic behaviors via LLMs, and adapt their strategies through
internal cognition and belief updates. We define two equilibrium concepts:
reasoning and behavioral equilibrium, which aligns an agent's internal
prompt-based reasoning with observable behavior, and conjectural reasoning
equilibrium, which accounts for epistemic uncertainty through parameterized
models over an opponent's response. These layered constructs capture bounded
rationality, asymmetric information, and meta-cognitive adaptation. We
illustrate the framework through a spearphishing case study, where a sender and
a recipient engage in a deception game using structured reasoning prompts. This
example highlights the cognitive richness and adversarial potential of
LLM-mediated interactions. Our results show that LLM-Stackelberg games provide
a powerful paradigm for modeling decision-making in domains such as
cybersecurity, misinformation, and recommendation systems.

Motivation: 传统方法难以解决多智能体强化学习中的联合动作空间爆炸、非平稳环境和部分可观测性问题，反应式方法在应对新场景时失效。

Method: 通过生成式AI的强化学习，将智能体重新定义为能够合成复杂动态并基于预测进行前瞻性决策的生成模型。

Result: 生成式强化学习智能体能够建模环境演化、预测其他智能体行为、生成协调动作序列，并进行长期动态的战略推理。

Conclusion: 这一范式转变有望实现真正的协作智能，解决传统反应式框架无法处理的协调问题，应用于自主系统、机器人和人机协作等领域。

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning faces fundamental challenges that
conventional approaches have failed to overcome: exponentially growing joint
action spaces, non-stationary environments where simultaneous learning creates
moving targets, and partial observability that constrains coordination. Current
methods remain reactive, employing stimulus-response mechanisms that fail when
facing novel scenarios. We argue for a transformative paradigm shift from
reactive to proactive multi-agent intelligence through generative AI-based
reinforcement learning. This position advocates reconceptualizing agents not as
isolated policy optimizers, but as sophisticated generative models capable of
synthesizing complex multi-agent dynamics and making anticipatory decisions
based on predictive understanding of future interactions. Rather than
responding to immediate observations, generative-RL agents can model
environment evolution, predict other agents' behaviors, generate coordinated
action sequences, and engage in strategic reasoning accounting for long-term
dynamics. This approach leverages pattern recognition and generation
capabilities of generative AI to enable proactive decision-making, seamless
coordination through enhanced communication, and dynamic adaptation to evolving
scenarios. We envision this paradigm shift will unlock unprecedented
possibilities for distributed intelligence, moving beyond individual
optimization toward emergent collective behaviors representing genuine
collaborative intelligence. The implications extend across autonomous systems,
robotics, and human-AI collaboration, promising solutions to coordination
challenges intractable under traditional reactive frameworks.

Motivation: 现有扩散模型在规划中计算成本高，CTP旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用一致性轨迹模型（CTM）进行单步轨迹优化。

Result: 在D4RL基准测试中，CTP性能优于现有扩散方法，且推理速度快120倍。

Conclusion: CTP是一种高效、低延迟的离线规划方法。

Abstract: This paper introduces Consistency Trajectory Planning (CTP), a novel offline
model-based reinforcement learning method that leverages the recently proposed
Consistency Trajectory Model (CTM) for efficient trajectory optimization. While
prior work applying diffusion models to planning has demonstrated strong
performance, it often suffers from high computational costs due to iterative
sampling procedures. CTP supports fast, single-step trajectory generation
without significant degradation in policy quality. We evaluate CTP on the D4RL
benchmark and show that it consistently outperforms existing diffusion-based
planning methods in long-horizon, goal-conditioned tasks. Notably, CTP achieves
higher normalized returns while using significantly fewer denoising steps. In
particular, CTP achieves comparable performance with over $120\times$ speedup
in inference time, demonstrating its practicality and effectiveness for
high-performance, low-latency offline planning.

Motivation: 解决SNN在强化学习中由于脉冲通信不可微分性带来的训练挑战，提供一种无需梯度的替代方案。

Method: 使用Metropolis-Hastings采样方法，基于累积奖励信号迭代更新网络参数，绕过反向传播的限制。

Result: 在AcroBot和CartPole基准测试中，该方法在最大化累积奖励、减少网络资源和训练次数方面优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 提出的MH采样框架为SNN在强化学习中的训练提供了一种高效且资源友好的替代方案。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer biologically inspired, energy-efficient
alternatives to traditional Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for real-time control
systems. However, their training presents several challenges, particularly for
reinforcement learning (RL) tasks, due to the non-differentiable nature of
spike-based communication. In this work, we introduce what is, to our
knowledge, the first framework that employs Metropolis-Hastings (MH) sampling,
a Bayesian inference technique, to train SNNs for dynamical agent control in RL
environments without relying on gradient-based methods. Our approach
iteratively proposes and probabilistically accepts network parameter updates
based on accumulated reward signals, effectively circumventing the limitations
of backpropagation while enabling direct optimization on neuromorphic
platforms. We evaluated this framework on two standard control benchmarks:
AcroBot and CartPole. The results demonstrate that our MH-based approach
outperforms conventional Deep Q-Learning (DQL) baselines and prior SNN-based RL
approaches in terms of maximizing the accumulated reward while minimizing
network resources and training episodes.

Conclusion: 神经符号框架能有效提升机器人系统的互操作性，但模型选择和集成策略至关重要。

Abstract: Personal service robots are deployed to support daily living in domestic
environments, particularly for elderly and individuals requiring assistance.
These robots must perceive complex and dynamic surroundings, understand tasks,
and execute context-appropriate actions. However, current systems rely on
proprietary, hard-coded solutions tied to specific hardware and software,
resulting in siloed implementations that are difficult to adapt and scale
across platforms. Ontologies and Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer a solution to
enable interoperability across systems, through structured and standardized
representations of knowledge and reasoning. However, symbolic systems such as
KGs and ontologies struggle with raw and noisy sensory input. In contrast,
multimodal language models are well suited for interpreting input such as
images and natural language, but often lack transparency, consistency, and
knowledge grounding. In this work, we propose a neurosymbolic framework that
combines the perceptual strengths of multimodal language models with the
structured representations provided by KGs and ontologies, with the aim of
supporting interoperability in robotic applications. Our approach generates
ontology-compliant KGs that can inform robot behavior in a platform-independent
manner. We evaluated this framework by integrating robot perception data,
ontologies, and five multimodal models (three LLaMA and two GPT models), using
different modes of neural-symbolic interaction. We assess the consistency and
effectiveness of the generated KGs across multiple runs and configurations, and
perform statistical analyzes to evaluate performance. Results show that GPT-o1
and LLaMA 4 Maverick consistently outperform other models. However, our
findings also indicate that newer models do not guarantee better results,
highlighting the critical role of the integration strategy in generating
ontology-compliant KGs.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems often interact with multiple agents. The
regulation of such AI systems often requires that {\em a priori\/} guarantees
of fairness and robustness be satisfied. With stochastic models of agents'
responses to the outputs of AI systems, such {\em a priori\/} guarantees
require non-trivial reasoning about the corresponding stochastic systems. Here,
we present an open-source PyTorch-based toolkit for the use of stochastic
control techniques in modelling interconnections of AI systems and properties
of their repeated uses. It models robustness and fairness desiderata in a
closed-loop fashion, and provides {\em a priori\/} guarantees for these
interconnections. The PyTorch-based toolkit removes much of the complexity
associated with the provision of fairness guarantees for closed-loop models of
multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) like OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek R1 have
demonstrated impressive performance on complex reasoning tasks like mathematics
and programming with long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning sequences
(slow-thinking), compared with traditional large language models
(fast-thinking). However, these reasoning models also face a huge challenge
that generating unnecessarily lengthy and redundant reasoning chains even for
trivial questions. This phenomenon leads to a significant waste of inference
resources, increases the response time for simple queries, and hinders the
practical application of LRMs in real-world products. To this end, it is
crucial to shorten lengthy reasoning chains and learn adaptive reasoning
between fast and slow thinking based on input difficulty. In this survey, we
provide a comprehensive overview of recent progress in concise and adaptive
thinking for efficient reasoning of LRMs, including methodologies, benchmarks,
and challenges for future exploration. We hope this survey can help researchers
quickly understand the landscape of this field and inspire novel adaptive
thinking ideas to facilitate better usage of LRMs.

Result: Causal DQ显著减少了异常检测时间，适用于大规模实时数据流。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅有效，还为其他强化学习问题提供了因果信息整合的新思路。

Abstract: Nowadays, as AI-driven manufacturing becomes increasingly popular, the volume
of data streams requiring real-time monitoring continues to grow. However, due
to limited resources, it is impractical to place sensors at every location to
detect unexpected shifts. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an optimal
sensor placement strategy that enables partial observability of the system
while detecting anomalies as quickly as possible. Numerous approaches have been
proposed to address this challenge; however, most existing methods consider
only variable correlations and neglect a crucial factor: Causality. Moreover,
although a few techniques incorporate causal analysis, they rely on
interventions-artificially creating anomalies-to identify causal effects, which
is impractical and might lead to catastrophic losses. In this paper, we
introduce a causality-informed deep Q-network (Causal DQ) approach for
partially observable sensor placement in anomaly detection. By integrating
causal information at each stage of Q-network training, our method achieves
faster convergence and tighter theoretical error bounds. Furthermore, the
trained causal-informed Q-network significantly reduces the detection time for
anomalies under various settings, demonstrating its effectiveness for sensor
placement in large-scale, real-world data streams. Beyond the current
implementation, our technique's fundamental insights can be applied to various
reinforcement learning problems, opening up new possibilities for real-world
causality-informed machine learning methods in engineering applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
natural language understanding and generation, but they exhibit problems with
logical consistency in the output they generate. How can we harness LLMs'
broad-coverage parametric knowledge in formal reasoning despite their
inconsistency? We present a method for directly integrating an LLM into the
interpretation function of the formal semantics for a paraconsistent logic. We
provide experimental evidence for the feasibility of the method by evaluating
the function using datasets created from several short-form factuality
benchmarks. Unlike prior work, our method offers a theoretical framework for
neuro-symbolic reasoning that leverages an LLM's knowledge while preserving the
underlying logic's soundness and completeness properties.

Abstract: Reasoning-capable language models achieve state-of-the-art performance in
diverse complex tasks by generating long, explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
traces. While recent works show that base models can acquire such reasoning
traces via reinforcement learning or distillation from stronger models like
DeepSeek-R1, previous works demonstrate that even short CoT prompting without
fine-tuning is able to improve reasoning. We ask whether long CoT can be
induced in a base model using only prompting or minimal tuning. Using just 20
long CoT examples from the reasoning model \texttt{QwQ-32B-Preview}, we lightly
fine-tune the base model \texttt{Qwen2.5-32B}. The resulting model outperforms
the much larger \texttt{Qwen2.5-Math-72B-Instruct}, showing that a handful of
high-quality examples can unlock strong reasoning capabilities. We further
explore using CoT data from non-reasoning models and human annotators, enhanced
with prompt engineering, multi-pass editing, and structural guidance. However,
neither matches the performance of reasoning model traces, suggesting that
certain latent qualities of expert CoT are difficult to replicate. We analyze
key properties of reasoning data, such as problem difficulty, diversity, and
answer length, that influence reasoning distillation. While challenges remain,
we are optimistic that carefully curated human-written CoT, even in small
quantities, can activate reasoning behaviors in base models. We release our
human-authored dataset across refinement stages and invite further
investigation into what makes small-scale reasoning supervision so effective.

Abstract: Neurosymbolic artificial intelligence (AI) systems combine neural network and
classical symbolic AI mechanisms to exploit the complementary strengths of
large scale, generalizable learning and robust, verifiable reasoning. Numerous
classifications of neurosymbolic AI illustrate how these two components can be
integrated in distinctly different ways. In this work, we propose
reinterpreting instruction tuned large language models as model grounded
symbolic AI systems where natural language serves as the symbolic layer and
grounding is achieved through the models internal representation space. Within
this framework, we investigate and develop novel learning and reasoning
approaches that preserve structural similarities to traditional learning and
reasoning paradigms. Preliminary evaluations across axiomatic deductive
reasoning procedures of varying complexity provide insights into the
effectiveness of our approach in improving learning efficiency and reasoning
reliability.

TL;DR: 论文提出VerifyBench，一个跨领域基准测试，用于系统评估验证器性能，发现专用验证器与通用LLM在精度和召回率上的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证模型生成答案与参考答案的一致性是一个关键挑战，现有验证器缺乏灵活性和一致性，且缺乏系统评估。

Method: 构建包含4000个专家级问题的VerifyBench，涵盖数学、物理、化学和生物，设计四维实验框架评估验证器性能。

Result: 专用验证器精度高但召回率低，通用模型包容性强但精度不稳定，验证器对输入结构敏感且跨领域泛化能力有限。

Conclusion: 验证器技术存在瓶颈，需进一步优化以提升可靠性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on reinforcement learning (RL)
to enhance their reasoning capabilities through feedback. A critical challenge
is verifying the consistency of model-generated responses and reference
answers, since these responses are often lengthy, diverse, and nuanced.
Rule-based verifiers struggle with complexity, prompting the use of model-based
verifiers. However, specialized verifiers lack flexibility, while general LLM
judges can be inconsistent. Existing research primarily focuses on building
better verifiers, yet a systematic evaluation of different types of verifiers'
performance across domains remains lacking, severely constraining the reliable
development of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR). To address
this, we propose VerifyBench--a cross-domain comprehensive benchmark for
systematically evaluating verifiers. We construct 4,000 expert-level questions
covering mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology. Each question is
equipped with reference answers and diverse responses. The reliability of the
evaluation is ensured through a rigorous annotation process conducted by a
multidisciplinary expert team. We design a four-dimensional experimental
framework to comprehensively compare the performance boundaries of specialized
verifiers and general LLMs under combined conditions of extracted answers vs.
complete responses, and short vs. long outputs. Our evaluation uncovers
fundamental trade-offs in verifiers: while specialized verifiers achieve
leading accuracy, they exhibit deficiencies in recall; general models show
stronger inclusivity but unstable precision. More importantly, we discover
verifiers' high sensitivity to input structure and inherent limitations in
cross-domain generalization, providing critical insights into the bottlenecks
of current verifier technology.

Motivation: 异构多智能体强化学习中，单调改进与部分参数共享之间存在冲突，直接结合会导致策略更新基线漂移问题。

Method: 提出OMDPG算法，包括最优边际Q函数、广义Q批评器和集中式批评器分组执行器架构。

Result: 在SMAC和MAMuJoCo环境中，OMDPG优于多种先进的多智能体强化学习基线。

Conclusion: OMDPG成功解决了单调改进与部分参数共享的冲突，显著提升了异构多智能体强化学习的性能。

Abstract: In heterogeneous multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), achieving
monotonic improvement plays a pivotal role in enhancing performance. The HAPPO
algorithm proposes a feasible solution by introducing a sequential update
scheme, which requires independent learning with No Parameter-sharing (NoPS).
However, heterogeneous MARL generally requires Partial Parameter-sharing
(ParPS) based on agent grouping to achieve high cooperative performance. Our
experiments prove that directly combining ParPS with the sequential update
scheme leads to the policy updating baseline drift problem, thereby failing to
achieve improvement. To solve the conflict between monotonic improvement and
ParPS, we propose the Optimal Marginal Deterministic Policy Gradient (OMDPG)
algorithm. First, we replace the sequentially computed $Q_{\psi}^s(s,a_{1:i})$
with the Optimal Marginal Q (OMQ) function $\phi_{\psi}^*(s,a_{1:i})$ derived
from Q-functions. This maintains MAAD's monotonic improvement while eliminating
the conflict through optimal joint action sequences instead of sequential
policy ratio calculations. Second, we introduce the Generalized Q Critic (GQC)
as the critic function, employing pessimistic uncertainty-constrained loss to
optimize different Q-value estimations. This provides the required Q-values for
OMQ computation and stable baselines for actor updates. Finally, we implement a
Centralized Critic Grouped Actor (CCGA) architecture that simultaneously
achieves ParPS in local policy networks and accurate global Q-function
computation. Experimental results in SMAC and MAMuJoCo environments demonstrate
that OMDPG outperforms various state-of-the-art MARL baselines.

Motivation: 解决科学和技术领域对意图实际意义的忽视，提供一种无需复杂训练或推理的低成本意图分析方法。

Method: 利用Promise Theory的语义时空模型，通过多尺度异常检测和时空一致性分离意图内容和环境背景。

Result: 提出了一种低成本、高效的潜在意图评估方法，适用于基础生物体。

Conclusion: 该方法为意图分析提供了实用且低成本的解决方案，但概念形成能力受限于代理的记忆容量。

Abstract: Since Searle's work deconstructing intent and intentionality in the realm of
philosophy, the practical meaning of intent has received little attention in
science and technology. Intentionality and context are both central to the
scope of Promise Theory's model of Semantic Spacetime, used as an effective
Tiny Language Model. One can identify themes and concepts from a text, on a low
level (without knowledge of the specific language) by using process coherence
as a guide. Any agent process can assess superficially a degree of latent
`intentionality' in data by looking for anomalous multi-scale anomalies and
assessing the work done to form them. Scale separation can be used to sort
parts into `intended' content and `ambient context', using the spacetime
coherence as a measure. This offers an elementary but pragmatic interpretation
of latent intentionality for very low computational cost, and without reference
to extensive training or reasoning capabilities. The process is well within the
reach of basic organisms as it does not require large scale artificial
probabilistic batch processing. The level of concept formation depends,
however, on the memory capacity of the agent.

Conclusion: 该方法为提升CoT推理的可靠性提供了新路径，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning has demonstrated remarkable deep reasoning
capabilities in both large language models (LLMs) and multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). However, its reliability is often undermined by the
accumulation of errors in intermediate steps. This paper introduces an novel
approach to calibrate the CoT reasoning accuracy by leveraging the model's
intrinsic veracity encoding. We discover that specific attention head
activations reliably reflect the truthfulness of reasoning steps in CoT. Based
on this insight, we train a confidence predictor to evaluate the correctness of
each reasoning step using these truthfulness-sensitive activations, dynamically
selecting the most plausible reasoning path via beam search. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art baselines (e.g., Few-Shot CoT, Self-Consistency, and
Self-Evaluation Guided Beam Search) across the mathematical, symbolic, and
commonsense reasoning tasks, exhibiting superior accuracy and reliability in
both unimodal and multimodal settings. We further validate the approach on
large reasoning models, confirming its applicability to specialized reasoning
models. Additionally, we explore the role of the model's self-correction
ability in CoT reasoning. This work provides a novel reliability improvement
path for CoT reasoning with broad application potential.

Motivation: 解决知识图谱（KG）互操作性研究中SPARQL翻译的空白。

Method: 使用三种LLM模型（Llama-3-8B、DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B、Mistral-Large-Instruct-2407），采用零样本、少样本和思维链变体进行测试。

Result: Wikidata到DBpedia的翻译效果优于反向翻译，模型性能差异显著。

Abstract: This paper investigates whether state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs)
can automatically translate SPARQL between popular Knowledge Graph (KG)
schemas. We focus on translations between the DBpedia and Wikidata KG, and
later on DBLP and OpenAlex KG. This study addresses a notable gap in KG
interoperability research by rigorously evaluating LLM performance on
SPARQL-to-SPARQL translation. Two benchmarks are assembled, where the first
align 100 DBpedia-Wikidata queries from QALD-9-Plus; the second contains 100
DBLP queries aligned to OpenAlex, testing generalizability beyond encyclopaedic
KGs. Three open LLMs: Llama-3-8B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B, and
Mistral-Large-Instruct-2407 are selected based on their sizes and architectures
and tested with zero-shot, few-shot, and two chain-of-thought variants. Outputs
were compared with gold answers, and resulting errors were categorized. We find
that the performance varies markedly across models and prompting strategies,
and that translations for Wikidata to DBpedia work far better than translations
for DBpedia to Wikidata.

Motivation: 渐进语义在计算论证中是一种细粒度的替代方案，但在假设基础论证（ABA）中尚未得到充分研究，尽管ABA是一种流行的结构化论证形式。

Method: 通过将双极集基础论证框架作为ABA框架的抽象，并推广最先进的模块化渐进语义（QBAFs），提出了一种渐进ABA语义。

Result: 实验表明，渐进ABA语义满足平衡性和单调性等理想性质，并通过合成ABA框架验证了其与基于论证方法的对比和收敛性。

Conclusion: 本文填补了渐进语义在ABA中的研究空白，并提出了一种有效的渐进语义家族，为ABA框架提供了新的分析工具。

Abstract: In computational argumentation, gradual semantics are fine-grained
alternatives to extension-based and labelling-based semantics . They ascribe a
dialectical strength to (components of) arguments sanctioning their degree of
acceptability. Several gradual semantics have been studied for abstract,
bipolar and quantitative bipolar argumentation frameworks (QBAFs), as well as,
to a lesser extent, for some forms of structured argumentation. However, this
has not been the case for assumption-based argumentation (ABA), despite it
being a popular form of structured argumentation with several applications
where gradual semantics could be useful. In this paper, we fill this gap and
propose a family of novel gradual semantics for equipping assumptions, which
are the core components in ABA frameworks, with dialectical strengths. To do
so, we use bipolar set-based argumentation frameworks as an abstraction of
(potentially non-flat) ABA frameworks and generalise state-of-the-art modular
gradual semantics for QBAFs. We show that our gradual ABA semantics satisfy
suitable adaptations of desirable properties of gradual QBAF semantics, such as
balance and monotonicity. We also explore an argument-based approach that
leverages established QBAF modular semantics directly, and use it as baseline.
Finally, we conduct experiments with synthetic ABA frameworks to compare our
gradual ABA semantics with its argument-based counterpart and assess
convergence.

Abstract: As AI systems become increasingly capable and ubiquitous, ensuring the safety

paper introduces BlueGlass, a framework designed to facilitate composite AI
safety workflows by providing a unified infrastructure enabling the integration
and composition of diverse safety tools that operate across model internals and
outputs. Furthermore, to demonstrate the utility of this framework, we present
three safety-oriented analyses on vision-language models for the task of object
detection: (1) distributional evaluation, revealing performance trade-offs and
potential failure modes across distributions; (2) probe-based analysis of layer
dynamics highlighting shared hierarchical learning via phase transition; and
(3) sparse autoencoders identifying interpretable concepts. More broadly, this
work contributes foundational infrastructure and findings for building more
robust and reliable AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLM仍在发展中，当前的偏见可能随时间变化，因此需要通用的去偏见策略。人类决策中的去偏见方法为此提供了灵感。

Method: 采用人类决策文献中的元认知提示（如“你可能是错的吗？”）来引导LLM反思其回答，揭示潜在偏见和矛盾。

Result: 元认知提示能有效引导LLM生成额外信息，包括错误、偏见和替代观点，这些在初始回答中未体现。

Conclusion: 人类心理学为提示工程提供了新思路，可借鉴其长期有效的决策改进方法用于LLM。

Abstract: Identifying bias in LLMs is ongoing. Because they are still in development,
what is true today may be false tomorrow. We therefore need general strategies
for debiasing that will outlive current models. Strategies developed for
debiasing human decision making offer one promising approach as they
incorporate an LLM-style prompt intervention designed to bring latent knowledge
into awareness during decision making. LLMs trained on vast amounts of
information contain information about potential biases, counter-arguments, and
contradictory evidence, but that information may only be brought to bear if
prompted. Metacognitive prompts developed in the human decision making
literature are designed to achieve this, and as I demonstrate here, they show
promise with LLMs. The prompt I focus on here is "could you be wrong?"
Following an LLM response, this prompt leads LLMs to produce additional
information, including why they answered as they did, errors, biases,
contradictory evidence, and alternatives, none of which were apparent in their
initial response. Indeed, this metaknowledge often reveals that how LLMs and
users interpret prompts are not aligned. Here I demonstrate this prompt using a
set of questions taken from recent articles about LLM biases, including
implicit discriminatory biases and failures of metacognition. "Could you be
wrong" prompts the LLM to identify its own biases and produce cogent
metacognitive reflection. I also present another example involving convincing
but incomplete information, which is readily corrected by the metacognitive
prompt. In sum, this work argues that human psychology offers a new avenue for
prompt engineering, leveraging a long history of effective prompt-based
improvements to human decision making.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机在野火监测中至关重要，但现有深度强化学习方法（DRL）存在采样效率低、仿真与现实的差距以及复杂训练等问题，不适用于时间敏感任务。

Method: 采用基于LLM的上下文学习（FRSICL），通过自然语言任务描述和环境反馈动态生成数据收集计划和速度控制，无需大量重新训练。

Result: 仿真结果表明，FRSICL在最小化平均AoI方面优于PPO和最近邻基线方法。

Conclusion: FRSICL为无人机野火监测提供了一种高效、动态的解决方案，克服了DRL的局限性。

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are vital for public safety, particularly in
wildfire monitoring, where early detection minimizes environmental impact. In
UAV-Assisted Wildfire Monitoring (UAWM) systems, joint optimization of sensor
transmission scheduling and velocity is critical for minimizing Age of
Information (AoI) from stale sensor data. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has
been used for such optimization; however, its limitations such as low sampling
efficiency, simulation-to-reality gaps, and complex training render it
unsuitable for time-critical applications like wildfire monitoring. This paper
introduces a new online Flight Resource Allocation scheme based on LLM-Enabled
In-Context Learning (FRSICL) to jointly optimize the UAV's flight control and
data collection schedule along the trajectory in real time, thereby
asymptotically minimizing the average AoI across ground sensors. In contrast to
DRL, FRSICL generates data collection schedules and controls velocity using
natural language task descriptions and feedback from the environment, enabling
dynamic decision-making without extensive retraining. Simulation results
confirm the effectiveness of the proposed FRSICL compared to Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) and Nearest-Neighbor baselines.

Result: 通过适应性视角，支持对MARL性能的更原则性评估，超越狭窄定义的基准。

Conclusion: 该框架有助于开发更适合动态现实多智能体系统的算法。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has shown clear effectiveness in
coordinating multiple agents across simulated benchmarks and constrained
scenarios. However, its deployment in real-world multi-agent systems (MAS)
remains limited, primarily due to the complex and dynamic nature of such
environments. These challenges arise from multiple interacting sources of
variability, including fluctuating agent populations, evolving task goals, and
inconsistent execution conditions. Together, these factors demand that MARL
algorithms remain effective under continuously changing system configurations
and operational demands. To better capture and assess this capacity for
adjustment, we introduce the concept of \textit{adaptability} as a unified and
practically grounded lens through which to evaluate the reliability of MARL
algorithms under shifting conditions, broadly referring to any changes in the
environment dynamics that may occur during learning or execution. Centred on
the notion of adaptability, we propose a structured framework comprising three
key dimensions: learning adaptability, policy adaptability, and scenario-driven
adaptability. By adopting this adaptability perspective, we aim to support more
principled assessments of MARL performance beyond narrowly defined benchmarks.
Ultimately, this survey contributes to the development of algorithms that are
better suited for deployment in dynamic, real-world multi-agent systems.

Motivation: 现有自动饮食评估系统忽视非视觉因素（如食材替代和个人饮食需求），瑞士缺乏统一的营养信息库。

Method: 构建SwissFKG，采用LLM增强图谱内容，并评估四种LLM的性能。

Result: LLM能有效补充营养信息，SwissFKG提供食材级信息和营养指南对齐。

Conclusion: SwissFKG为结合视觉、上下文和文化维度的下一代饮食评估工具奠定了基础。

Abstract: AI has driven significant progress in the nutrition field, especially through
multimedia-based automatic dietary assessment. However, existing automatic
dietary assessment systems often overlook critical non-visual factors, such as
recipe-specific ingredient substitutions that can significantly alter
nutritional content, and rarely account for individual dietary needs, including
allergies, restrictions, cultural practices, and personal preferences. In
Switzerland, while food-related information is available, it remains
fragmented, and no centralized repository currently integrates all relevant
nutrition-related aspects within a Swiss context. To bridge this divide, we
introduce the Swiss Food Knowledge Graph (SwissFKG), the first resource, to our
best knowledge, to unite recipes, ingredients, and their substitutions with
nutrient data, dietary restrictions, allergen information, and national
nutrition guidelines under one graph. We establish a LLM-powered enrichment
pipeline for populating the graph, whereby we further present the first
benchmark of four off-the-shelf (<70 B parameter) LLMs for food knowledge
augmentation. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can effectively enrich the
graph with relevant nutritional information. Our SwissFKG goes beyond recipe
recommendations by offering ingredient-level information such as allergen and
dietary restriction information, and guidance aligned with nutritional
guidelines. Moreover, we implement a Graph-RAG application to showcase how the
SwissFKG's rich natural-language data structure can help LLM answer
user-specific nutrition queries, and we evaluate LLM-embedding pairings by
comparing user-query responses against predefined expected answers. As such,
our work lays the foundation for the next generation of dietary assessment

### [268] [Should We Ever Prefer Decision Transformer for Offline Reinforcement Learning?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10174)
*Yumi Omori,Zixuan Dong,Keith Ross*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文比较了Decision Transformer (DT)与Filtered Behavior Cloning (FBC)在稀疏奖励环境中的表现，发现FBC更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨DT在离线强化学习中的适用性，尤其是在稀疏奖励环境中是否优于传统方法。

Method: 在Robomimic和D4RL任务上实验，比较DT与FBC的性能。FBC通过过滤低质量轨迹后进行行为克隆。

Result: FBC在稀疏奖励环境中表现优于DT，且更高效。

Conclusion: DT在稀疏和密集奖励环境中均不占优，质疑其适用性。

Abstract: In recent years, extensive work has explored the application of the
Transformer architecture to reinforcement learning problems. Among these,
Decision Transformer (DT) has gained particular attention in the context of
offline reinforcement learning due to its ability to frame return-conditioned
policy learning as a sequence modeling task. Most recently, Bhargava et al.
(2024) provided a systematic comparison of DT with more conventional MLP-based
offline RL algorithms, including Behavior Cloning (BC) and Conservative
Q-Learning (CQL), and claimed that DT exhibits superior performance in
sparse-reward and low-quality data settings.
  In this paper, through experimentation on robotic manipulation tasks
(Robomimic) and locomotion benchmarks (D4RL), we show that MLP-based Filtered
Behavior Cloning (FBC) achieves competitive or superior performance compared to
DT in sparse-reward environments. FBC simply filters out low-performing
trajectories from the dataset and then performs ordinary behavior cloning on
the filtered dataset. FBC is not only very straightforward, but it also
requires less training data and is computationally more efficient. The results
therefore suggest that DT is not preferable for sparse-reward environments.
From prior work, arguably, DT is also not preferable for dense-reward
environments. Thus, we pose the question: Is DT ever preferable?

### [269] [Survey for Categorising Explainable AI Studies Using Data Analysis Task Frameworks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10208)
*Hamzah Ziadeh,Hendrik Knoche*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于“什么、为什么、谁”三个维度分类和比较可解释人工智能（XAI）研究的方法，旨在解决任务描述不足、脱离上下文研究及目标用户测试不足等问题。

Motivation: 当前XAI研究存在大量矛盾且缺乏具体设计建议，主要源于对需要AI辅助的任务理解不足。

Method: 借鉴视觉分析、认知科学和仪表板设计等领域，提出分类和比较XAI研究的三维框架（什么、为什么、谁），并提出研究指南。

Result: 发现主要问题为任务描述不足、脱离上下文研究和目标用户测试不足，建议研究应明确报告用户的领域、AI及数据分析专长。

Conclusion: 提出的框架和指南有助于研究者更好地识别相关研究、发现研究空白并处理XAI设计中的矛盾结果。

Abstract: Research into explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) for data analysis
tasks suffer from a large number of contradictions and lack of concrete design
recommendations stemming from gaps in understanding the tasks that require AI
assistance. In this paper, we drew on multiple fields such as visual analytics,
cognition, and dashboard design to propose a method for categorising and
comparing XAI studies under three dimensions: what, why, and who. We identified
the main problems as: inadequate descriptions of tasks, context-free studies,
and insufficient testing with target users. We propose that studies should
specifically report on their users' domain, AI, and data analysis expertise to
illustrate the generalisability of their findings. We also propose study
guidelines for designing and reporting XAI tasks to improve the XAI community's
ability to parse the rapidly growing field. We hope that our contribution can
help researchers and designers better identify which studies are most relevant
to their work, what gaps exist in the research, and how to handle contradictory
results regarding XAI design.

Abstract: Tables are fundamental in domains such as finance, healthcare, and public
administration, yet real-world table tasks often involve noise, structural
heterogeneity, and semantic complexity--issues underexplored in existing
research that primarily targets clean academic datasets. This survey focuses on
LLM-based Table Agents, which aim to automate table-centric workflows by
integrating preprocessing, reasoning, and domain adaptation. We define five
core competencies--C1: Table Structure Understanding, C2: Table and Query
Semantic Understanding, C3: Table Retrieval and Compression, C4: Executable
Reasoning with Traceability, and C5: Cross-Domain Generalization--to analyze
and compare current approaches. In addition, a detailed examination of the
Text-to-SQL Agent reveals a performance gap between academic benchmarks and
real-world scenarios, especially for open-source models. Finally, we provide
actionable insights to improve the robustness, generalization, and efficiency
of LLM-based Table Agents in practical settings.

Abstract: This paper seeks to advance CVRP research by addressing the challenge of
understanding the nuanced relationships between instance characteristics and
metaheuristic (MH) performance. We present Instance Space Analysis (ISA) as a
valuable tool that allows for a new perspective on the field. By combining the
ISA methodology with a dataset from the DIMACS 12th Implementation Challenge on
Vehicle Routing, our research enabled the identification of 23 relevant
instance characteristics. Our use of the PRELIM, SIFTED, and PILOT stages,
which employ dimensionality reduction and machine learning methods, allowed us
to create a two-dimensional projection of the instance space to understand how
the structure of instances affect the behavior of MHs. A key contribution of
our work is that we provide a projection matrix, which makes it straightforward
to incorporate new instances into this analysis and allows for a new method for
instance analysis in the CVRP field.

Abstract: School dropout is a serious problem in distance learning, where early
detection is crucial for effective intervention and student perseverance.
Predicting student dropout using available educational data is a widely
researched topic in learning analytics. Our partner's distance learning
platform highlights the importance of integrating diverse data sources,
including socio-demographic data, behavioral data, and sentiment analysis, to
accurately predict dropout risks. In this paper, we introduce a novel model
that combines sentiment analysis of student comments using the Bidirectional
Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model with socio-demographic
and behavioral data analyzed through Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). We
fine-tuned BERT on student comments to capture nuanced sentiments, which were
then merged with key features selected using feature importance techniques in
XGBoost. Our model was tested on unseen data from the next academic year,
achieving an accuracy of 84\%, compared to 82\% for the baseline model.
Additionally, the model demonstrated superior performance in other metrics,
such as precision and F1-score. The proposed method could be a vital tool in
developing personalized strategies to reduce dropout rates and encourage
student perseverance

Abstract: The ability to transfer knowledge from prior experiences to novel tasks
stands as a pivotal capability of intelligent agents, including both humans and
computational models. This principle forms the basis of transfer learning,
where large pre-trained neural networks are fine-tuned to adapt to downstream
tasks. Transfer learning has demonstrated tremendous success, both in terms of
task adaptation speed and performance. However there are several domains where,
due to lack of data, training such large pre-trained models or foundational
models is not a possibility - computational chemistry, computational
immunology, and medical imaging are examples. To address these challenges, our
work focuses on designing architectures to enable efficient acquisition of
priors when large amounts of data are unavailable. In particular, we
demonstrate that we can use neural memory to enable adaptation on
non-stationary distributions with only a few samples. Then we demonstrate that
our hypernetwork designs (a network that generates another network) can acquire
more generalizable priors than standard networks when trained with Model
Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML). Subsequently, we apply hypernetworks to 3D scene
generation, demonstrating that they can acquire priors efficiently on just a
handful of training scenes, thereby leading to faster text-to-3D generation. We
then extend our hypernetwork framework to perform 3D segmentation on novel
scenes with limited data by efficiently transferring priors from earlier viewed
scenes. Finally, we repurpose an existing molecular generative method as a
pre-training framework that facilitates improved molecular property prediction,
addressing critical challenges in computational immunology
