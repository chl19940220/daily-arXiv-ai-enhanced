### [1] [Mechanistic Interpretability of Diffusion Models: Circuit-Level Analysis and Causal Validation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17237)
*Dip Roy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文通过定量电路分析揭示了扩散模型在图像生成中的计算路径和机制原理，发现合成与自然数据分布的处理存在算法差异，并识别了八种功能不同的注意力机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究扩散模型在图像生成中的计算机制，以理解其行为并为算法控制提供基础。

Method: 通过系统性干预实验，分析了2,000张合成图像和2,000张CelebA面部图像，测量计算复杂性和注意力模式。

Result: 发现真实面部处理需要更高计算复杂度（1.084±0.008），识别了八种功能不同的注意力机制，干预实验显示性能下降25.6%至128.3%。

Conclusion: 研究为生成模型行为的算法理解和控制提供了定量基础，支持通过机制干预策略优化模型。

Abstract: We present a quantitative circuit-level analysis of diffusion models,
establishing computational pathways and mechanistic principles underlying image
generation processes. Through systematic intervention experiments across 2,000
synthetic and 2,000 CelebA facial images, we discover fundamental algorithmic
differences in how diffusion architectures process synthetic versus
naturalistic data distributions. Our investigation reveals that real-world face
processing requires circuits with measurably higher computational complexity
(complexity ratio = 1.084 plus/minus 0.008, p < 0.001), exhibiting distinct
attention specialization patterns with entropy divergence ranging from 0.015 to
0.166 across denoising timesteps. We identify eight functionally distinct
attention mechanisms showing specialized computational roles: edge detection
(entropy = 3.18 plus/minus 0.12), texture analysis (entropy = 4.16 plus/minus
0.08), and semantic understanding (entropy = 2.67 plus/minus 0.15).
Intervention analysis demonstrates critical computational bottlenecks where
targeted ablations produce 25.6% to 128.3% performance degradation, providing
causal evidence for identified circuit functions. These findings establish
quantitative foundations for algorithmic understanding and control of
generative model behavior through mechanistic intervention strategies.

### [2] [SRKD: Towards Efficient 3D Point Cloud Segmentation via Structure- and Relation-aware Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17290)
*Yuqi Li,Junhao Dong,Zeyu Dong,Chuanguang Yang,Zhulin An,Yongjun Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SRKD的结构和关系感知知识蒸馏框架，用于将大型教师模型的知识转移到轻量级学生模型中，以解决3D点云分割的计算复杂性和部署限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D点云分割中大规模基于transformer模型的计算复杂性和部署限制问题。

Method: 通过亲和矩阵关系对齐模块和跨样本小批量构建策略，从教师模型蒸馏几何和语义知识到学生模型，并使用KL散度对齐语义分布。

Result: 在显著降低模型复杂性的同时，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: SRKD框架在现实部署场景中表现出高效性和有效性。

Abstract: 3D point cloud segmentation faces practical challenges due to the
computational complexity and deployment limitations of large-scale
transformer-based models. To address this, we propose a novel Structure- and
Relation-aware Knowledge Distillation framework, named SRKD, that transfers
rich geometric and semantic knowledge from a large frozen teacher model (>100M)
to a lightweight student model (<15M). Specifically, we propose an affinity
matrix-based relation alignment module, which distills structural dependencies
from the teacher to the student through point-wise similarity matching,
enhancing the student's capability to learn contextual interactions. Meanwhile,
we introduce a cross-sample mini-batch construction strategy that enables the
student to perceive stable and generalized geometric structure. This aligns
across diverse point cloud instances of the teacher, rather than within a
single sample. Additionally, KL divergence is applied to align semantic
distributions, and ground-truth supervision further reinforces accurate
segmentation. Our method achieves state of the art performance with
significantly reduced model complexity, demonstrating its effectiveness and
efficiency in real-world deployment scenarios. Our Code is available at
https://github.com/itsnotacie/SRKD.

TL;DR: MISO是一种基于视觉的机器学习模型，用于生成阿拉斯加高分辨率土壤地图，优于传统随机森林方法，适用于永久冻土监测和生态保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉斯加土壤测绘对生态保护和基础设施稳定至关重要，但传统方法效率低，需更高效的技术应对气候变化导致的永久冻土融化。

Method: MISO结合地理空间基础模型、隐式神经表示和对比学习，实现连续空间预测和多模态对齐。

Result: MISO在空间交叉验证中表现优于随机森林，泛化能力更强，召回率更高。

Conclusion: MISO展示了先进机器学习在土壤测绘中的潜力，为永久冻土区域的未来规划和采样提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Fine-scale soil mapping in Alaska, traditionally relying on fieldwork and
localized simulations, remains a critical yet underdeveloped task, despite the
region's ecological importance and extensive permafrost coverage. As permafrost
thaw accelerates due to climate change, it threatens infrastructure stability
and key ecosystem services, such as soil carbon storage. High-resolution soil
maps are essential for characterizing permafrost distribution, identifying
vulnerable areas, and informing adaptation strategies. We present MISO, a
vision-based machine learning (ML) model to produce statewide fine-scale soil
maps for near-surface permafrost and soil taxonomy. The model integrates a
geospatial foundation model for visual feature extraction, implicit neural
representations for continuous spatial prediction, and contrastive learning for
multimodal alignment and geo-location awareness. We compare MISO with Random
Forest (RF), a traditional ML model that has been widely used in soil mapping
applications. Spatial cross-validation and regional analysis across Permafrost
Zones and Major Land Resource Areas (MLRAs) show that MISO generalizes better
to remote, unseen locations and achieves higher recall than RF, which is
critical for monitoring permafrost thaw and related environmental processes.
These findings demonstrate the potential of advanced ML approaches for
fine-scale soil mapping and provide practical guidance for future soil sampling
and infrastructure planning in permafrost-affected landscapes. The project will
be released at https://github.com/knowledge-computing/Peatland-permafrost.

### [4] [RadarSeq: A Temporal Vision Framework for User Churn Prediction via Radar Chart Sequences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17325)
*Sina Najafi,M. Hadi Sepanj,Fahimeh Jafari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于时间感知的计算机视觉框架，用于预测非订阅制零工平台的用户流失，通过雷达图序列建模用户行为，结合CNN和双向LSTM提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非订阅制零工平台的用户流失预测因缺乏明确标签和动态行为而具有挑战性，现有方法难以捕捉关键时间线索。

Method: 将用户行为模式建模为雷达图序列，结合预训练CNN编码器和双向LSTM，捕捉时空模式。

Result: 在真实数据集上表现优于经典模型和ViT基线，F1分数提升17.7，精确度提升29.4，AUC提升16.1，并提高了可解释性。

Conclusion: 该框架的模块化设计、可解释性工具和高效部署特性使其适用于动态零工经济平台的大规模流失建模。

Abstract: Predicting user churn in non-subscription gig platforms, where disengagement
is implicit, poses unique challenges due to the absence of explicit labels and
the dynamic nature of user behavior. Existing methods often rely on aggregated
snapshots or static visual representations, which obscure temporal cues
critical for early detection. In this work, we propose a temporally-aware
computer vision framework that models user behavioral patterns as a sequence of
radar chart images, each encoding day-level behavioral features. By integrating
a pretrained CNN encoder with a bidirectional LSTM, our architecture captures
both spatial and temporal patterns underlying churn behavior. Extensive
experiments on a large real-world dataset demonstrate that our method
outperforms classical models and ViT-based radar chart baselines, yielding
gains of 17.7 in F1 score, 29.4 in precision, and 16.1 in AUC, along with
improved interpretability. The framework's modular design, explainability
tools, and efficient deployment characteristics make it suitable for
large-scale churn modeling in dynamic gig-economy platforms.

### [5] [P2MFDS: A Privacy-Preserving Multimodal Fall Detection System for Elderly People in Bathroom Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17332)
*Haitian Wang,Yiren Wang,Xinyu Wang,Yumeng Miao,Yuliang Zhang,Yu Zhang,Atif Mansoor*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种隐私保护的多模态跌倒检测系统P2MFDS，结合毫米波雷达和3D振动传感，显著提高了复杂浴室环境中的检测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 老龄化加剧导致跌倒风险增加，浴室是跌倒高发区，现有单模态系统在复杂环境中准确性不足。

Method: 开发传感器评估框架，融合毫米波雷达和3D振动传感，构建双流网络P2MFDS，结合CNN-BiLSTM-Attention和多尺度CNN-SEBlock-Self-Attention分支。

Result: P2MFDS在准确率和召回率上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 多模态融合方法有效解决了单模态系统的局限性，为浴室环境中的隐私保护跌倒检测提供了可行方案。

Abstract: By 2050, people aged 65 and over are projected to make up 16 percent of the
global population. As aging is closely associated with increased fall risk,
particularly in wet and confined environments such as bathrooms where over 80
percent of falls occur. Although recent research has increasingly focused on
non-intrusive, privacy-preserving approaches that do not rely on wearable
devices or video-based monitoring, these efforts have not fully overcome the
limitations of existing unimodal systems (e.g., WiFi-, infrared-, or
mmWave-based), which are prone to reduced accuracy in complex environments.
These limitations stem from fundamental constraints in unimodal sensing,
including system bias and environmental interference, such as multipath fading
in WiFi-based systems and drastic temperature changes in infrared-based
methods. To address these challenges, we propose a Privacy-Preserving
Multimodal Fall Detection System for Elderly People in Bathroom Environments.
First, we develop a sensor evaluation framework to select and fuse
millimeter-wave radar with 3D vibration sensing, and use it to construct and
preprocess a large-scale, privacy-preserving multimodal dataset in real
bathroom settings, which will be released upon publication. Second, we
introduce P2MFDS, a dual-stream network combining a CNN-BiLSTM-Attention branch
for radar motion dynamics with a multi-scale CNN-SEBlock-Self-Attention branch
for vibration impact detection. By uniting macro- and micro-scale features,
P2MFDS delivers significant gains in accuracy and recall over state-of-the-art
approaches. Code and pretrained models will be made available at:
https://github.com/HaitianWang/P2MFDS-A-Privacy-Preserving-Multimodal-Fall-Detection-Network-for-Elderly-Individuals-in-Bathroom.

### [6] [A Novel Multi-layer Task-centric and Data Quality Framework for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17346)
*Yuhan Zhou,Haihua Chen,Kewei Sha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种以任务为中心、数据质量为基础的五层框架，旨在将数据质量与任务需求和性能目标映射，并通过案例研究证明了冗余处理对任务性能的提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶领域的研究和实践过于关注模型和算法，而忽视了数据质量的重要性，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出一个五层框架（数据层、DQ层、任务层、应用层和目标层），并通过nuScenes数据集上的案例研究验证冗余处理的效果。

Result: 部分去除多源图像数据的冗余可以提高YOLOv8目标检测任务的性能，同时揭示了多模态数据中的冗余问题。

Conclusion: 本文为自动驾驶领域的数据质量、任务编排和性能导向系统开发提供了新思路，有望推动更智能、适应性更强的自动驾驶系统发展。

Abstract: The next-generation autonomous vehicles (AVs), embedded with frequent
real-time decision-making, will rely heavily on a large volume of multisource
and multimodal data. In real-world settings, the data quality (DQ) of different
sources and modalities usually varies due to unexpected environmental factors
or sensor issues. However, both researchers and practitioners in the AV field
overwhelmingly concentrate on models/algorithms while undervaluing the DQ. To
fulfill the needs of the next-generation AVs with guarantees of functionality,
efficiency, and trustworthiness, this paper proposes a novel task-centric and
data quality vase framework which consists of five layers: data layer, DQ
layer, task layer, application layer, and goal layer. The proposed framework
aims to map DQ with task requirements and performance goals. To illustrate, a
case study investigating redundancy on the nuScenes dataset proves that
partially removing redundancy on multisource image data could improve YOLOv8
object detection task performance. Analysis on multimodal data of image and
LiDAR further presents existing redundancy DQ issues. This paper opens up a
range of critical but unexplored challenges at the intersection of DQ, task
orchestration, and performance-oriented system development in AVs. It is
expected to guide the AV community toward building more adaptive, explainable,
and resilient AVs that respond intelligently to dynamic environments and
heterogeneous data streams. Code, data, and implementation details are publicly
available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/dq4av-framework/README.md.

### [7] [Efficient Feedback Gate Network for Hyperspectral Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17361)
*Xufei Wang,Mingjian Zhang,Fei Ge,Jinchen Zhu,Wen Sha,Jifen Ren,Zhimeng Hou,Shouguo Zheng,ling Zheng,Shizhuang Weng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于分组的高效反馈门网络，用于单张高光谱图像超分辨率（SHSR），通过反馈和门操作提升空间分辨率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SHSR方法未能充分利用波段间和空间-光谱信息的连贯性，导致性能受限。

Method: 设计了高效反馈门网络，包括SPDFM模块（通道混洗和扩张卷积）和SSRGM模块（空间-光谱强化门），并通过三维SSRGM增强整体信息。

Result: 在三个高光谱数据集上验证了方法在光谱保真和空间内容重建方面的优越性。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了SHSR的性能，优于现有技术。

Abstract: Even without auxiliary images, single hyperspectral image super-resolution
(SHSR) methods can be designed to improve the spatial resolution of
hyperspectral images. However, failing to explore coherence thoroughly along
bands and spatial-spectral information leads to the limited performance of the
SHSR. In this study, we propose a novel group-based SHSR method termed the
efficient feedback gate network, which uses various feedbacks and gate
operations involving large kernel convolutions and spectral interactions. In
particular, by providing different guidance for neighboring groups, we can
learn rich band information and hierarchical hyperspectral spatial information
using channel shuffling and dilatation convolution in shuffled and progressive
dilated fusion module(SPDFM). Moreover, we develop a wide-bound perception gate
block and a spectrum enhancement gate block to construct the spatial-spectral
reinforcement gate module (SSRGM) and obtain highly representative
spatial-spectral features efficiently. Additionally, we apply a
three-dimensional SSRGM to enhance holistic information and coherence for
hyperspectral data. The experimental results on three hyperspectral datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed network over the
state-of-the-art methods in terms of spectral fidelity and spatial content
reconstruction.

### [8] [From Drawings to Decisions: A Hybrid Vision-Language Framework for Parsing 2D Engineering Drawings into Structured Manufacturing Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17374)
*Muhammad Tayyab Khan,Lequn Chen,Zane Yong,Jun Ming Tan,Wenhe Feng,Seung Ki Moon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合旋转感知目标检测模型和视觉语言解析器的混合框架，用于高效提取2D工程图中的关键信息，并在下游制造任务中展示实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动提取2D工程图中的关键信息效率低且不可靠，通用OCR模型因复杂布局和工程符号表现不佳，需改进。

Method: 使用YOLOv11-OBB定位注释并提取定向边界框（OBB）补丁，再通过微调的轻量级视觉语言模型（VLM）解析为结构化输出。

Result: Donut模型表现优于Florence-2，精确度为88.5%，召回率为99.2%，F1分数为93.5%，幻觉率为11.5%。

Conclusion: 该框架有效支持下游制造任务，提升了2D工程图解析的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Efficient and accurate extraction of key information from 2D engineering
drawings is essential for advancing digital manufacturing workflows. Such
information includes geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T), measures,
material specifications, and textual annotations. Manual extraction is slow and
labor-intensive, while generic OCR models often fail due to complex layouts,
engineering symbols, and rotated text, leading to incomplete and unreliable
outputs. These limitations result in incomplete and unreliable outputs. To
address these challenges, we propose a hybrid vision-language framework that
integrates a rotation-aware object detection model (YOLOv11-obb) with a
transformer-based vision-language parser. Our structured pipeline applies
YOLOv11-OBB to localize annotations and extract oriented bounding box (OBB)
patches, which are then parsed into structured outputs using a fine-tuned,
lightweight vision-language model (VLM). We curate a dataset of 1,367 2D
mechanical drawings annotated across nine key categories. YOLOv11-OBB is
trained on this dataset to detect OBBs and extract annotation patches. These
are parsed using two open-source VLMs: Donut and Florence-2. Both models are
lightweight and well-suited for specialized industrial tasks under limited
computational overhead. Following fine-tuning of both models on the curated
dataset of image patches paired with structured annotation labels, a
comparative experiment is conducted to evaluate parsing performance across four
key metrics. Donut outperforms Florence-2, achieving 88.5% precision, 99.2%
recall, and a 93.5% F1-score, with a hallucination rate of 11.5%. Finally, a
case study demonstrates how the extracted structured information supports
downstream manufacturing tasks such as process and tool selection, showcasing
the practical utility of the proposed framework in modernizing 2D drawing
interpretation.

*Zhiyi Shi,Junsik Kim,Helen Y. Yang,Yonghyun Song,Hyun-Jic Oh,Dalit Ben-Yosef,Daniel Needleman,Hanspeter Pfister*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为STPT的自监督学习方法，用于预测体外受精胚胎的存活率，解决了传统方法在长视频和时序对齐上的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于标记数据稀缺且传统自监督学习方法难以处理胚胎发育视频的长序列和时序不一致问题，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: STPT分为空间和时间两个阶段，分别训练一个编码器并冻结另一个，以减少内存需求，并避免跨视频的帧对齐。

Result: 在23,027个视频（3,286个标记）上，STPT的AUC达到0.635，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: STPT在有限计算资源下有效解决了胚胎视频分析的挑战，提升了预测性能。

Abstract: Automating embryo viability prediction for in vitro fertilization (IVF) is
important but challenging due to the limited availability of labeled pregnancy
outcome data, as only a small fraction of embryos are labeled after transfer.
Self-supervised learning (SSL) can leverage both labeled and unlabeled data to
improve prediction. However, existing SSL methods for videos are not directly
applicable to embryo development videos due to two challenges: (1) embryo
time-lapse videos contain hundreds of frames, requiring significant GPU memory
for conventional SSL; (2) the dataset contains videos with varying lengths and
many outlier frames, causing traditional video alignment methods to struggle
with semantic misalignment. We propose Spatial-Temporal Pre-Training (STPT) to
address these challenges. STPT includes two stages: spatial and temporal. In
each stage, only one encoder is trained while the other is frozen, reducing
memory demands. To handle temporal misalignment, STPT avoids frame-by-frame
alignment across videos. The spatial stage learns from alignments within each
video and its temporally consistent augmentations. The temporal stage then
models relationships between video embeddings. Our method efficiently handles
long videos and temporal variability. On 23,027 time-lapse videos (3,286
labeled), STPT achieves the highest AUC of 0.635 (95% CI: 0.632-0.638) compared
to baselines, with limited computational resources.

### [10] [VMRA-MaR: An Asymmetry-Aware Temporal Framework for Longitudinal Breast Cancer Risk Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17412)
*Zijun Sun,Solveig Thrun,Michael Kampffmeyer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Vision Mamba RNN（VMRNN）和状态空间模型（SSM）的方法，结合不对称模块，用于乳腺癌风险预测，显著提升了高密度乳腺病例的预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺癌是全球主要死因之一，现有模型多关注最近一次筛查，而忽略了时间动态信息。本文旨在利用纵向影像数据中的时间动态，改进风险预测。

Method: 采用VMRNN结合SSM和LSTM机制捕捉乳腺组织变化趋势，并引入不对称模块（SAD和LAT）检测临床相关双侧差异。

Result: 方法在预测癌症发病方面表现优异，尤其对高密度乳腺病例和长期时间点（第四和第五年）效果显著。

Conclusion: 该方法有望推动乳腺癌早期识别，并支持个性化筛查策略。

Abstract: Breast cancer remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide and is typically
detected via screening programs where healthy people are invited in regular
intervals. Automated risk prediction approaches have the potential to improve
this process by facilitating dynamically screening of high-risk groups. While
most models focus solely on the most recent screening, there is growing
interest in exploiting temporal information to capture evolving trends in
breast tissue, as inspired by clinical practice. Early methods typically relied
on two time steps, and although recent efforts have extended this to multiple
time steps using Transformer architectures, challenges remain in fully
harnessing the rich temporal dynamics inherent in longitudinal imaging data. In
this work, we propose to instead leverage Vision Mamba RNN (VMRNN) with a
state-space model (SSM) and LSTM-like memory mechanisms to effectively capture
nuanced trends in breast tissue evolution. To further enhance our approach, we
incorporate an asymmetry module that utilizes a Spatial Asymmetry Detector
(SAD) and Longitudinal Asymmetry Tracker (LAT) to identify clinically relevant
bilateral differences. This integrated framework demonstrates notable
improvements in predicting cancer onset, especially for the more challenging
high-density breast cases and achieves superior performance at extended time
points (years four and five), highlighting its potential to advance early
breast cancer recognition and enable more personalized screening strategies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合CNN和Transformer的混合模型Trans-CBCT，用于稀疏视图CBCT重建，并通过引入邻居感知的Point Transformer进一步优化，显著提升了重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏视图CBCT扫描速度快且辐射剂量低，但会导致严重的欠采样问题，产生伪影和空间覆盖不足。论文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 1. 使用TransUNet替代传统UNet/ResNet编码器，结合CNN的局部细节捕捉和Transformer的全局上下文增强。2. 引入邻居感知Point Transformer，通过3D位置编码和k近邻注意力提升空间一致性。

Result: 在LUNA16数据集上，Trans-CBCT比基线模型PSNR提升1.17 dB，SSIM提升0.0163；Trans^2-CBCT进一步提升了0.63 dB PSNR和0.0117 SSIM。

Conclusion: 结合CNN-Transformer特征和基于点的几何推理，能有效提升稀疏视图CBCT的重建质量，实验证明了其优越性。

Abstract: Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) using only a few X-ray projection views
enables faster scans with lower radiation dose, but the resulting severe
under-sampling causes strong artifacts and poor spatial coverage. We address
these challenges in a unified framework. First, we replace conventional
UNet/ResNet encoders with TransUNet, a hybrid CNN-Transformer model.
Convolutional layers capture local details, while self-attention layers enhance
global context. We adapt TransUNet to CBCT by combining multi-scale features,
querying view-specific features per 3D point, and adding a lightweight
attenuation-prediction head. This yields Trans-CBCT, which surpasses prior
baselines by 1.17 dB PSNR and 0.0163 SSIM on the LUNA16 dataset with six views.
Second, we introduce a neighbor-aware Point Transformer to enforce volumetric
coherence. This module uses 3D positional encoding and attention over k-nearest
neighbors to improve spatial consistency. The resulting model, Trans$^2$-CBCT,
provides an additional gain of 0.63 dB PSNR and 0.0117 SSIM. Experiments on
LUNA16 and ToothFairy show consistent gains from six to ten views, validating
the effectiveness of combining CNN-Transformer features with point-based
geometry reasoning for sparse-view CBCT reconstruction.

Abstract: In recent years, the rapid growth of the Internet of Things technologies and
the widespread adoption of 5G wireless networks have led to an exponential
increase in the number of radiation devices operating in complex
electromagnetic environments. A key challenge in managing and securing these
devices is accurate identification and classification. To address this
challenge, specific emitter identification techniques have emerged as a
promising solution that aims to provide reliable and efficient means of
identifying individual radiation devices in a unified and standardized manner.
This research proposes an approach that leverages transient energy spectrum
analysis using the General Linear Chirplet Transform to extract features from
RF devices. A dataset comprising nine RF devices is utilized, with each sample
containing 900 attributes and a total of 1080 equally distributed samples
across the devices. These features are then used in a classification modeling
framework. To overcome the limitations of conventional machine learning
methods, we introduce a hybrid deep learning model called the CNN-Bi-GRU for
learning the identification of RF devices based on their transient
characteristics. The proposed approach provided a 10-fold cross-validation
performance with a precision of 99.33%, recall of 99.53%, F1-score of 99.43%,
and classification accuracy of 99.17%. The results demonstrate the promising
classification performance of the CNN-Bi-GRU approach, indicating its
suitability for accurately identifying RF devices based on their transient
characteristics and its potential for enhancing device identification and
classification in complex wireless environments.

Abstract: Robust visual recognition in underwater environments remains a significant
challenge due to complex distortions such as turbidity, low illumination, and
occlusion, which severely degrade the performance of standard vision systems.
This paper introduces AQUA20, a comprehensive benchmark dataset comprising
8,171 underwater images across 20 marine species reflecting real-world
environmental challenges such as illumination, turbidity, occlusions, etc.,
providing a valuable resource for underwater visual understanding. Thirteen
state-of-the-art deep learning models, including lightweight CNNs (SqueezeNet,
MobileNetV2) and transformer-based architectures (ViT, ConvNeXt), were
evaluated to benchmark their performance in classifying marine species under
challenging conditions. Our experimental results show ConvNeXt achieving the
best performance, with a Top-3 accuracy of 98.82% and a Top-1 accuracy of
90.69%, as well as the highest overall F1-score of 88.92% with moderately large
parameter size. The results obtained from our other benchmark models also
demonstrate trade-offs between complexity and performance. We also provide an
extensive explainability analysis using GRAD-CAM and LIME for interpreting the
strengths and pitfalls of the models. Our results reveal substantial room for

Conclusion: 该方法在自动驾驶中实现了快速且高精度的异常检测。

Abstract: Anomaly detection is essential for the safety and reliability of autonomous
driving systems. Current methods often focus on detection accuracy but neglect
response time, which is critical in time-sensitive driving scenarios. In this
paper, we introduce real-time anomaly detection for autonomous driving,
prioritizing both minimal response time and high accuracy. We propose a novel
multimodal asynchronous hybrid network that combines event streams from event
cameras with image data from RGB cameras. Our network utilizes the high
temporal resolution of event cameras through an asynchronous Graph Neural
Network and integrates it with spatial features extracted by a CNN from RGB
images. This combination effectively captures both the temporal dynamics and
spatial details of the driving environment, enabling swift and precise anomaly
detection. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that our approach
outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and response time, achieving
millisecond-level real-time performance.

alleviated using optical grain size analysis integrated into routine
geotechnical laboratory workflow. This paper presents a high-resolution dataset
of 12,714 images of 321 different soil samples collected in the Montreal,
Quebec region, alongside their PSD analysis. It is designed to provide a robust
starting point for training convolutional neural networks (CNN) in geotechnical
applications. Soil samples were photographed in a standardized top-view
position with a resolution of 45 MP and a minimum scale of 39.4 micrometers per
pixel, both in their moist and dry states. A custom test bench employing 13x9
inch white aluminum trays, on which the samples are spread in a thin layer, was
used. For samples exceeding a size limit, a coning and quartering method was
employed for mass reduction.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are gaining attention in medical image
analysis. These are pre-trained on large, heterogeneous data sources, yielding
rich and transferable representations. Notably, the combination of
modality-specialized VLMs with few-shot adaptation has provided fruitful
results, enabling the efficient deployment of high-performing solutions.
However, previous works on this topic make strong assumptions about the
distribution of adaptation data, which are unrealistic in the medical domain.
First, prior art assumes access to a balanced support set, a condition that
breaks the natural imbalance in disease prevalence found in real-world
scenarios. Second, these works typically assume the presence of an additional
validation set to fix critical hyper-parameters, which is highly
data-inefficient. This work challenges these favorable deployment scenarios and
introduces a realistic, imbalanced, validation-free adaptation setting. Our
extensive benchmark across various modalities and downstream tasks demonstrates
that current methods systematically compromise their performance when operating
under realistic conditions, occasionally even performing worse than zero-shot
inference. Also, we introduce a training-free linear probe that adaptively
blends visual and textual supervision. Detailed studies demonstrate that the
proposed solver is a strong, efficient baseline, enabling robust adaptation in
challenging scenarios.

Method: 提出SCA-T方法，通过无监督的转导式适应联合校准和测试数据，解决了传统SCP在迁移学习中的局限性。

Result: 实验表明，SCA-T在效率和条件覆盖方面优于传统SCP，同时保持了相同的经验保证。

Conclusion: SCA-T为医学VLMs的迁移学习提供了一种更可靠且高效的可信度保证方法。

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented
transfer capabilities and are being increasingly adopted for data-efficient
image classification. Despite its growing popularity, its reliability aspect
remains largely unexplored. This work explores the split conformal prediction
(SCP) framework to provide trustworthiness guarantees when transferring such
models based on a small labeled calibration set. Despite its potential, the
generalist nature of the VLMs' pre-training could negatively affect the
properties of the predicted conformal sets for specific tasks. While common
practice in transfer learning for discriminative purposes involves an
adaptation stage, we observe that deploying such a solution for conformal
purposes is suboptimal since adapting the model using the available calibration
data breaks the rigid exchangeability assumptions for test data in SCP. To
address this issue, we propose transductive split conformal adaptation (SCA-T),
a novel pipeline for transfer learning on conformal scenarios, which performs
an unsupervised transductive adaptation jointly on calibration and test data.
We present comprehensive experiments utilizing medical VLMs across various
image modalities, transfer tasks, and non-conformity scores. Our framework
offers consistent gains in efficiency and conditional coverage compared to SCP,
maintaining the same empirical guarantees.

Conclusion: 研究为高尔夫运动提供了可扩展、高保真的运动分析工具，推动了运动表型、个性化装备设计和技能发展的新方向。

Abstract: Despite its importance for performance and injury prevention, golf swing
analysis is limited by isolated metrics, underrepresentation of professional
athletes, and a lack of rich, interpretable movement representations. We
address these gaps with a holistic, data-driven framework for personalized golf
swing analysis from a single wrist-worn sensor. We build a large dataset of
professional swings from publicly available videos, reconstruct full-body 3D
kinematics using biologically accurate human mesh recovery, and generate
synthetic inertial data to train neural networks that infer motion and segment
swing phases from wrist-based input. We learn a compositional, discrete
vocabulary of motion primitives that facilitates the detection and
visualization of technical flaws, and is expressive enough to predict player
identity, club type, sex, and age. Our system accurately estimates full-body
kinematics and swing events from wrist data, delivering lab-grade motion
analysis on-course and supporting early detection of anomalous movement
patterns. Explainability methods reveal subtle, individualized movement
signatures, reinforcing the view that variability is a hallmark of skilled
performance. Longitudinal tracking demonstrates practical value: as one
player's handicap improved from 50 to 2.2 over 1.5 years, our system captured
measurable technical progress and provided targeted, actionable feedback. Our
findings challenge common assumptions, such as swing consistency across clubs
and the existence of a single "ideal" swing, and uncover latent biomarkers
shaped by both intrinsic traits and task-specific constraints. This work
bridges lab and field-based biomechanics, offering scalable, accessible,
high-fidelity motion analysis for research, coaching, and injury prevention,
while opening new directions in movement-based phenotyping, personalized
equipment design, and motor skill development.

TL;DR: Scene-R1是一个基于视频的框架，通过强化学习和两阶段定位管道，无需3D实例监督即可理解3D场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D感知大语言模型依赖预训练3D检测器，且决策过程不透明。Scene-R1旨在消除对3D检测器的依赖，并提供透明的推理过程。

Method: 采用强化学习驱动的两阶段定位管道：时间定位选择相关视频片段，图像定位预测2D边界框，并通过SAM2生成像素级掩码并投影回3D。

Result: Scene-R1在多个数据集上超越现有基线，同时提供透明的逐步推理。

Conclusion: 结合强化学习和RGB-D视频，Scene-R1提供了一种高效且可信的3D场景理解方法。

Abstract: Currently, utilizing large language models to understand the 3D world is
becoming popular. Yet existing 3D-aware LLMs act as black boxes: they output
bounding boxes or textual answers without revealing how those decisions are
made, and they still rely on pre-trained 3D detectors to supply object
proposals. We introduce Scene-R1, a video-grounded framework that learns to
reason about 3D scenes without any point-wise 3D instance supervision by
pairing reinforcement-learning-driven reasoning with a two-stage grounding
pipeline. In the temporal grounding stage, we explicitly reason about the video
and select the video snippets most relevant to an open-ended query. In the
subsequent image grounding stage, we analyze the image and predict the 2D
bounding box. After that, we track the object using SAM2 to produce
pixel-accurate masks in RGB frames, and project them back into 3D, thereby
eliminating the need for 3D detector-based proposals while capturing fine
geometry and material cues. Scene-R1 can also adapt to the 3D visual question
answering task to answer free-form questions directly from video. Our training
pipeline only needs task-level 2D boxes or textual labels without dense 3D
point-wise labels. Scene-R1 surpasses existing open-vocabulary baselines on
multiple datasets, while delivering transparent, step-by-step rationales. These
results show that reinforcement-learning-based reasoning combined with RGB-D
video alone offers a practical, annotation-efficient route to trustworthy 3D
scene understanding.

Conclusion: 结论表明SynDaCaTE数据集有助于评估胶囊网络，并揭示了自注意力机制在部分-整体推理中的潜力。

Abstract: Learning to infer object representations, and in particular part-whole
hierarchies, has been the focus of extensive research in computer vision, in
pursuit of improving data efficiency, systematic generalisation, and
robustness. Models which are \emph{designed} to infer part-whole hierarchies,
often referred to as capsule networks, are typically trained end-to-end on
supervised tasks such as object classification, in which case it is difficult
to evaluate whether such a model \emph{actually} learns to infer part-whole
hierarchies, as claimed. To address this difficulty, we present a SYNthetic
DAtaset for CApsule Testing and Evaluation, abbreviated as SynDaCaTE, and
establish its utility by (1) demonstrating the precise bottleneck in a
prominent existing capsule model, and (2) demonstrating that
permutation-equivariant self-attention is highly effective for parts-to-wholes
inference, which motivates future directions for designing effective inductive
biases for computer vision.

Conclusion: 视觉基础规划和分层VLA范式是提升VLA模型性能的关键方向，尽管存在速度上的权衡。

Abstract: Recent studies on Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shifted from the
end-to-end action-generation paradigm toward a pipeline involving task planning
followed by action generation, demonstrating improved performance on various
complex, long-horizon manipulation tasks. However, existing approaches vary
significantly in terms of network architectures, planning paradigms,
representations, and training data sources, making it challenging for
researchers to identify the precise sources of performance gains and components
to be further improved. To systematically investigate the impacts of different
planning paradigms and representations isolating from network architectures and
training data, in this paper, we introduce VLA-OS, a unified VLA architecture
series capable of various task planning paradigms, and design a comprehensive
suite of controlled experiments across diverse object categories (rigid and
deformable), visual modalities (2D and 3D), environments (simulation and
real-world), and end-effectors (grippers and dexterous hands). Our results
demonstrate that: 1) visually grounded planning representations are generally
better than language planning representations; 2) the Hierarchical-VLA paradigm
generally achieves superior or comparable performance than other paradigms on
task performance, pretraining, generalization ability, scalability, and
continual learning ability, albeit at the cost of slower training and inference
speeds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗图像-报告数据分散且隐私敏感，集中化困难，阻碍了LLM驱动的医疗报告生成模型的发展。

Method: 采用低秩分解减少通信开销，结合客户端感知对比学习和双适配器机制处理数据异质性。

Result: FedMRG在通信效率和临床报告准确性上表现优异，适用于多中心数据。

Conclusion: FedMRG为隐私保护的多中心医疗报告生成提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated significant potential in Medical Report Generation
(MRG), yet their development requires large amounts of medical image-report
pairs, which are commonly scattered across multiple centers. Centralizing these
data is exceptionally challenging due to privacy regulations, thereby impeding
model development and broader adoption of LLM-driven MRG models. To address
this challenge, we present FedMRG, the first framework that leverages Federated
Learning (FL) to enable privacy-preserving, multi-center development of
LLM-driven MRG models, specifically designed to overcome the critical challenge
of communication-efficient LLM training under multi-modal data heterogeneity.
To start with, our framework tackles the fundamental challenge of communication
overhead in FL-LLM tuning by employing low-rank factorization to efficiently
decompose parameter updates, significantly reducing gradient transmission costs
and making LLM-driven MRG feasible in bandwidth-constrained FL settings.
Furthermore, we observed the dual heterogeneity in MRG under the FL scenario:
varying image characteristics across medical centers, as well as diverse
reporting styles and terminology preferences. To address this, we further
enhance FedMRG with (1) client-aware contrastive learning in the MRG encoder,
coupled with diagnosis-driven prompts, which capture both globally
generalizable and locally distinctive features while maintaining diagnostic
accuracy; and (2) a dual-adapter mutual boosting mechanism in the MRG decoder
that harmonizes generic and specialized adapters to address variations in
reporting styles and terminology. Through extensive evaluation of our
established FL-MRG benchmark, we demonstrate the generalizability and
adaptability of FedMRG, underscoring its potential in harnessing multi-center
data and generating clinically accurate reports while maintaining communication
efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）在生成文本时容易出现视觉不真实的幻觉问题，现有方法通常需要大量资源或任务特定配置，因此需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出HalluRNN架构，采用双门深度传播单元（DG-DPU）模块，通过跨层循环推理增强模型稳定性，自适应传播信息并减少表示漂移导致的幻觉。

Result: 仅微调DG-DPU模块的HalluRNN在多个基准测试中表现出色且稳健。

Conclusion: HalluRNN通过架构级创新有效减少了LVLM的幻觉问题，且资源需求较低。

Abstract: Though Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable
performance across various tasks, they are still prone to
hallucinations-generating outputs that are textually plausible but visually
ungrounded. While prior approaches generally address this issue through
data-centric fine-tuning or innovative decoding strategies, these methods often
require substantial resources or task-specific configurations. In this work, we
introduce an architecture-level solution, HalluRNN, which enhances model
stability through recurrent cross-layer reasoning. Specifically, we propose a
novel Dual-Gated Depth Propagation Unit (DG-DPU) module, which is shared across
layers and recurrently refines hidden states. This allows for the adaptive
propagation of information throughout the model, enforces consistency across
layers, and mitigates hallucinations caused by representational drift. By
fine-tuning only the DG-DPU module, HalluRNN achieves strong and robust
performance across multiple benchmarks.

Motivation: 解决现有视觉语言模型在细粒度意图推理和风险评估方面的不足，尤其是在安全关键场景中。

Method: 提出DRAMA-X基准测试和SGG-Intent框架，利用场景图和大型语言模型进行意图推理和风险评估。

Result: 实验表明，基于场景图的推理显著提升了意图预测和风险评估的性能。

Conclusion: DRAMA-X和SGG-Intent为自动驾驶决策提供了有效的评估工具和方法。

Abstract: Understanding the short-term motion of vulnerable road users (VRUs) like
pedestrians and cyclists is critical for safe autonomous driving, especially in
urban scenarios with ambiguous or high-risk behaviors. While vision-language
models (VLMs) have enabled open-vocabulary perception, their utility for
fine-grained intent reasoning remains underexplored. Notably, no existing
benchmark evaluates multi-class intent prediction in safety-critical
situations, To address this gap, we introduce DRAMA-X, a fine-grained benchmark
constructed from the DRAMA dataset via an automated annotation pipeline.
DRAMA-X contains 5,686 accident-prone frames labeled with object bounding
boxes, a nine-class directional intent taxonomy, binary risk scores,
expert-generated action suggestions for the ego vehicle, and descriptive motion
summaries. These annotations enable a structured evaluation of four
interrelated tasks central to autonomous decision-making: object detection,
intent prediction, risk assessment, and action suggestion. As a reference
baseline, we propose SGG-Intent, a lightweight, training-free framework that
mirrors the ego vehicle's reasoning pipeline. It sequentially generates a scene
graph from visual input using VLM-backed detectors, infers intent, assesses
risk, and recommends an action using a compositional reasoning stage powered by
a large language model. We evaluate a range of recent VLMs, comparing
performance across all four DRAMA-X tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that
scene-graph-based reasoning enhances intent prediction and risk assessment,
especially when contextual cues are explicitly modeled.

TL;DR: SELFI框架通过动态调节身份特征的使用，提升了深度伪造检测的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决身份特征在深度伪造检测中的矛盾观点：是否抑制或依赖身份特征。

Method: 提出SELFI框架，包括Forgery-Aware Identity Adapter（FAIA）和Identity-Aware Fusion Module（IAFM），动态整合身份与视觉特征。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，SELFI平均AUC提升3.1%，在DFDC数据集上提升6%。

Conclusion: 身份特征应被显式建模并动态控制，而非盲目抑制或依赖。

Abstract: Face identity provides a powerful signal for deepfake detection. Prior
studies show that even when not explicitly modeled, classifiers often learn
identity features implicitly. This has led to conflicting views: some suppress
identity cues to reduce bias, while others rely on them as forensic evidence.
To reconcile these views, we analyze two hypotheses: (1) whether face identity
alone is discriminative for detecting deepfakes, and (2) whether such identity
features generalize poorly across manipulation methods. Our experiments confirm
that identity is informative but context-dependent. While some manipulations
preserve identity-consistent artifacts, others distort identity cues and harm
generalization. We argue that identity features should neither be blindly
suppressed nor relied upon, but instead be explicitly modeled and adaptively
controlled based on per-sample relevance. We propose \textbf{SELFI}
(\textbf{SEL}ective \textbf{F}usion of \textbf{I}dentity), a generalizable
detection framework that dynamically modulates identity usage. SELFI consists
of: (1) a Forgery-Aware Identity Adapter (FAIA) that extracts identity
embeddings from a frozen face recognition model and projects them into a
forgery-relevant space via auxiliary supervision; and (2) an Identity-Aware
Fusion Module (IAFM) that selectively integrates identity and visual features
using a relevance-guided fusion mechanism. Experiments on four benchmarks show
that SELFI improves cross-manipulation generalization, outperforming prior
methods by an average of 3.1\% AUC. On the challenging DFDC dataset, SELFI
exceeds the previous best by 6\%. Code will be released upon paper acceptance.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD), characterized by its incurable nature, rapid
progression, and severe disability, poses significant challenges to the lives
of patients and their families. Given the aging population, the need for early
detection of PD is increasing. In vitro diagnosis has garnered attention due to
its non-invasive nature and low cost. However, existing methods present several
challenges: 1) limited training data for facial expression diagnosis; 2)
specialized equipment and acquisition environments required for gait diagnosis,
resulting in poor generalizability; 3) the risk of misdiagnosis or missed
diagnosis when relying on a single modality. To address these issues, we
propose a novel multimodal in vitro diagnostic method for PD, leveraging facial
expressions and behavioral gait. Our method employs a lightweight deep learning
model for feature extraction and fusion, aimed at improving diagnostic accuracy
and facilitating deployment on mobile devices. Furthermore, we have established
the largest multimodal PD dataset in collaboration with a hospital and
conducted extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of our proposed
method.

Abstract: Purpose: To develop an age prediction model which is interpretable and robust
to demographic and technological variances in brain MRI scans. Materials and
Methods: We propose a transformer-based architecture that leverages
self-supervised pre-training on large-scale datasets. Our model processes
pseudo-3D T1-weighted MRI scans from three anatomical views and incorporates
brain volumetric information. By introducing a stem architecture, we reduce the
conventional quadratic complexity of transformer models to linear complexity,
enabling scalability for high-dimensional MRI data. We trained our model on
ADNI2 $\&$ 3 (N=1348) and OASIS3 (N=716) datasets (age range: 42 - 95) from the
North America, with an 8:1:1 split for train, validation and test. Then, we
validated it on the AIBL dataset (N=768, age range: 60 - 92) from Australia.
Results: We achieved an MAE of 3.65 years on ADNI2 $\&$ 3 and OASIS3 test set
and a high generalizability of MAE of 3.54 years on AIBL. There was a notable
increase in brain age gap (BAG) across cognitive groups, with mean of 0.15
years (95% CI: [-0.22, 0.51]) in CN, 2.55 years ([2.40, 2.70]) in MCI, 6.12
years ([5.82, 6.43]) in AD. Additionally, significant negative correlation
between BAG and cognitive scores was observed, with correlation coefficient of
-0.185 (p < 0.001) for MoCA and -0.231 (p < 0.001) for MMSE. Gradient-based
feature attribution highlighted ventricles and white matter structures as key
regions influenced by brain aging. Conclusion: Our model effectively fused
information from different views and volumetric information to achieve
state-of-the-art brain age prediction accuracy, improved generalizability and
interpretability with association to neurodegenerative disorders.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种浅层特征增强方法，通过特征上采样显著降低计算成本，同时保持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率图像特征在多模态大语言模型中表现优异，但计算成本高昂，需多次调用大型图像编码器。

Method: 提出浅层特征增强器，通过特征上采样减少计算量。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在训练、推理时间和计算成本上大幅降低（FLOPs节省1.5倍），同时保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 浅层特征增强是一种高效且经济的高分辨率特征生成方法。

Abstract: The integration of high-resolution image features in modern multimodal large
language models has demonstrated significant improvements in fine-grained
visual understanding tasks, achieving high performance across multiple
benchmarks. Since these features are obtained from large image encoders like
ViT, they come with a significant increase in computational costs due to
multiple calls to these encoders. In this work, we first develop an intuition
for feature upsampling as a natural extension of high-resolution feature
generation. Through extensive experiments and ablations, we demonstrate how a
shallow feature enricher can achieve competitive results with tremendous
reductions in training and inference time as well as computational cost, with
upto 1.5x saving in FLOPs.

TL;DR: JarvisArt是一个基于多模态大语言模型的智能修图代理，通过两阶段训练和专有协议实现与Lightroom的无缝集成，提供用户友好、可泛化且精细的修图控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI修图工具自动化能力有限且泛化性差，无法满足个性化需求，JarvisArt旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：Chain-of-Thought监督微调建立基础推理能力，GRPO-R优化决策与工具使用；提出Agent-to-Lightroom协议。

Result: 在MMArt-Bench上，JarvisArt在内容保真度上比GPT-4o提升60%，同时保持指令跟随能力。

Conclusion: JarvisArt为智能修图开辟了新途径，兼具用户友好性和专业级控制能力。

Abstract: Photo retouching has become integral to contemporary visual storytelling,
enabling users to capture aesthetics and express creativity. While professional
tools such as Adobe Lightroom offer powerful capabilities, they demand
substantial expertise and manual effort. In contrast, existing AI-based
solutions provide automation but often suffer from limited adjustability and
poor generalization, failing to meet diverse and personalized editing needs. To
bridge this gap, we introduce JarvisArt, a multi-modal large language model
(MLLM)-driven agent that understands user intent, mimics the reasoning process
of professional artists, and intelligently coordinates over 200 retouching
tools within Lightroom. JarvisArt undergoes a two-stage training process: an
initial Chain-of-Thought supervised fine-tuning to establish basic reasoning
and tool-use skills, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization for
Retouching (GRPO-R) to further enhance its decision-making and tool
proficiency. We also propose the Agent-to-Lightroom Protocol to facilitate
seamless integration with Lightroom. To evaluate performance, we develop
MMArt-Bench, a novel benchmark constructed from real-world user edits.
JarvisArt demonstrates user-friendly interaction, superior generalization, and
fine-grained control over both global and local adjustments, paving a new
avenue for intelligent photo retouching. Notably, it outperforms GPT-4o with a
60% improvement in average pixel-level metrics on MMArt-Bench for content
fidelity, while maintaining comparable instruction-following capabilities.

*Kailing Li,Qi'ao Xu,Tianwen Qian,Yuqian Fu,Yang Jiao,Xiaoling Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLiViS是一个无需训练的新框架，结合LLMs的任务规划和VLMs的视觉感知，通过动态认知地图解决EVR中的复杂指令和时空动态问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EVR面临复杂指令多样性和长期视频时空动态的挑战，现有方法（LLMs或VLMs）各有不足，需结合两者优势。

Method: CLiViS利用LLMs进行任务规划，VLMs进行视觉感知，通过动态认知地图迭代更新场景上下文。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，尤其在处理长期视觉依赖时。

Conclusion: CLiViS通过结合LLMs和VLMs的优势，有效解决了EVR的核心挑战。

Abstract: Embodied Visual Reasoning (EVR) seeks to follow complex, free-form
instructions based on egocentric video, enabling semantic understanding and
spatiotemporal reasoning in dynamic environments. Despite its promising
potential, EVR encounters significant challenges stemming from the diversity of
complex instructions and the intricate spatiotemporal dynamics in long-term
egocentric videos. Prior solutions either employ Large Language Models (LLMs)
over static video captions, which often omit critical visual details, or rely
on end-to-end Vision-Language Models (VLMs) that struggle with stepwise
compositional reasoning. Consider the complementary strengths of LLMs in
reasoning and VLMs in perception, we propose CLiViS. It is a novel
training-free framework that leverages LLMs for high-level task planning and
orchestrates VLM-driven open-world visual perception to iteratively update the
scene context. Building on this synergy, the core of CLiViS is a dynamic
Cognitive Map that evolves throughout the reasoning process. This map
constructs a structured representation of the embodied scene, bridging
low-level perception and high-level reasoning. Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of CLiViS,
especially in handling long-term visual dependencies. Code is available at

### [31] [Optimization-Free Patch Attack on Stereo Depth Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17632)
*Hangcheng Liu,Xu Kuang,Xingshuo Han,Xingwan Wu,Haoran Ou,Shangwei Guo,Xingyi Huang,Tao Xiang,Tianwei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了PatchHunter，一种无需优化的对抗性补丁攻击方法，用于攻击立体深度估计（SDE）模型，解决了现有攻击方法在现实场景中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SDE模型的对抗攻击方法多局限于不现实的设置（如静态场景中的数字扰动），缺乏实际应用性。论文旨在设计一种物理可实现、场景自适应且可迁移的攻击方法。

Method: 提出PatchHunter，通过强化学习驱动的搜索在视觉模式空间中生成对抗补丁，无需优化。该方法覆盖了立体匹配的四个核心阶段。

Result: PatchHunter在KITTI数据集、CARLA模拟器和真实车辆部署中表现优异，攻击成功率高（如D1-all > 0.4），且具有更好的黑盒迁移性。

Conclusion: PatchHunter为SDE模型提供了一种高效且实用的对抗攻击方法，优于传统优化方法，尤其在复杂物理条件下表现突出。

Abstract: Stereo Depth Estimation (SDE) is essential for scene understanding in
vision-based systems like autonomous driving. However, recent studies show that
SDE models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which are often limited to
unrealistic settings, e.g., digital perturbations on separate stereo views in
static scenes, restricting their real-world applicability. This raises a
critical question: how can we design physically realizable, scene-adaptive, and
transferable attacks against SDE under realistic constraints?
  To answer this, we make two key contributions. First, we propose a unified
attack framework that extends optimization-based techniques to four core stages
of stereo matching: feature extraction, cost-volume construction, cost
aggregation, and disparity regression. A comprehensive stage-wise evaluation
across 9 mainstream SDE models, under constraints like photometric consistency,
reveals that optimization-based patches suffer from poor transferability.
Interestingly, partially transferable patches suggest that patterns, rather
than pixel-level perturbations, may be key to generalizable attacks. Motivated
by this, we present PatchHunter, the first optimization-free adversarial patch
attack against SDE. PatchHunter formulates patch generation as a reinforcement
learning-driven search over a structured space of visual patterns crafted to
disrupt SDE assumptions.
  We validate PatchHunter across three levels: the KITTI dataset, the CARLA
simulator, and real-world vehicle deployment. PatchHunter not only surpasses
optimization-based methods in effectiveness but also achieves significantly
better black-box transferability. Even under challenging physical conditions
like low light, PatchHunter maintains high attack success (e.g., D1-all > 0.4),
whereas optimization-based methods fail.

### [32] [Adaptive Multi-prompt Contrastive Network for Few-shot Out-of-distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17633)
*Xiang Fang,Arvind Easwaran,Blaise Genest*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为AMCN的新网络，用于少样本OOD检测，通过自适应多提示对比学习解决传统方法依赖大量IID样本的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统OOD检测方法需要大量IID样本训练，限制了实际应用。少样本OOD检测更具挑战性，且现有方法忽略了类间多样性。

Method: 提出AMCN网络，利用CLIP连接文本与图像，生成自适应提示（可学习ID提示、固定标签OOD提示和自适应标签OOD提示），并通过类间阈值和提示引导模块优化ID-OOD分离。

Result: 实验表明AMCN优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: AMCN通过自适应提示和类间分布学习，有效解决了少样本OOD检测的挑战。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection attempts to distinguish outlier samples
to prevent models trained on the in-distribution (ID) dataset from producing
unavailable outputs. Most OOD detection methods require many IID samples for
training, which seriously limits their real-world applications. To this end, we
target a challenging setting: few-shot OOD detection, where {Only a few {\em
labeled ID} samples are available.} Therefore, few-shot OOD detection is much
more challenging than the traditional OOD detection setting. Previous few-shot
OOD detection works ignore the distinct diversity between different classes. In
this paper, we propose a novel network: Adaptive Multi-prompt Contrastive
Network (AMCN), which adapts the ID-OOD separation boundary by learning inter-
and intra-class distribution. To compensate for the absence of OOD and scarcity
of ID {\em image samples}, we leverage CLIP, connecting text with images,
engineering learnable ID and OOD {\em textual prompts}. Specifically, we first
generate adaptive prompts (learnable ID prompts, label-fixed OOD prompts and
label-adaptive OOD prompts). Then, we generate an adaptive class boundary for
each class by introducing a class-wise threshold. Finally, we propose a
prompt-guided ID-OOD separation module to control the margin between ID and OOD
prompts. Experimental results show that AMCN outperforms other state-of-the-art
works.

Method: 提出PathGenIC框架，结合多模态上下文学习机制，动态检索相似图像-报告对并引入自适应反馈。

Result: 在HistGen基准测试中，BLEU、METEOR和ROUGE-L指标显著提升，且对不同报告长度和疾病类别具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PathGenIC为AI驱动的病理报告生成提供了解决方案，为多模态临床应用的未来发展奠定基础。

Abstract: Automating medical report generation from histopathology images is a critical
challenge requiring effective visual representations and domain-specific
knowledge. Inspired by the common practices of human experts, we propose an
in-context learning framework called PathGenIC that integrates context derived
from the training set with a multimodal in-context learning (ICL) mechanism.
Our method dynamically retrieves semantically similar whole slide image
(WSI)-report pairs and incorporates adaptive feedback to enhance contextual
relevance and generation quality. Evaluated on the HistGen benchmark, the
framework achieves state-of-the-art results, with significant improvements
across BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE-L metrics, and demonstrates robustness across
diverse report lengths and disease categories. By maximizing training data
utility and bridging vision and language with ICL, our work offers a solution
for AI-driven histopathology reporting, setting a strong foundation for future
advancements in multimodal clinical applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的方法MDSAM，通过动态调整图像标记的注意力来减少大型视觉语言模型中的幻觉现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在解码时对图像标记的敏感性导致幻觉问题，需解决。

Method: 提出MDSAM方法，动态捕捉和优化各层的注意力分配，通过记忆和更新注意力模式减少幻觉。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，MDSAM能持续减少幻觉并提高模型可靠性。

Conclusion: MDSAM无需额外训练或工具，适用于多种LVLM架构，有效减少幻觉。

Abstract: Hallucinations in large vision-language models (LVLMs) often stem from the
model's sensitivity to image tokens during decoding, as evidenced by attention
peaks observed when generating both real and hallucinated entities. To address
this, we propose Memory-Driven Sparse Attention Matrix (MDSAM) , a novel
training-free approach that dynamically captures and refines the attention
allocated to image tokens at each layer. MDSAM memorizes attention patterns and
activates updates through alignment during decoding, enhancing focus on
relevant image tokens while effectively reducing hallucinations. We evaluate
MDSAM on multiple benchmarks for tasks such as image captioning and visual
question answering, demonstrating its ability to consistently reduce
hallucinations and improve reliability. Compatible with various LVLM
architectures, MDSAM highlights its adaptability and effectiveness in
mitigating hallucinations without requiring additional training or external
tools.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Transformer的检测头CSDN，通过引入门控机制替代传统自注意力和交叉注意力层，提升了CNN骨干网络的全局上下文建模能力，并适应不同大小和结构的物体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN在目标检测中因有限感受野而难以捕捉全局上下文信息，且DETR架构中的自注意力机制存在信息冗余问题。

Method: 提出CSDN，采用门控机制自适应选择和组合多注意力模式的特征维度和尺度信息。

Result: CSDN显著提高了检测精度，且仅需少量微调即可适配多种CNN检测器。

Conclusion: CSDN通过高效利用CNN特征和门控机制，实现了更强的全局建模能力和适应性。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have long been the cornerstone of target
detection, but they are often limited by limited receptive fields, which
hinders their ability to capture global contextual information. This paper
believes that the effective utilization of extracted features is as important
as the feature extraction process itself. We critically re-evaluated the
DETR-inspired header network architecture, questioning the indispensable nature
of its self-attention mechanism, and discovering significant information
redundancies. To solve these problems, we introduced the Context-Gated
Scale-Adaptive Detection Network (CSDN), a Transformer-based detection header
inspired by natural language processing architecture and human visual
perception. CSDN aims to efficiently utilize the characteristics of the CNN
backbone network by replacing the traditional stacked self-attention and
cross-attention layers with a novel gating mechanism. This mechanism enables
each region of interest (ROI) to adaptively select and combine feature
dimensions and scale information from multiple attention patterns. CSDN
provides more powerful global context modeling capabilities and can better
adapt to objects of different sizes and structures. Our proposed detection head
can directly replace the native heads of various CNN-based detectors, and only
a few rounds of fine-tuning on the pre-training weights can significantly
improve the detection accuracy, thus avoiding the need to achieve small
improvements. Various layer modules undergo extensive re-training.

Motivation: 解决第一人称视角动作识别模型在未见环境中性能下降的问题，利用动作序列的一致性意图提升泛化能力。

Method: 提出SeqDG方法，包含视觉-文本序列重构目标（SeqRec）和跨域动作序列混合训练（SeqMix）。

Result: 在EPIC-KITCHENS-100数据集上，跨域动作识别性能提升2.4%；在EGTEA数据集上，域内动作识别Top-1准确率提升0.6%。

Conclusion: SeqDG通过序列重构和混合训练有效提升了第一人称动作识别的泛化能力，尤其在未见环境中表现优异。

Abstract: Recognizing human activities from visual inputs, particularly through a
first-person viewpoint, is essential for enabling robots to replicate human
behavior. Egocentric vision, characterized by cameras worn by observers,
captures diverse changes in illumination, viewpoint, and environment. This
variability leads to a notable drop in the performance of Egocentric Action
Recognition models when tested in environments not seen during training. In
this paper, we tackle these challenges by proposing a domain generalization
approach for Egocentric Action Recognition. Our insight is that action
sequences often reflect consistent user intent across visual domains. By
leveraging action sequences, we aim to enhance the model's generalization
ability across unseen environments. Our proposed method, named SeqDG,
introduces a visual-text sequence reconstruction objective (SeqRec) that uses
contextual cues from both text and visual inputs to reconstruct the central
action of the sequence. Additionally, we enhance the model's robustness by
training it on mixed sequences of actions from different domains (SeqMix). We
validate SeqDG on the EGTEA and EPIC-KITCHENS-100 datasets. Results on
EPIC-KITCHENS-100, show that SeqDG leads to +2.4% relative average improvement
in cross-domain action recognition in unseen environments, and on EGTEA the
model achieved +0.6% Top-1 accuracy over SOTA in intra-domain action
recognition.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在无标注数据的情况下性能优越，且计算成本低于传统方法。

Conclusion: 提出的统一框架在音频-视觉说话人验证中具有高效性和鲁棒性，适用于多模态输入。

Abstract: Conventional audio-visual methods for speaker verification rely on large
amounts of labeled data and separate modality-specific architectures, which is
computationally expensive, limiting their scalability. To address these
problems, we propose a self-supervised learning framework based on contrastive
learning with asymmetric masking and masked data modeling to obtain robust
audiovisual feature representations. In particular, we employ a unified
framework for self-supervised audiovisual speaker verification using a single
shared backbone for audio and visual inputs, leveraging the versatility of
vision transformers. The proposed unified framework can handle audio, visual,
or audiovisual inputs using a single shared vision transformer backbone during
training and testing while being computationally efficient and robust to
missing modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
competitive performance without labeled data while reducing computational costs
compared to traditional approaches.

TL;DR: DreamJourney提出了一种两阶段框架，利用视频扩散模型的能力生成动态场景的长期视频，解决了现有方法在3D感知和动态对象运动方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法基于2D扩散模型，缺乏3D感知能力且无法捕捉动态对象运动，导致生成视频中存在失真和静态场景限制。

Method: DreamJourney分为两阶段：阶段I将输入图像提升为3D点云并渲染部分图像序列，利用视频扩散模型补全缺失区域；阶段II通过多模态大语言模型生成描述对象运动的文本提示，并用视频扩散模型动态化当前视图。

Result: 实验表明，DreamJourney在定量和定性上均优于现有方法，能够生成更高质量的动态场景视频。

Conclusion: DreamJourney通过结合3D感知和动态对象运动，实现了长期动态场景视频的生成，为相关任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Perpetual view generation aims to synthesize a long-term video corresponding
to an arbitrary camera trajectory solely from a single input image. Recent
methods commonly utilize a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model to
synthesize new content of previously unseen regions along camera movement.
However, the underlying 2D diffusion model lacks 3D awareness and results in
distorted artifacts. Moreover, they are limited to generating views of static
3D scenes, neglecting to capture object movements within the dynamic 4D world.
To alleviate these issues, we present DreamJourney, a two-stage framework that
leverages the world simulation capacity of video diffusion models to trigger a
new perpetual scene view generation task with both camera movements and object
dynamics. Specifically, in stage I, DreamJourney first lifts the input image to
3D point cloud and renders a sequence of partial images from a specific camera
trajectory. A video diffusion model is then utilized as generative prior to
complete the missing regions and enhance visual coherence across the sequence,
producing a cross-view consistent video adheres to the 3D scene and camera
trajectory. Meanwhile, we introduce two simple yet effective strategies (early
stopping and view padding) to further stabilize the generation process and
improve visual quality. Next, in stage II, DreamJourney leverages a multimodal
large language model to produce a text prompt describing object movements in
current view, and uses video diffusion model to animate current view with
object movements. Stage I and II are repeated recurrently, enabling perpetual
dynamic scene view generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of our DreamJourney over state-of-the-art methods both
quantitatively and qualitatively. Our project page:

Abstract: We present Programmable-Room, a framework which interactively generates and
edits a 3D room mesh, given natural language instructions. For precise control
of a room's each attribute, we decompose the challenging task into simpler
steps such as creating plausible 3D coordinates for room meshes, generating
panorama images for the texture, constructing 3D meshes by integrating the
coordinates and panorama texture images, and arranging furniture. To support
the various decomposed tasks with a unified framework, we incorporate visual
programming (VP). VP is a method that utilizes a large language model (LLM) to
write a Python-like program which is an ordered list of necessary modules for
the various tasks given in natural language. We develop most of the modules.
Especially, for the texture generating module, we utilize a pretrained
large-scale diffusion model to generate panorama images conditioned on text and
visual prompts (i.e., layout, depth, and semantic map) simultaneously.
Specifically, we enhance the panorama image generation quality by optimizing
the training objective with a 1D representation of a panorama scene obtained
from bidirectional LSTM. We demonstrate Programmable-Room's flexibility in
generating and editing 3D room meshes, and prove our framework's superiority to
an existing model quantitatively and qualitatively. Project page is available

Motivation: 骨盆辐射损伤（PRI）的精确分割对预后评估和个性化治疗计划至关重要，但自动化分割因器官形态复杂和上下文混淆而具有挑战性。

Result: 在首个大规模骨盆辐射损伤数据集上评估，PDC-Net优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PDC-Net通过分而治之的策略和灵活的特征选择，显著提升了PRI分割的准确性。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of Pelvic Radiation Injury (PRI) from Magnetic
Resonance Images (MRI) is crucial for more precise prognosis assessment and the
development of personalized treatment plans. However, automated segmentation
remains challenging due to factors such as complex organ morphologies and
confusing context. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Pattern
Divide-and-Conquer Network (PDC-Net) for PRI segmentation. The core idea is to
use different network modules to "divide" various local and global patterns
and, through flexible feature selection, to "conquer" the Regions of Interest
(ROI) during the decoding phase. Specifically, considering that our ROI often
manifests as strip-like or circular-like structures in MR slices, we introduce
a Multi-Direction Aggregation (MDA) module. This module enhances the model's
ability to fit the shape of the organ by applying strip convolutions in four
distinct directions. Additionally, to mitigate the challenge of confusing
context, we propose a Memory-Guided Context (MGC) module. This module
explicitly maintains a memory parameter to track cross-image patterns at the
dataset level, thereby enhancing the distinction between global patterns
associated with the positive and negative classes. Finally, we design an
Adaptive Fusion Decoder (AFD) that dynamically selects features from different
patterns based on the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework, ultimately generating
the final segmentation results. We evaluate our method on the first large-scale
pelvic radiation injury dataset, and the results demonstrate the superiority of
our PDC-Net over existing approaches.

Motivation: 解决YOLO系列模型在复杂场景中因局部信息聚合和成对相关性建模而导致的性能限制。

Method: 引入HyperACE机制捕获全局多对多高阶相关性，设计FullPAD范式实现细粒度信息流，并采用深度可分离卷积降低计算复杂度。

Conclusion: YOLOv13通过全局相关性建模和轻量化设计，实现了高效且高性能的实时目标检测。

Abstract: The YOLO series models reign supreme in real-time object detection due to
their superior accuracy and computational efficiency. However, both the
convolutional architectures of YOLO11 and earlier versions and the area-based
self-attention mechanism introduced in YOLOv12 are limited to local information
aggregation and pairwise correlation modeling, lacking the capability to
capture global multi-to-multi high-order correlations, which limits detection
performance in complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose YOLOv13, an
accurate and lightweight object detector. To address the above-mentioned
challenges, we propose a Hypergraph-based Adaptive Correlation Enhancement
(HyperACE) mechanism that adaptively exploits latent high-order correlations
and overcomes the limitation of previous methods that are restricted to
pairwise correlation modeling based on hypergraph computation, achieving
efficient global cross-location and cross-scale feature fusion and enhancement.
Subsequently, we propose a Full-Pipeline Aggregation-and-Distribution (FullPAD)
paradigm based on HyperACE, which effectively achieves fine-grained information
flow and representation synergy within the entire network by distributing
correlation-enhanced features to the full pipeline. Finally, we propose to
leverage depthwise separable convolutions to replace vanilla large-kernel
convolutions, and design a series of blocks that significantly reduce
parameters and computational complexity without sacrificing performance. We
conduct extensive experiments on the widely used MS COCO benchmark, and the
experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance with fewer parameters and FLOPs. Specifically, our YOLOv13-N
improves mAP by 3.0\% over YOLO11-N and by 1.5\% over YOLOv12-N. The code and
models of our YOLOv13 model are available at:

Abstract: Transforming static images into interactive experiences remains a challenging
task in computer vision. Tackling this challenge holds the potential to elevate
mobile user experiences, notably through interactive and AR/VR applications.
Current approaches aim to achieve this either using pre-recorded video
responses or requiring multi-view images as input. In this paper, we present
PhysID, that streamlines the creation of physics-based interactive dynamics
from a single-view image by leveraging large generative models for 3D mesh
generation and physical property prediction. This significantly reduces the
expertise required for engineering-intensive tasks like 3D modeling and
intrinsic property calibration, enabling the process to be scaled with minimal
manual intervention. We integrate an on-device physics-based engine for
physically plausible real-time rendering with user interactions. PhysID
represents a leap forward in mobile-based interactive dynamics, offering
real-time, non-deterministic interactions and user-personalization with
efficient on-device memory consumption. Experiments evaluate the zero-shot
capabilities of various Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on diverse
tasks and the performance of 3D reconstruction models. These results
demonstrate the cohesive functioning of all modules within the end-to-end
framework, contributing to its effectiveness.

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级光谱视觉变换器（LoLA-SpecViT），通过参数高效架构解决高光谱图像分类中的高维度和标签稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像分类面临高维度、频带冗余和标签稀缺的挑战，现有变换器模型在可扩展性和适应性上有限。

Method: 结合3D卷积光谱前端和局部窗口自注意力，集成低秩适应（LoRA）以减少可训练参数，并使用循环学习率调度器。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上表现优异，最高准确率达99.91%，参数更少且低标签条件下鲁棒性更强。

Conclusion: LoLA-SpecViT为高光谱图像应用提供了可扩展和通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image classification remains a challenging task due to the high
dimensionality of spectral data, significant inter-band redundancy, and the
limited availability of annotated samples. While recent transformer-based
models have improved the global modeling of spectral-spatial dependencies,
their scalability and adaptability under label-scarce conditions remain
limited. In this work, we propose \textbf{LoLA-SpecViT}(Low-rank adaptation
Local Attention Spectral Vision Transformer), a lightweight spectral vision
transformer that addresses these limitations through a parameter-efficient
architecture tailored to the unique characteristics of hyperspectral imagery.
Our model combines a 3D convolutional spectral front-end with local
window-based self-attention, enhancing both spectral feature extraction and
spatial consistency while reducing computational complexity. To further improve
adaptability, we integrate low-rank adaptation (LoRA) into attention and
projection layers, enabling fine-tuning with over 80\% fewer trainable
parameters. A novel cyclical learning rate scheduler modulates LoRA adaptation
strength during training, improving convergence and generalisation. Extensive
experiments on three benchmark datasets WHU-Hi LongKou, WHU-Hi HongHu, and
Salinas demonstrate that LoLA-SpecViT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, achieving up to 99.91\% accuracy with substantially fewer parameters
and enhanced robustness under low-label regimes. The proposed framework
provides a scalable and generalizable solution for real-world HSI applications
in agriculture, environmental monitoring, and remote sensing analytics. Our
code is available in the following

TL;DR: FairMoE框架通过动态路由数据到最合适的专家模块，在保持公平性的同时提高了皮肤疾病诊断的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI系统在皮肤疾病诊断中存在跨人口群体的偏见，导致不公平的医疗结果和患者信任度下降。传统方法试图消除敏感属性与预测的关联，但会损失临床相关诊断线索。

Method: 提出FairMoE框架，采用分层混合专家模块作为群体特定学习器，动态路由数据而非硬性分配。

Result: 实验显示FairMoE在保持公平性指标的同时显著提升了准确性，优于传统方法。

Conclusion: FairMoE通过动态路由机制有效解决了偏见问题，同时提升了诊断性能。

Abstract: AI-based systems have achieved high accuracy in skin disease diagnostics but
often exhibit biases across demographic groups, leading to inequitable
healthcare outcomes and diminished patient trust. Most existing bias mitigation
methods attempt to eliminate the correlation between sensitive attributes and
diagnostic prediction, but those methods often degrade performance due to the
lost of clinically relevant diagnostic cues. In this work, we propose an
alternative approach that incorporates sensitive attributes to achieve
fairness. We introduce FairMoE, a framework that employs layer-wise
mixture-of-experts modules to serve as group-specific learners. Unlike
traditional methods that rigidly assign data based on group labels, FairMoE
dynamically routes data to the most suitable expert, making it particularly
effective for handling cases near group boundaries. Experimental results show
that, unlike previous fairness approaches that reduce performance, FairMoE
achieves substantial accuracy improvements while preserving comparable fairness
metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Temporal提出了一种基于时间对比自监督学习的视觉ICL方法，将ICL重新定义为视频对象分割任务，显著提升了图像和视频分割的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流ICL方法依赖网格策略，缺乏视觉应用的灵活性，限制了上下文图像的数量和分辨率。

Method: 通过时间对比自监督目标预训练提示检索器，将ICL作为视频对象分割任务处理，支持可变数量的上下文图像并保持其分辨率。

Result: 在MICCAI FLARE 2022上，图像分割Dice分数提升10.64%（90.95%），视频分割提升14.88%（92.45%）。

Conclusion: Temporal通过重新定义ICL任务和自监督学习，显著提升了视觉应用的性能。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables generalization to new tasks with minimal
labeled data. However, mainstream ICL approaches rely on a gridding strategy,
which lacks the flexibility required for vision applications. We introduce
Temporal, a time-contrastive self-supervised objective that pretrains a prompt
retriever for visual ICL, and formulate ICL as a video object segmentation
(VOS) task. Temporal addresses key limitations of grid-based methods that
restrict the number and resolution of context images. By reframing ICL as a VOS
problem, our approach supports a variable number of context images while
preserving their full resolution. To address the challenge of selecting optimal
context sets for queries, we pretrain a prompt retriever on videos via
self-supervised learning, where adjacent frames serve as positives and distant
frames as negatives. For image segmentation, the prompt retriever selects
relevant sequences that, when combined with the query, form coherent videos for
VOS processing. For video segmentation, it identifies keyframes, predicts their
masks using our ICL pipeline, and propagates them throughout the sequence. When
evaluated on MICCAI FLARE 2022, our method achieves substantial improvements
over baselines: 90.95% Dice score for image segmentation (10.64% improvement)
and 92.45% Dice for video segmentation (14.88% improvement).

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于卷积稀疏表示（CSR）的前景-背景分离（FBS）方法，用于处理低帧率和多噪声视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有FBS方法无法准确分离低质量视频中的前景和背景，因为它们仅捕捉特定或通用特征，且未明确建模多种噪声。

Method: 提出了一种基于CSR的前景模型，通过多凸优化问题结合CSR、通用特征函数和噪声表征函数，开发了交替求解算法。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在红外和显微镜视频中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效分离前景和背景，并处理多种噪声和低帧率问题。

Abstract: This paper proposes a foreground-background separation (FBS) method with a
novel foreground model based on convolutional sparse representation (CSR). In
order to analyze the dynamic and static components of videos acquired under
undesirable conditions, such as hardware, environmental, and power limitations,
it is essential to establish an FBS method that can handle videos with low
frame rates and various types of noise. Existing FBS methods have two
limitations that prevent us from accurately separating foreground and
background components from such degraded videos. First, they only capture
either data-specific or general features of the components. Second, they do not
include explicit models for various types of noise to remove them in the FBS
process. To this end, we propose a robust FBS method with a CSR-based
foreground model. This model can adaptively capture specific spatial structures
scattered in imaging data. Then, we formulate FBS as a constrained multiconvex
optimization problem that incorporates CSR, functions that capture general
features, and explicit noise characterization functions for multiple types of
noise. Thanks to these functions, our method captures both data-specific and
general features to accurately separate the components from various types of
noise even under low frame rates. To obtain a solution of the optimization
problem, we develop an algorithm that alternately solves its two convex
subproblems by newly established algorithms. Experiments demonstrate the
superiority of our method over existing methods using two types of degraded
videos: infrared and microscope videos.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于SMPL的3D胎儿统计身体模型，用于改进胎儿MRI分析中的形状和运动捕捉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（关键点或体分割）在胎儿MRI分析中存在局限性，无法同时兼顾运动分析和形状细节。

Method: 构建3D胎儿统计身体模型，迭代估计图像空间中的姿态和规范姿态空间中的形状。

Result: 模型在未见过的胎儿形状上实现了3.2 mm的表面对齐误差，支持自动人体测量。

Conclusion: 该模型为胎儿运动和形状分析提供了新工具，推动了产前诊断的发展。

Abstract: Analyzing fetal body motion and shape is paramount in prenatal diagnostics
and monitoring. Existing methods for fetal MRI analysis mainly rely on
anatomical keypoints or volumetric body segmentations. Keypoints simplify body
structure to facilitate motion analysis, but may ignore important details of
full-body shape. Body segmentations capture complete shape information but
complicate temporal analysis due to large non-local fetal movements. To address
these limitations, we construct a 3D articulated statistical fetal body model
based on the Skinned Multi-Person Linear Model (SMPL). Our algorithm
iteratively estimates body pose in the image space and body shape in the
canonical pose space. This approach improves robustness to MRI motion artifacts
and intensity distortions, and reduces the impact of incomplete surface
observations due to challenging fetal poses. We train our model on
segmentations and keypoints derived from $19,816$ MRI volumes across $53$
subjects. Our model captures body shape and motion across time series and
provides intuitive visualization. Furthermore, it enables automated
anthropometric measurements traditionally difficult to obtain from
segmentations and keypoints. When tested on unseen fetal body shapes, our
method yields a surface alignment error of $3.2$ mm for $3$ mm MRI voxel size.
To our knowledge, this represents the first 3D articulated statistical fetal
body model, paving the way for enhanced fetal motion and shape analysis in
prenatal diagnostics. The code is available at

TL;DR: CM-SSM是一种高效的RGB-热语义分割架构，通过跨模态状态空间建模（SSM）方法，显著降低了计算开销，同时保持了高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在野外环境中，RGB和热数据的融合可以显著提升语义分割性能，但现有方法（如基于Transformer的方法）计算开销大，难以在资源受限系统中应用。

Method: 提出了CM-SSM架构，包含两个关键模块：跨模态2D选择性扫描（CM-SS2D）和跨模态状态空间关联（CM-SSA），分别用于建立跨模态状态空间模型和整合全局与局部特征。

Result: 在CART和PST900数据集上，CM-SSM以更少的参数和更低的计算成本实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: CM-SSM通过线性计算复杂度和高效设计，为资源受限系统提供了一种可行的RGB-热语义分割解决方案。

Abstract: The integration of RGB and thermal data can significantly improve semantic
segmentation performance in wild environments for field robots. Nevertheless,
multi-source data processing (e.g. Transformer-based approaches) imposes
significant computational overhead, presenting challenges for
resource-constrained systems. To resolve this critical limitation, we
introduced CM-SSM, an efficient RGB-thermal semantic segmentation architecture
leveraging a cross-modal state space modeling (SSM) approach. Our framework
comprises two key components. First, we introduced a cross-modal
2D-selective-scan (CM-SS2D) module to establish SSM between RGB and thermal
modalities, which constructs cross-modal visual sequences and derives hidden
state representations of one modality from the other. Second, we developed a
cross-modal state space association (CM-SSA) module that effectively integrates
global associations from CM-SS2D with local spatial features extracted through
convolutional operations. In contrast with Transformer-based approaches, CM-SSM
achieves linear computational complexity with respect to image resolution.
Experimental results show that CM-SSM achieves state-of-the-art performance on
the CART dataset with fewer parameters and lower computational cost. Further
experiments on the PST900 dataset demonstrate its generalizability. Codes are
available at https://github.com/xiaodonguo/CMSSM.

Conclusion: SurgVidLM填补了精细手术视频理解领域的空白，展示了其在复杂手术场景中的优越性。

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models have demonstrated great
potential in the medical domain, facilitating users to understand surgical
scenes and procedures. Beyond image-based methods, the exploration of Video
Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs) has emerged as a promising avenue for
capturing the complex sequences of information involved in surgery. However,
there is still a lack of Vid-LLMs specialized for fine-grained surgical video
understanding tasks, which is crucial for analyzing specific processes or
details within a surgical procedure. To bridge this gap, we propose SurgVidLM,
the first video language model designed to address both full and fine-grained
surgical video comprehension. To train our SurgVidLM, we construct the SVU-31K
dataset which consists of over 31K video-instruction pairs, enabling both
holistic understanding and detailed analysis of surgical procedures.
Furthermore, we introduce the StageFocus mechanism which is a two-stage
framework performing the multi-grained, progressive understanding of surgical
videos. We also develop the Multi-frequency Fusion Attention to effectively
integrate low and high-frequency visual tokens, ensuring the retention of
critical information. Experimental results demonstrate that SurgVidLM
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art Vid-LLMs in both full and
fine-grained video understanding tasks, showcasing its superior capability in
capturing complex procedural contexts.

Conclusion: StainPIDR能够有效解决病理图像的颜色差异问题，代码将公开。

Abstract: The color appearance of a pathological image is highly related to the imaging
protocols, the proportion of different dyes, and the scanning devices.
Computer-aided diagnostic systems may deteriorate when facing these
color-variant pathological images. In this work, we propose a stain
normalization method called StainPIDR. We try to eliminate this color
discrepancy by decoupling the image into structure features and
vector-quantized color features, restaining the structure features with the
target color features, and decoding the stained structure features to
normalized pathological images. We assume that color features decoupled by
different images with the same color should be exactly the same. Under this
assumption, we train a fixed color vector codebook to which the decoupled color
features will map. In the restaining part, we utilize the cross-attention
mechanism to efficiently stain the structure features. As the target color
(decoupled from a selected template image) will also affect the performance of
stain normalization, we further design a template image selection algorithm to
select a template from a given dataset. In our extensive experiments, we
validate the effectiveness of StainPIDR and the template image selection
algorithm. All the results show that our method can perform well in the stain
normalization task. The code of StainPIDR will be publicly available later.

Furthermore, a cloud-aware model update strategy introduces adaptive loss
weighting to prioritize cloud-occluded regions, enhancing reconstruction
accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
existing approaches, achieving a PSNR of 31.01 dB, SSIM of 0.918, and MAE of

Method: 提出自适应超点聚合模块和对比学习引导的超点细化模块，改进场景特征表示；引入关系感知自注意力机制，增强查询特征间的关系建模。

Result: 在ScanNetV2、ScanNet++、ScanNet200和S3DIS数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: Relation3D通过改进关系建模，显著提升了3D实例分割的性能。

Abstract: 3D instance segmentation aims to predict a set of object instances in a
scene, representing them as binary foreground masks with corresponding semantic
labels. Currently, transformer-based methods are gaining increasing attention
due to their elegant pipelines and superior predictions. However, these methods
primarily focus on modeling the external relationships between scene features
and query features through mask attention. They lack effective modeling of the
internal relationships among scene features as well as between query features.
In light of these disadvantages, we propose \textbf{Relation3D: Enhancing
Relation Modeling for Point Cloud Instance Segmentation}. Specifically, we
introduce an adaptive superpoint aggregation module and a contrastive
learning-guided superpoint refinement module to better represent superpoint
features (scene features) and leverage contrastive learning to guide the
updates of these features. Furthermore, our relation-aware self-attention
mechanism enhances the capabilities of modeling relationships between queries
by incorporating positional and geometric relationships into the self-attention
mechanism. Extensive experiments on the ScanNetV2, ScanNet++, ScanNet200 and
S3DIS datasets demonstrate the superior performance of Relation3D.

Abstract: Conveyor belt is a category of important equipments in modern industry,
widely applied in production and manufacturing Fields. Its health status is
much critical to operation efficiency and safety hazards. Among the factors
affecting belt health, crack is often one of the most threatening risks.
Currently, considering safety, how to intelligently detect belt cracks is
catching an increasing attention. To implement the intelligent detection with
machine learning, real crack samples are believed to be necessary. However,
existing crack datasets primarily focus on pavement scenarios or synthetic
data, no real-world industrial belt crack datasets at all. To propel machine
learning advancement in this field, this paper constructs the first
sequential-image belt crack detection datasets (BeltCrack14ks and
BeltCrack9kd), from real-world factory scenes. Furthermore, to validate
usability and effectiveness, we propose a special baseline method with
triple-domain (i.e., time-space-frequency) feature hierarchical fusion learning
for the two whole-new datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the
availability and effectiveness of our dataset. Besides, they also show that our
baseline is obviously superior to other similar detection methods. Our datasets

Motivation: 内中心视觉对AR、VR和机器人应用至关重要，但现有方法依赖2D线索和多视角同步，且假设不现实。

Method: EgoWorld通过外中心深度图重建点云，重投影到内中心视角，再使用扩散修复生成语义连贯的图像。

Result: 在H2O和TACO数据集上表现优异，泛化能力强，对未标注真实数据也有效。

Conclusion: EgoWorld为内中心视觉重建提供了高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Egocentric vision is essential for both human and machine visual
understanding, particularly in capturing the detailed hand-object interactions
needed for manipulation tasks. Translating third-person views into first-person
views significantly benefits augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and
robotics applications. However, current exocentric-to-egocentric translation
methods are limited by their dependence on 2D cues, synchronized multi-view
settings, and unrealistic assumptions such as necessity of initial egocentric
frame and relative camera poses during inference. To overcome these challenges,
we introduce EgoWorld, a novel two-stage framework that reconstructs an
egocentric view from rich exocentric observations, including projected point
clouds, 3D hand poses, and textual descriptions. Our approach reconstructs a
point cloud from estimated exocentric depth maps, reprojects it into the
egocentric perspective, and then applies diffusion-based inpainting to produce
dense, semantically coherent egocentric images. Evaluated on the H2O and TACO
datasets, EgoWorld achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates
robust generalization to new objects, actions, scenes, and subjects. Moreover,
EgoWorld shows promising results even on unlabeled real-world examples.

Motivation: 解决MLLMs因语言先验导致的虚假相关性和视觉信息利用不足问题。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著提升了细粒度视觉理解和幻觉抑制能力。

Conclusion: 该框架有效提升了MLLMs的视觉理解能力并减少了幻觉问题。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language tasks, such
as image captioning and visual question answering. However, they often suffer
from over-reliance on spurious correlations, primarily due to linguistic priors
that distract the model from leveraging actual visual information. To address
these issues, we introduce MMGrounded-PostAlign, a post-multimodal alignment
framework designed to enhance the visual understanding capabilities and
mitigate the hallucinations of MLLMs. Our framework incorporates a multimodal
grounding module for both visual grounding, which identifies the referred
object in the image, and textual grounding, which generates the rationale for
the final answer, ensuring that outputs are anchored in both visual and textual
evidence. To mitigate the hallucinations, we introduce a negative rejection
mechanism in the visual grounding module to distinguish grounded entities from
non-existent objects influenced by linguistic biases. On the textual grounding
side, we propose a selective reasoning mechanism that adjusts the model's
reasoning strategy based on query complexity. Extensive evaluations are
conducted on benchmarks such as POPE, HaloQuest, VQAv2, MME, and MMBench
showing significant improvements in fine-grained visual understanding and
hallucination suppression.

language biases, where spurious correlations between question types and answer
categories are inadvertently established. To address these issues, we propose a
novel Cause-Effect Driven Optimization framework called CEDO, that incorporates
three well-established mechanisms, i.e., Modality-driven Heterogeneous
Optimization (MHO), Gradient-guided Modality Synergy (GMS), and
Distribution-adapted Loss Rescaling (DLR), for comprehensively mitigating
language biases from both causal and effectual perspectives. Specifically, MHO
employs adaptive learning rates for specific modalities to achieve
heterogeneous optimization, thus enhancing robust reasoning capabilities.
Additionally, GMS leverages the Pareto optimization method to foster
synergistic interactions between modalities and enforce gradient orthogonality
to eliminate bias updates, thereby mitigating language biases from the effect
side, i.e., shortcut bias. Furthermore, DLR is designed to assign adaptive
weights to individual losses to ensure balanced learning across all answer
categories, effectively alleviating language biases from the cause side, i.e.,
imbalance biases within datasets. Extensive experiments on multiple traditional
and bias-sensitive benchmarks consistently demonstrate the robustness of CEDO
over state-of-the-art competitors.

Abstract: 2D cameras are often used in interactive systems. Other systems like gaming
consoles provide more powerful 3D cameras for short range depth sensing.
Overall, these cameras are not reliable in large, complex environments. In this
work, we propose a 3D stereo vision based pipeline for interactive systems,
that is able to handle both ordinary and sensitive applications, through robust
scene understanding. We explore the fusion of multiple 3D cameras to do full
scene reconstruction, which allows for preforming a wide range of tasks, like
event recognition, subject tracking, and notification. Using possible feedback
approaches, the system can receive data from the subjects present in the
environment, to learn to make better decisions, or to adapt to completely new
environments. Throughout the paper, we introduce the pipeline and explain our
preliminary experimentation and results. Finally, we draw the roadmap for the
next steps that need to be taken, in order to get this pipeline into production

TL;DR: PlanMoGPT通过渐进式规划和流增强的细粒度运动标记化，解决了LLM在文本到运动生成中的性能瓶颈，显著提升了生成质量和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM方法在文本到运动生成中表现不佳，主要由于运动标记化的粒度问题：细粒度标记化导致局部依赖问题，而粗粒度标记化牺牲了运动细节。

Method: 提出PlanMoGPT框架，结合渐进式规划和流增强的细粒度运动标记化。渐进式规划分层生成运动标记，流增强标记化减少细节损失。

Result: 在文本到运动基准测试中，FID分数提升63.8%，运动多样性提升49.9%，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: PlanMoGPT成功解决了多样性-质量的权衡问题，为文本到运动生成设定了新标准。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled breakthroughs in
many multimodal generation tasks, but a significant performance gap still
exists in text-to-motion generation, where LLM-based methods lag far behind
non-LLM methods. We identify the granularity of motion tokenization as a
critical bottleneck: fine-grained tokenization induces local dependency issues,
where LLMs overemphasize short-term coherence at the expense of global semantic
alignment, while coarse-grained tokenization sacrifices motion details. To
resolve this issue, we propose PlanMoGPT, an LLM-based framework integrating
progressive planning and flow-enhanced fine-grained motion tokenization. First,
our progressive planning mechanism leverages LLMs' autoregressive capabilities
to hierarchically generate motion tokens by starting from sparse global plans
and iteratively refining them into full sequences. Second, our flow-enhanced
tokenizer doubles the downsampling resolution and expands the codebook size by
eight times, minimizing detail loss during discretization, while a
flow-enhanced decoder recovers motion nuances. Extensive experiments on
text-to-motion benchmarks demonstrate that it achieves state-of-the-art
performance, improving FID scores by 63.8% (from 0.380 to 0.141) on
long-sequence generation while enhancing motion diversity by 49.9% compared to
existing methods. The proposed framework successfully resolves the
diversity-quality trade-off that plagues current non-LLM approaches,
establishing new standards for text-to-motion generation.

Result: 在Office-Home、Office-31和VisDA-2017数据集上优于现有CNN方法，DomainNet上表现相当。

Conclusion: 提出的UDA方法在多模态分布对齐和训练效率上表现优异，适用于自然图像的跨域分类任务。

Abstract: We present a novel approach for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for
natural images. A commonly-used objective for UDA schemes is to enhance domain
alignment in representation space even if there is a domain shift in the input
space. Existing adversarial domain adaptation methods may not effectively align
different domains of multimodal distributions associated with classification
problems. Our approach has two main features. Firstly, its neural architecture
uses the deep structure of ResNet and the effective separation of scales of
feature pyramidal network (FPN) to work with both content and style features.
Secondly, it uses a combination of a novel loss function and judiciously
selected existing loss functions to train the network architecture. This
tailored combination is designed to address challenges inherent to natural
images, such as scale, noise, and style shifts, that occur on top of a
multi-modal (multi-class) distribution. The combined loss function not only
enhances model accuracy and robustness on the target domain but also speeds up
training convergence. Our proposed UDA scheme generalizes better than
state-of-the-art for CNN-based methods on Office-Home, Office-31, and
VisDA-2017 datasets and comaparable for DomainNet dataset.

Abstract: Medical visual question answering aims to support clinical decision-making by
enabling models to answer natural language questions based on medical images.
While recent advances in multi-modal learning have significantly improved
performance, current methods still suffer from limited answer reliability and
poor interpretability, impairing the ability of clinicians and patients to
understand and trust model-generated answers. To address this, this work first
proposes a Thinking with Visual Grounding (ThinkVG) dataset wherein the answer
generation is decomposed into intermediate reasoning steps that explicitly
ground relevant visual regions of the medical image, thereby providing
fine-grained explainability. Furthermore, we introduce a novel verifiable
reward mechanism for reinforcement learning to guide post-training, improving
the alignment between the model's reasoning process and its final answer.
Remarkably, our method achieves comparable performance using only one-eighth of
the training data, demonstrating the efficiency and effectiveness of the
proposal. The dataset is available at

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection is widely used in a variety of fields such as
urban planning, terrain and geomorphology analysis, and environmental
monitoring, mainly by analyzing the significant change differences of features
(e.g., building changes) in the same spatial region at different time phases.
In this paper, we propose a large language model (LLM) augmented inference
approach (SegChange-R1), which enhances the detection capability by integrating
textual descriptive information and aims at guiding the model to segment the
more interested change regions, thus accelerating the convergence speed.
Moreover, we design a spatial transformation module (BEV) based on linear
attention, which solves the problem of modal misalignment in change detection
by unifying features from different temporal perspectives onto the BEV space.
In addition, we construct the first dataset for building change detection from
UAV viewpoints (DVCD ), and our experiments on four widely-used change
detection datasets show a significant improvement over existing methods. The

Motivation: 街头集市是许多地区的重要经济中心，但其非结构化特性使得帐篷等市场基础设施的自动分类具有挑战性。传统手动方法效率低下，而CNN在此类任务中的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 研究基于126张原始照片及其增强图像的数据集，训练了自定义CNN和EfficientNetB0模型，并使用多种性能指标（如准确率、精确率、召回率、F1分数和mAP）进行比较分析。

Result: 自定义CNN的准确率为92.8%，而EfficientNetB0达到98.4%，验证了迁移学习在集市图像分类中的有效性。混淆矩阵分析揭示了各模型的优缺点。

Conclusion: 使用预训练模型（如EfficientNetB0）可显著提升分类准确性和泛化能力，为集市基础设施的自动化管理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This research paper proposes an improved deep learning model for classifying
tents in street bazaars, comparing a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
with EfficientNetB0. This is a critical task for market organization with a
tent classification, but manual methods in the past have been inefficient.
Street bazaars represent a vital economic hub in many regions, yet their
unstructured nature poses significant challenges for the automated
classification of market infrastructure, such as tents. In Kyrgyzstan, more
than a quarter of the country's GDP is derived from bazaars. While CNNs have
been widely applied to object recognition, their application to bazaar-specific
tasks remains underexplored. Here, we build upon our original approach by
training on an extended set of 126 original photographs that were augmented to
generate additional images. This dataset is publicly available for download on
Kaggle. A variety of performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall,
F1 score, and mean average precision (mAP), were used to assess the models
comparatively, providing a more extensive analysis of classification
performance.
  The results show that the CNN custom model achieved 92.8% accuracy, and
EfficientNetB0 showed 98.4% accuracy results, confirming the effectiveness of
transfer learning in the bazaar image classification. Also, when analyzing the
confusion matrix, the analysis reveals the weaknesses and strengths of each
model. These findings suggest that using a pre-trained model such as
EfficientNetB0 significantly improves classification accuracy and
generalization.

Abstract: This paper presents a newly developed mobile application designed to diagnose
Latent Tuberculosis Infection (LTBI) using the Mantoux Skin Test (TST).
Traditional TST methods often suffer from low follow-up return rates, patient
discomfort, and subjective manual interpretation, particularly with the
ball-point pen method, leading to misdiagnosis and delayed treatment. Moreover,
previous developed mobile applications that used 3D reconstruction, this app
utilizes scaling stickers as reference objects for induration measurement. This
mobile application integrates advanced image processing technologies, including
ARCore, and machine learning algorithms such as DeepLabv3 for robust image
segmentation and precise measurement of skin indurations indicative of LTBI.
The system employs an edge detection algorithm to enhance accuracy. The
application was evaluated against standard clinical practices, demonstrating
significant improvements in accuracy and reliability. This innovation is
crucial for effective tuberculosis management, especially in resource-limited
regions. By automating and standardizing TST evaluations, the application
enhances the accessibility and efficiency of TB di-agnostics. Future work will
focus on refining machine learning models, optimizing measurement algorithms,
expanding functionalities to include comprehensive patient data management, and
enhancing ARCore's performance across various lighting conditions and
operational settings.

Motivation: LiDAR和4D雷达在自动驾驶中各有优势，但融合时存在模态不对齐问题，需解决以提升感知能力。

Method: 通过动态运动感知编码模块提取4D雷达的运动信息，并利用实例级不确定性减少跨模态不对齐，优化LiDAR预测。

Result: 在VoD数据集中，整个区域mAP达74.89%，驾驶走廊内达88.70%，实时推理速度为30.02 FPS。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了跨模态不对齐问题，显著提升了LiDAR检测性能。

Abstract: LiDAR and 4D radar are widely used in autonomous driving and robotics. While
LiDAR provides rich spatial information, 4D radar offers velocity measurement
and remains robust under adverse conditions. As a result, increasing studies
have focused on the 4D radar-LiDAR fusion method to enhance the perception.
However, the misalignment between different modalities is often overlooked. To
address this challenge and leverage the strengths of both modalities, we
propose a LiDAR detection framework enhanced by 4D radar motion status and
cross-modal uncertainty. The object movement information from 4D radar is first
captured using a Dynamic Motion-Aware Encoding module during feature extraction
to enhance 4D radar predictions. Subsequently, the instance-wise uncertainties
of bounding boxes are estimated to mitigate the cross-modal misalignment and
refine the final LiDAR predictions. Extensive experiments on the View-of-Delft
(VoD) dataset highlight the effectiveness of our method, achieving
state-of-the-art performance with the mAP of 74.89% in the entire area and
88.70% within the driving corridor while maintaining a real-time inference
speed of 30.02 FPS.

Result: 在多个FR和NR IQA基准测试中表现优异，且鲁棒性更强。

Conclusion: BPCLIP通过结合语言和多尺度特征，显著提升了图像质量评估的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) aims to evaluate the perceptual quality of
images based on human subjective perception. Existing methods generally combine
multiscale features to achieve high performance, but most rely on
straightforward linear fusion of these features, which may not adequately
capture the impact of distortions on semantic content. To address this, we
propose a bottom-up image quality assessment approach based on the Contrastive
Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP, a recently proposed model that aligns images
and text in a shared feature space), named BPCLIP, which progressively extracts
the impact of low-level distortions on high-level semantics. Specifically, we
utilize an encoder to extract multiscale features from the input image and
introduce a bottom-up multiscale cross attention module designed to capture the
relationships between shallow and deep features. In addition, by incorporating
40 image quality adjectives across six distinct dimensions, we enable the
pre-trained CLIP text encoder to generate representations of the intrinsic
quality of the image, thereby strengthening the connection between image
quality perception and human language. Our method achieves superior results on
most public Full-Reference (FR) and No-Reference (NR) IQA benchmarks, while
demonstrating greater robustness.

Result: 该方法生成的合成数据性能接近真实数据（差距1%以内），显著优于不保障隐私的现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过最大化多样性实现隐私保护，同时提升合成数据的性能，为医学影像数据共享提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Synthetic data has recently reached a level of visual fidelity that makes it
nearly indistinguishable from real data, offering great promise for
privacy-preserving data sharing in medical imaging. However, fully synthetic
datasets still suffer from significant limitations: First and foremost, the
legal aspect of sharing synthetic data is often neglected and data regulations,
such as the GDPR, are largley ignored. Secondly, synthetic models fall short of
matching the performance of real data, even for in-domain downstream
applications. Recent methods for image generation have focused on maximising
image diversity instead of fidelity solely to improve the mode coverage and
therefore the downstream performance of synthetic data. In this work, we shift
perspective and highlight how maximizing diversity can also be interpreted as
protecting natural persons from being singled out, which leads to predicate
singling-out (PSO) secure synthetic datasets. Specifically, we propose a
generalisable framework for training diffusion models on personal data which
leads to unpersonal synthetic datasets achieving performance within one
percentage point of real-data models while significantly outperforming
state-of-the-art methods that do not ensure privacy. Our code is available at

Conclusion: OSDMamba通过结合Mamba的机制和优化设计，显著提升了石油泄漏检测的准确性，尤其在处理小目标和类别不平衡方面表现优异。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is commonly used for Oil Spill Detection (OSD) in
remote sensing images. However, the limited availability of labelled oil spill
samples and class imbalance present significant challenges that can reduce
detection accuracy. Furthermore, most existing methods, which rely on
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), struggle to detect small oil spill areas
due to their limited receptive fields and inability to effectively capture
global contextual information. This study explores the potential of State-Space
Models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, to overcome these limitations, building on
their recent success in vision applications. We propose OSDMamba, the first
Mamba-based architecture specifically designed for oil spill detection.
OSDMamba leverages Mamba's selective scanning mechanism to effectively expand
the model's receptive field while preserving critical details. Moreover, we
designed an asymmetric decoder incorporating ConvSSM and deep supervision to
strengthen multi-scale feature fusion, thereby enhancing the model's
sensitivity to minority class samples. Experimental results show that the
proposed OSDMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding improvements
of 8.9% and 11.8% in OSD across two publicly available datasets.

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection has seen substantial advances in
recent years. However, existing works focus on the standard setting with ideal
images and natural distribution, far from practical scenarios with inevitable
distribution shifts. This hampers the practical applicability of HOI detection.
In this work, we investigate this issue by benchmarking, analyzing, and
enhancing the robustness of HOI detection models under various distribution
shifts. We start by proposing a novel automated approach to create the first
robustness evaluation benchmark for HOI detection. Subsequently, we evaluate
more than 40 existing HOI detection models on this benchmark, showing their
insufficiency, analyzing the features of different frameworks, and discussing
how the robustness in HOI is different from other tasks. With the insights from
such analyses, we propose to improve the robustness of HOI detection methods
through: (1) a cross-domain data augmentation integrated with mixup, and (2) a
feature fusion strategy with frozen vision foundation models. Both are simple,
plug-and-play, and applicable to various methods. Our experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly increases the robustness
of various methods, with benefits on standard benchmarks, too. The dataset and
code will be released.

Abstract: This report introduces PP-DocBee2, an advanced version of the PP-DocBee,
designed to enhance multimodal document understanding. Built on a large
multimodal model architecture, PP-DocBee2 addresses the limitations of its
predecessor through key technological improvements, including enhanced
synthetic data quality, improved visual feature fusion strategy, and optimized

data quality optimization strategy for multimodal document tasks. By employing
a large-scale multimodal pre-trained model to evaluate data, we apply a novel
statistical criterion to filter outliers, ensuring high-quality training data.
Inspired by insights into underutilized intermediate features in multimodal

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) has shown significant promise in
histopathology whole slide image (WSI) analysis for cancer diagnosis and
prognosis. However, the inherent spatial heterogeneity of WSIs presents
critical challenges, as morphologically similar tissue types are often
dispersed across distant anatomical regions. Conventional MIL methods struggle
to model these scattered tissue distributions and capture cross-regional
spatial interactions effectively. To address these limitations, we propose a
novel Multiple instance learning framework with Context-Aware Clustering
(MiCo), designed to enhance cross-regional intra-tissue correlations and
strengthen inter-tissue semantic associations in WSIs. MiCo begins by
clustering instances to distill discriminative morphological patterns, with
cluster centroids serving as semantic anchors. To enhance cross-regional
intra-tissue correlations, MiCo employs a Cluster Route module, which
dynamically links instances of the same tissue type across distant regions via
feature similarity. These semantic anchors act as contextual hubs, propagating
semantic relationships to refine instance-level representations. To eliminate
semantic fragmentation and strengthen inter-tissue semantic associations, MiCo
integrates a Cluster Reducer module, which consolidates redundant anchors while
enhancing information exchange between distinct semantic groups. Extensive
experiments on two challenging tasks across nine large-scale public cancer
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MiCo, showcasing its superiority over
state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合预训练冻结LLM层的混合结构（LLM4Seg），用于医学图像分割任务，显著提升了性能且参数增量极小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索预训练大语言模型（LLM）的语义理解能力是否可用于提升医学图像分割任务的效果。

Method: 设计了一种混合结构，将预训练且冻结的LLM层集成到CNN编码器-解码器分割框架中。

Result: 该设计在多种医学图像模态（如超声、皮肤镜、息肉镜和CT扫描）中均提升了分割性能，且对可训练参数的增加极小。

Conclusion: 研究表明，LLM的语义理解能力可以迁移到图像分割任务中，提升全局理解和局部建模能力，且对不同LLM（如LLaMA和DeepSeek）均有效。

Abstract: With the advancement of Large Language Model (LLM) for natural language
processing, this paper presents an intriguing finding: a frozen pre-trained LLM
layer can process visual tokens for medical image segmentation tasks.
Specifically, we propose a simple hybrid structure that integrates a
pre-trained, frozen LLM layer within the CNN encoder-decoder segmentation
framework (LLM4Seg). Surprisingly, this design improves segmentation
performance with a minimal increase in trainable parameters across various
modalities, including ultrasound, dermoscopy, polypscopy, and CT scans. Our
in-depth analysis reveals the potential of transferring LLM's semantic
awareness to enhance segmentation tasks, offering both improved global
understanding and better local modeling capabilities. The improvement proves
robust across different LLMs, validated using LLaMA and DeepSeek.

TL;DR: CmFNet是一种新型的3D弱监督跨模态医学图像分割方法，通过结合多模态信息和混合监督策略，显著提升了分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量密集标注成本高且耗时，弱监督学习虽高效但面临性能下降和过拟合问题，需解决这些挑战。

Method: CmFNet包含模态特定特征学习网络、跨模态特征学习网络和混合监督学习策略，结合多模态信息和多种监督方式。

Result: 在临床NPC数据集和公开WORD数据集上表现优于现有弱监督方法，甚至优于全监督方法。

Conclusion: CmFNet能有效缓解过拟合，提升分割性能，对临床治疗和多学科专家具有重要价值。

Abstract: Accurate automatic medical image segmentation relies on high-quality, dense
annotations, which are costly and time-consuming. Weakly supervised learning
provides a more efficient alternative by leveraging sparse and coarse
annotations instead of dense, precise ones. However, segmentation performance
degradation and overfitting caused by sparse annotations remain key challenges.
To address these issues, we propose CmFNet, a novel 3D weakly supervised
cross-modal medical image segmentation approach. CmFNet consists of three main
components: a modality-specific feature learning network, a cross-modal feature
learning network, and a hybrid-supervised learning strategy. Specifically, the
modality-specific feature learning network and the cross-modal feature learning
network effectively integrate complementary information from multi-modal
images, enhancing shared features across modalities to improve segmentation
performance. Additionally, the hybrid-supervised learning strategy guides
segmentation through scribble supervision, intra-modal regularization, and
inter-modal consistency, modeling spatial and contextual relationships while
promoting feature alignment. Our approach effectively mitigates overfitting,
delivering robust segmentation results. It excels in segmenting both
challenging small tumor regions and common anatomical structures. Extensive
experiments on a clinical cross-modal nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) dataset
(including CT and MR imaging) and the publicly available CT Whole Abdominal
Organ dataset (WORD) show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art weakly
supervised methods. In addition, our approach also outperforms fully supervised
methods when full annotation is used. Our approach can facilitate clinical
therapy and benefit various specialists, including physicists, radiologists,
pathologists, and oncologists.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种增量训练策略（Incremental Training Strategy），通过四个阶段优化小型视觉语言模型（SVLMs）的推理能力，显著提升了1B参数模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小型视觉语言模型（SVLMs）因参数少导致推理能力受限，但其低成本和低功耗具有高商业价值，因此需要提升其推理能力。

Method: 1. 构建自监督的链式思维（COT）数据；2. 分四个阶段进行增量训练：SFT注入知识、GRPO对齐格式、GRPO增强推理、CLGRPO约束训练空间。

Result: 在EMOSet-118K数据集上，1B SVLM的准确率提升2.77，召回率提升0.69，性能接近8B模型。

Conclusion: 增量训练策略有效提升了SVLMs的推理能力，使其在低成本下达到更高性能。

Abstract: Small Vision Language Models (SVLMs) generally refer to models with parameter
sizes less than or equal to 2B. Their low cost and power consumption
characteristics confer high commercial value. However, their reasoning
abilities are limited by the number of parameters. To address this issue, this
paper proposes a post-training optimization paradigm called the Incremental
Training Strategy to enhance the reasoning ability of SVLMs. Firstly, we
constructed a Self-Supervised Chain-of-Thought (COT) Data Construction System,
which leverages multiple LVLMs with 7B parameters or more to transform original
data into COT data in a self-supervised manner. Our proposed Incremental
Training Strategy consists of four stages. Stage 1 injects domain knowledge by
performing Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to the pretrained model on the COT
data. Stage 2 aligns the COT data format by conducting a small amount of Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) training constrained only by format rewards
on the COT data. Stage 3 enhances reasoning ability by applying GRPO training
on the COT data with constraints on both format and accuracy rewards. The
resulting model shows significant improvement compared to the baseline. Stage 4
addresses the limited capacity of the SVLMs and the weak ability to capture
complex patterns by proposing ClipLow GRPO (CLGRPO) to constrain the capture
space of the training process. We conducted extensive comparative and ablation
experiments on the abstract semantic recognition dataset EMOSet-118K.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the
reasoning ability of 1B SVLM. Compared to the baseline model fine-tuned on the
original data, accuracy increased by 2.77 and recall by 0.69, achieving
performance comparable to that of 8B models.

Motivation: 由于2D图像在田间条件下存在深度信息丢失、投影失真和遮挡等问题，传统方法难以准确估计小麦穗的三维形态特征。

Method: 采用DINOv2（自监督视觉Transformer）和单向LSTM网络的迁移学习管道，结合深度监督学习，提升模型的泛化能力。

Result: 在六视角室内图像上，模型MAPE为6.46%，优于传统方法（9.36%和13.98%）；在单图像田间数据上，MAPE为10.82%。

Conclusion: 深度学习模型在复杂几何形状（如小麦穗）的体积估计中表现优于传统几何方法，形状对预测精度有显著影响。

Abstract: Estimating three-dimensional morphological traits from two-dimensional RGB
images presents inherent challenges due to the loss of depth information,
projection distortions, and occlusions under field conditions. In this work, we
explore multiple approaches for non-destructive volume estimation of wheat
spikes, using RGB image sequences and structured-light 3D scans as ground truth
references. Due to the complex geometry of the spikes, we propose a neural
network approach for volume estimation in 2D images, employing a transfer
learning pipeline that combines DINOv2, a self-supervised Vision Transformer,
with a unidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. By using deep
supervision, the model is able to learn more robust intermediate
representations, which enhances its generalisation ability across varying
evaluation sequences. We benchmark our model against two conventional
baselines: a 2D area-based projection and a geometric reconstruction using
axis-aligned cross-sections. Our deep supervised model achieves a mean absolute
percentage error (MAPE) of 6.46% on six-view indoor images, outperforming the
area (9.36%) and geometric (13.98%) baselines. Fine-tuning the model on
field-based single-image data enables domain adaptation, yielding a MAPE of
10.82%. We demonstrate that object shape significantly impacts volume
prediction accuracy, with irregular geometries such as wheat spikes posing
greater challenges for geometric methods compared to our deep learning
approach.

Abstract: Deep learning-based medical image classification techniques are rapidly
advancing in medical image analysis, making it crucial to develop accurate and
trustworthy models that can be efficiently deployed across diverse clinical
scenarios. Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs), which first predict a set of
explainable concepts from images and then perform classification based on these
concepts, are increasingly being adopted for explainable medical image
classification. However, the inherent explainability of CBMs introduces new
challenges when deploying trained models to new environments. Variations in
imaging protocols and staining methods may induce concept-level shifts, such as
alterations in color distribution and scale. Furthermore, since CBM training
requires explicit concept annotations, fine-tuning models solely with
image-level labels could compromise concept prediction accuracy and
faithfulness - a critical limitation given the high cost of acquiring
expert-annotated concept labels in medical domains. To address these
challenges, we propose a training-free confusion concept identification
strategy. By leveraging minimal new data (e.g., 4 images per class) with only
image-level labels, our approach enhances out-of-domain performance without
sacrificing source domain accuracy through two key operations: masking
misactivated confounding concepts and amplifying under-activated discriminative
concepts. The efficacy of our method is validated on both skin and white blood
cell images. Our code is available at:

Motivation: 现代多模态模型依赖语言先验和虚假相关性，导致定位预测不准确，MUPA旨在解决这一问题。

Method: MUPA采用多路径推理设计，结合定位和问答代理，并通过反思代理聚合结果。

Result: MUPA在2B参数下优于7B规模的竞争对手，7B参数时在NExT-GQA和DeVE-QA上达到30.3%和47.4%的Acc@GQA。

Conclusion: MUPA通过多路径协作设计，实现了更可靠的视频语言理解。

Abstract: Grounded Video Question Answering (Grounded VideoQA) requires aligning
textual answers with explicit visual evidence. However, modern multimodal
models often rely on linguistic priors and spurious correlations, resulting in
poorly grounded predictions. In this work, we propose MUPA, a cooperative
MUlti-Path Agentic approach that unifies video grounding, question answering,
answer reflection and aggregation to tackle Grounded VideoQA. MUPA features
three distinct reasoning paths on the interplay of grounding and QA agents in
different chronological orders, along with a dedicated reflection agent to
judge and aggregate the multi-path results to accomplish consistent QA and
grounding. This design markedly improves grounding fidelity without sacrificing
answer accuracy. Despite using only 2B parameters, our method outperforms all
7B-scale competitors. When scaled to 7B parameters, MUPA establishes new
state-of-the-art results, with Acc@GQA of 30.3% and 47.4% on NExT-GQA and
DeVE-QA respectively, demonstrating MUPA' effectiveness towards trustworthy
video-language understanding. Our code is available in

Result: 在AIDE数据集上实现SOTA准确率，模型轻量（<6M参数），推理速度达142.32 FPS。

Conclusion: TEM^3-Learning框架高效解决了多任务学习中的模态限制和效率问题，适用于实时驾驶辅助系统。

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) can advance assistive driving by exploring
inter-task correlations through shared representations. However, existing
methods face two critical limitations: single-modality constraints limiting
comprehensive scene understanding and inefficient architectures impeding
real-time deployment. This paper proposes TEM^3-Learning (Time-Efficient
Multimodal Multi-task Learning), a novel framework that jointly optimizes
driver emotion recognition, driver behavior recognition, traffic context
recognition, and vehicle behavior recognition through a two-stage architecture.
The first component, the mamba-based multi-view temporal-spatial feature
extraction subnetwork (MTS-Mamba), introduces a forward-backward temporal
scanning mechanism and global-local spatial attention to efficiently extract
low-cost temporal-spatial features from multi-view sequential images. The
second component, the MTL-based gated multimodal feature integrator (MGMI),
employs task-specific multi-gating modules to adaptively highlight the most
relevant modality features for each task, effectively alleviating the negative
transfer problem in MTL. Evaluation on the AIDE dataset, our proposed model
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy across all four tasks, maintaining a
lightweight architecture with fewer than 6 million parameters and delivering an
impressive 142.32 FPS inference speed. Rigorous ablation studies further
validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and the independent
contributions of each module. The code is available on

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal generative models have unlocked photorealistic,
instruction-aligned image generation, yet leading systems like GPT-4o-Image
remain proprietary and inaccessible. To democratize these capabilities, we
present ShareGPT-4o-Image, the first dataset comprising 45K text-to-image and
46K text-and-image-to-image data, all synthesized using GPT-4o's image
generation capabilities for distilling its advanced image generation abilities.
Leveraging this dataset, we develop Janus-4o, a multimodal large language model
capable of both text-to-image and text-and-image-to-image generation. Janus-4o
not only significantly improves text-to-image generation over its predecessor,
Janus-Pro, but also newly supports text-and-image-to-image generation. Notably,
it achieves impressive performance in text-and-image-to-image generation from
scratch, using only 91K synthetic samples and 6 hours of training on an 8
A800-GPU machine. We hope the release of ShareGPT-4o-Image and Janus-4o will
foster open research in photorealistic, instruction-aligned image generation.

TL;DR: 论文分析了VICReg在自监督学习中的潜在不足，提出改进方法SAG-VICReg，通过新训练技术提升泛化能力，实验显示其优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VICReg可能因过度依赖训练数据而泛化能力不足，需改进以生成更鲁棒的图像表示。

Method: 提出SAG-VICReg，结合新训练技术增强全局语义捕捉和泛化能力。

Result: SAG-VICReg在泛化能力和全局语义理解上表现优异，同时保持局部指标竞争力。

Conclusion: SAG-VICReg有效解决泛化问题，并提出无需标签的新评估指标。

Abstract: In this paper, we argue that viewing VICReg-a popular self-supervised
learning (SSL) method--through the lens of spectral embedding reveals a
potential source of sub-optimality: it may struggle to generalize robustly to
unseen data due to overreliance on the training data. This observation invites
a closer look at how well this method achieves its goal of producing meaningful
representations of images outside of the training set as well. Here, we
investigate this issue and introduce SAG-VICReg (Stable and Generalizable
VICReg), a method that builds on VICReg by incorporating new training
techniques. These enhancements improve the model's ability to capture global
semantics within the data and strengthen the generalization capabilities.
Experiments demonstrate that SAG-VICReg effectively addresses the
generalization challenge while matching or surpassing diverse state-of-the-art
SSL baselines. Notably, our method exhibits superior performance on metrics
designed to evaluate global semantic understanding, while simultaneously
maintaining competitive results on local evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we
propose a new standalone evaluation metric for embeddings that complements the
standard evaluation methods and accounts for the global data structure without
requiring labels--a key issue when tagged data is scarce or not available.

Abstract: Polyp detection is crucial for colorectal cancer screening, yet existing
models are limited by the scale and diversity of available data. While
generative models show promise for data augmentation, current methods mainly
focus on enhancing polyp diversity, often overlooking the critical issue of
false positives. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing an adversarial
diffusion framework to synthesize high-value false positives. The extensive
variability of negative backgrounds presents a significant challenge in false
positive synthesis. To overcome this, we introduce two key innovations: First,
we design a regional noise matching strategy to construct a negative synthesis
space using polyp detection datasets. This strategy trains a negative-centric
diffusion model by masking polyp regions, ensuring the model focuses
exclusively on learning diverse background patterns. Second, we introduce the
Detector-guided Adversarial Diffusion Attacker (DADA) module, which perturbs
the negative synthesis process to disrupt a pre-trained detector's decision,
guiding the negative-centric diffusion model to generate high-value,
detector-confusing false positives instead of low-value, ordinary backgrounds.
Our approach is the first to apply adversarial diffusion to lesion detection,
establishing a new paradigm for targeted false positive synthesis and paving
the way for more reliable clinical applications in colorectal cancer screening.
Extensive results on public and in-house datasets verify the superiority of our
method over the current state-of-the-arts, with our synthesized data improving
the detectors by at least 2.6% and 2.7% in F1-score, respectively, over the
baselines. Codes are at https://github.com/Huster-Hq/DADA.

Abstract: Medical imaging diagnosis presents inherent challenges due to diseases that
mimic normal anatomy and exhibit significant inter-patient variability.
Clinicians routinely employ comparative reasoning-using reference images from
healthy controls or previous patient examinations-to discern subtle yet
diagnostically critical abnormalities. However, existing medical
vision-language models (VLMs) focus primarily on single-image or single-series
analyses and lack explicit mechanisms for comparative reasoning. Conversely,
general-purpose VLMs demonstrate strong multi-image comparative reasoning
capabilities but lack essential medical-domain knowledge to identify nuanced
clinical differences. This work aims to bridge this gap by exploring
clinically-inspired comparative analysis within VLMs, leveraging reference
images to enhance diagnostic accuracy. Through extensive empirical analysis, we
show that providing general-purpose VLMs with query and normative matched
reference images, accompanied by clinically-informed comparative prompts,
significantly improves diagnostic outcomes compared to single-image baselines,
especially after supervised finetuning (SFT). Our contributions highlight the
clinical relevance of comparative analysis introduce novel strategies for
leveraging reference images in VLMs, empirically demonstrate enhanced
performance across multiple medical visual question answering (VQA) tasks, and
provide theoretical insights into the efficacy of comparative image analysis in
medical diagnosis.

Result: 在合成和真实数据集中，检测精度和分类准确率达95-100%，且对领域偏移具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 证实了CNN在分散两相流相分离中的可行性，尤其在传统方法不适用时表现优异。

Abstract: This work investigates the feasibility of a post-processing-based approach
for phase separation in defocusing particle tracking velocimetry for dispersed
two-phase flows. The method enables the simultaneous 3D localization
determination of both tracer particles and particles of the dispersed phase,
using a single-camera setup. The distinction between phases is based on pattern
differences in defocused particle images, which arise from distinct light
scattering behaviors of tracer particles and bubbles or droplets. Convolutional
neural networks, including Faster R-CNN and YOLOv4 variants, are trained to
detect and classify particle images based on these pattern features. To
generate large, labeled training datasets, a generative adversarial network
based framework is introduced, allowing the generation of auto-labeled data
that more closely reflects experiment-specific visual appearance. Evaluation
across six datasets, comprising synthetic two-phase and real single- and
two-phase flows, demonstrates high detection precision and classification
accuracy (95-100%), even under domain shifts. The results confirm the viability
of using CNNs for robust phase separation in disperse two-phase DPTV,
particularly in scenarios where traditional wavelength-, size-, or ensemble
correlation-based methods are impractical.

Motivation: 手动标注密集对应关系耗时且不可扩展，而现有自监督方法因训练数据不足（视频收集困难，图像裁剪缺乏姿态变化）效果受限。

Method: 使用图像条件扩散模型生成多样合成视图，提出多锚点策略调节任务难度，并定量评估生成图像的局部和全局一致性。

Result: CDG-MAE显著优于仅依赖图像的MAE方法，大幅缩小了与基于视频方法的性能差距。

Conclusion: 通过合成视图和多锚点策略，CDG-MAE有效解决了数据不足问题，提升了自监督学习的性能。

Abstract: Learning dense correspondences, critical for application such as video label
propagation, is hindered by tedious and unscalable manual annotation.
Self-supervised methods address this by using a cross-view pretext task, often
modeled with a masked autoencoder, where a masked target view is reconstructed
from an anchor view. However, acquiring effective training data remains a
challenge - collecting diverse video datasets is difficult and costly, while
simple image crops lack necessary pose variations. This paper introduces
CDG-MAE, a novel MAE-based self-supervised method that uses diverse synthetic
views generated from static images via an image-conditioned diffusion model.
These generated views exhibit substantial changes in pose and perspective,
providing a rich training signal that overcomes the limitations of video and
crop-based anchors. We present a quantitative method to evaluate local and
global consistency of generated images, discussing their use for cross-view
self-supervised pretraining. Furthermore, we enhance the standard single-anchor
MAE setting to a multi-anchor strategy to effectively modulate the difficulty
of pretext task. CDG-MAE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art MAE methods
reliant only on images and substantially narrows the performance gap to
video-based approaches.

Abstract: Thyroid cancer is among the most common cancers in the United States. Thyroid
nodules are frequently detected through ultrasound (US) imaging, and some
require further evaluation via fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy. Despite its
effectiveness, FNA often leads to unnecessary biopsies of benign nodules,
causing patient discomfort and anxiety. To address this, the American College
of Radiology Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS) has been
developed to reduce benign biopsies. However, such systems are limited by
interobserver variability. Recent deep learning approaches have sought to
improve risk stratification, but they often fail to utilize the rich temporal
and spatial context provided by US cine clips, which contain dynamic global
information and surrounding structural changes across various views. In this
work, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Cross Attention for Cine Thyroid
Ultrasound Time Series Classification (STACT-Time) model, a novel
representation learning framework that integrates imaging features from US cine
clips with features from segmentation masks automatically generated by a
pretrained model. By leveraging self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms,
our model captures the rich temporal and spatial context of US cine clips while
enhancing feature representation through segmentation-guided learning. Our
model improves malignancy prediction compared to state-of-the-art models,
achieving a cross-validation precision of 0.91 (plus or minus 0.02) and an F1
score of 0.89 (plus or minus 0.02). By reducing unnecessary biopsies of benign
nodules while maintaining high sensitivity for malignancy detection, our model
has the potential to enhance clinical decision-making and improve patient
outcomes.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于少样本学习的植物病害分类框架DExNet，通过结合多个预训练CNN模型的观察，显著减少了对大规模训练数据的需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习模型在植物病害分类中因数据不足而性能受限的问题。

Method: 使用9个预训练的CNN模型提取特征嵌入，通过域适应和特征融合块结合Bi-LSTM分类器。

Result: 在PlantVillage数据集上，5-shot、10-shot和15-shot分类的准确率分别为89.06%、92.46%和94.07%，80-shot分类准确率达98.09%。

Conclusion: DExNet在数据有限的情况下优于现有方法，适用于单域、混合域和跨域场景。

Abstract: While deep learning-based architectures have been widely used for correctly
detecting and classifying plant diseases, they require large-scale datasets to
learn generalized features and achieve state-of-the-art performance. This poses
a challenge for such models to obtain satisfactory performance in classifying
leaf diseases with limited samples. This work proposes a few-shot learning
framework, Domain-adapted Expert Network (DExNet), for plant disease
classification that compensates for the lack of sufficient training data by
combining observations of a number of expert critics. It starts with extracting
the feature embeddings as 'observations' from nine 'critics' that are
state-of-the-art pre-trained CNN-based architectures. These critics are 'domain
adapted' using a publicly available leaf disease dataset having no overlapping
classes with the specific downstream task of interest. The observations are
then passed to the 'Feature Fusion Block' and finally to a classifier network
consisting of Bi-LSTM layers. The proposed pipeline is evaluated on the 10
classes of tomato leaf images from the PlantVillage dataset, achieving
promising accuracies of 89.06%, 92.46%, and 94.07%, respectively, for 5-shot,
10-shot, and 15-shot classification. Furthermore, an accuracy of 98.09+-0.7%
has been achieved in 80-shot classification, which is only 1.2% less than
state-of-the-art, allowing a 94.5% reduction in the training data requirement.
The proposed pipeline also outperforms existing works on leaf disease
classification with limited data in both laboratory and real-life conditions in
single-domain, mixed-domain, and cross-domain scenarios.

Conclusion: FMF-SLAM在复杂环境中具有实时性和高效性，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Visual SLAM is particularly challenging in environments affected by noise,
varying lighting conditions, and darkness. Learning-based optical flow
algorithms can leverage multiple modalities to address these challenges, but
traditional optical flow-based visual SLAM approaches often require significant
computational resources.To overcome this limitation, we propose FMF-SLAM, an
efficient multimodal fusion SLAM method that utilizes fast Fourier transform
(FFT) to enhance the algorithm efficiency. Specifically, we introduce a novel
Fourier-based self-attention and cross-attention mechanism to extract features
from RGB and depth signals. We further enhance the interaction of multimodal
features by incorporating multi-scale knowledge distillation across modalities.
We also demonstrate the practical feasibility of FMF-SLAM in real-world
scenarios with real time performance by integrating it with a security robot by
fusing with a global positioning module GNSS-RTK and global Bundle Adjustment.
Our approach is validated using video sequences from TUM, TartanAir, and our
real-world datasets, showcasing state-of-the-art performance under noisy,
varying lighting, and dark conditions.Our code and datasets are available at

*Ankit Sanjyal*

TL;DR: DINO-enhanced NeRF模型在极端少样本场景下表现不如基线NeRF，预训练视觉特征可能对少样本3D重建无益甚至有害。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索预训练视觉特征（如DINO）对少样本3D重建的增强效果，验证其在极端少样本场景下的有效性。

Method: 系统评估DINO增强的NeRF模型，包括基线NeRF、冻结DINO特征、LoRA微调特征和多尺度特征融合。

Result: 所有DINO变体表现均差于基线NeRF（PSNR 12.9-13.0 vs 14.71），表明预训练特征可能引入有害偏差。

Conclusion: 预训练视觉特征可能不适合少样本3D重建，建议关注几何一致性的简单架构。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have revolutionized 3D scene reconstruction
from sparse image collections. Recent work has explored integrating pre-trained
vision features, particularly from DINO, to enhance few-shot reconstruction
capabilities. However, the effectiveness of such approaches remains unclear,
especially in extreme few-shot scenarios. In this paper, we present a
systematic evaluation of DINO-enhanced NeRF models, comparing baseline NeRF,
frozen DINO features, LoRA fine-tuned features, and multi-scale feature fusion.
Surprisingly, our experiments reveal that all DINO variants perform worse than
the baseline NeRF, achieving PSNR values around 12.9 to 13.0 compared to the
baseline's 14.71. This counterintuitive result suggests that pre-trained vision
features may not be beneficial for few-shot 3D reconstruction and may even
introduce harmful biases. We analyze potential causes including feature-task
mismatch, overfitting to limited data, and integration challenges. Our findings
challenge common assumptions in the field and suggest that simpler
architectures focusing on geometric consistency may be more effective for
few-shot scenarios.

Motivation: 传统膝关节对齐测量方法耗时且依赖长腿X光片，需要自动化解决方案以提高效率和准确性。

Method: 采用沙漏网络结合注意力门结构，自动定位100多个膝关节解剖标志，实现膝关节对齐测量。

Result: 方法在术前和术后图像上均表现优异，与临床测量结果差异约1°，ICC值显示高度一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法可高精度自动化膝关节对齐评估，为临床工作流程提供数字化支持。

Abstract: Radiographic knee alignment (KA) measurement is important for predicting
joint health and surgical outcomes after total knee replacement. Traditional
methods for KA measurements are manual, time-consuming and require long-leg
radiographs. This study proposes a deep learning-based method to measure KA in
anteroposterior knee radiographs via automatically localized knee anatomical
landmarks. Our method builds on hourglass networks and incorporates an
attention gate structure to enhance robustness and focus on key anatomical
features. To our knowledge, this is the first deep learning-based method to
localize over 100 knee anatomical landmarks to fully outline the knee shape
while integrating KA measurements on both pre-operative and post-operative
images. It provides highly accurate and reliable anatomical varus/valgus KA
measurements using the anatomical tibiofemoral angle, achieving mean absolute
differences ~1{\deg} when compared to clinical ground truth measurements.
Agreement between automated and clinical measurements was excellent
pre-operatively (intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.97) and good
post-operatively (ICC = 0.86). Our findings demonstrate that KA assessment can
be automated with high accuracy, creating opportunities for digitally enhanced
clinical workflows.

Conclusion: 改进的偏振模型和学习方法显著提升了透明物体形状估计的准确性，为相关领域提供了新工具。

Abstract: Shape estimation for transparent objects is challenging due to their complex
light transport. To circumvent these difficulties, we leverage the Shape from
Polarization (SfP) technique in the Long-Wave Infrared (LWIR) spectrum, where
most materials are opaque and emissive. While a few prior studies have explored
LWIR SfP, these attempts suffered from significant errors due to inadequate
polarimetric modeling, particularly the neglect of reflection. Addressing this
gap, we formulated a polarization model that explicitly accounts for the
combined effects of emission and reflection. Based on this model, we estimated
surface normals using not only a direct model-based method but also a
learning-based approach employing a neural network trained on a
physically-grounded synthetic dataset. Furthermore, we modeled the LWIR
polarimetric imaging process, accounting for inherent systematic errors to
ensure accurate polarimetry. We implemented a prototype system and created
ThermoPol, the first real-world benchmark dataset for LWIR SfP. Through
comprehensive experiments, we demonstrated the high accuracy and broad
applicability of our method across various materials, including those
transparent in the visible spectrum.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源匮乏地区，缺乏可靠的视网膜疾病诊断设备，需要一种轻量化的解决方案。

Method: 使用预训练的ViT教师模型，通过跨注意力投影器和多视图鲁棒训练方法，压缩为CNN学生模型。

Result: 学生模型参数减少97.4%，分类准确率达89%，保留了教师模型93%的诊断性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为资源有限地区提供了一种可扩展的视网膜疾病AI分诊解决方案。

Abstract: Early and accurate identification of retinal ailments is crucial for averting
ocular decline; however, access to dependable diagnostic devices is not often
available in low-resourced settings. This project proposes to solve that by
developing a lightweight, edge-device deployable disease classifier using
cross-architecture knowledge distilling. We first train a high-capacity vision
transformer (ViT) teacher model, pre-trained using I-JEPA self-supervised
learning, to classify fundus images into four classes: Normal, Diabetic
Retinopathy, Glaucoma, and Cataract. We kept an Internet of Things (IoT) focus
when compressing to a CNN-based student model for deployment in
resource-limited conditions, such as the NVIDIA Jetson Nano. This was
accomplished using a novel framework which included a Partitioned
Cross-Attention (PCA) projector, a Group-Wise Linear (GL) projector, and a
multi-view robust training method. The teacher model has 97.4 percent more
parameters than the student model, with it achieving 89 percent classification
with a roughly 93 percent retention of the teacher model's diagnostic
performance. The retention of clinical classification behavior supports our
method's initial aim: compression of the ViT while retaining accuracy. Our work
serves as an example of a scalable, AI-driven triage solution for retinal
disorders in under-resourced areas.

Motivation: 解决自回归图像生成模型中长上下文导致的KV缓存内存开销和计算延迟问题。

Method: 提出ADSA方法，动态识别关键历史token，优化注意力计算，并引入动态KV缓存更新机制。

Result: 实验表明ADSA在生成质量和资源效率上均表现优越，GPU内存消耗减少约50%。

Conclusion: ADSA有效解决了长上下文问题，提升了图像生成模型的效率和性能。

Abstract: Autoregressive conditional image generation models have emerged as a dominant
paradigm in text-to-image synthesis. These methods typically convert images
into one-dimensional token sequences and leverage the self-attention mechanism,
which has achieved remarkable success in natural language processing, to
capture long-range dependencies, model global context, and ensure semantic
coherence. However, excessively long contexts during inference lead to
significant memory overhead caused by KV-cache and computational delays. To
alleviate these challenges, we systematically analyze how global semantics,
spatial layouts, and fine-grained textures are formed during inference, and
propose a novel training-free context optimization method called Adaptive
Dynamic Sparse Attention (ADSA). Conceptually, ADSA dynamically identifies
historical tokens crucial for maintaining local texture consistency and those
essential for ensuring global semantic coherence, thereby efficiently
streamlining attention computation. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic
KV-cache update mechanism tailored for ADSA, reducing GPU memory consumption
during inference by approximately $50\%$. Extensive qualitative and
quantitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our
approach in terms of both generation quality and resource efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决VLM在自动驾驶中过度依赖历史信息和推理与规划不对齐的两大挑战。

Result: 在nuScenes和DriveLM-nuScenes基准测试中表现优于现有VLM。

Conclusion: Drive-R1为自动驾驶中的推理与规划提供了新方向，具有方法论启示。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) for autonomous driving (AD) are evolving
beyond perception and cognition tasks toward motion planning. However, we
identify two critical challenges in this direction: (1) VLMs tend to learn
shortcuts by relying heavily on history input information, achieving seemingly
strong planning results without genuinely understanding the visual inputs; and
(2) the chain-ofthought (COT) reasoning processes are always misaligned with
the motion planning outcomes, and how to effectively leverage the complex
reasoning capability to enhance planning remains largely underexplored. In this
paper, we start from a small-scale domain-specific VLM and propose Drive-R1
designed to bridges the scenario reasoning and motion planning for AD. Drive-R1
first undergoes the supervised finetuning on a elaborate dataset containing
both long and short COT data. Drive-R1 is encouraged to reason step-by-step
from visual input to final planning decisions. Subsequently, Drive-R1 is
trained within a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes the
discovery of reasoning paths that are more informative for planning, guided by
rewards based on predicted trajectories and meta actions. Experimental
evaluations on the nuScenes and DriveLM-nuScenes benchmarks demonstrate that
Drive-R1 achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art
VLMs. We believe that Drive-R1 presents a promising direction for bridging
reasoning and planning in AD, offering methodological insights for future
research and applications.

Conclusion: REIR任务填补了现有方法的不足，CLARE展示了高效性和通用性。

Abstract: Natural language querying of visual content underpins many vision-language
tasks, typically categorized by text granularity and visual search scope.
Text-Image Retrieval (TIR) retrieves whole images using coarse descriptions,
while Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) localizes objects using
fine-grained expressions within a single image. However, real-world scenarios
often require both instance-level retrieval and localization across large
galleries -- tasks where TIR lacks precision and REC lacks scalability. To
address this gap, we propose a new task: Referring Expression Instance
Retrieval (REIR), which jointly supports instance-level retrieval and
localization. We introduce REIRCOCO, a large-scale benchmark constructed by
prompting vision-language models to generate fine-grained expressions for
MSCOCO and RefCOCO instances. We also present a baseline method, CLARE,
featuring a dual-stream architecture with a Mix of Relation Experts (MORE)
module for capturing inter-instance relationships. CLARE integrates object
detection and REC pretraining with Contrastive Language-Instance Alignment
(CLIA) for end-to-end optimization. Experiments show that CLARE achieves
state-of-the-art performance on REIR and generalizes well to TIR and REC,
highlighting its effectiveness and versatility.

Conclusion: 通过语义结构感知和特征蒸馏，显著提升了对抗扰动的迁移性和效率。

Abstract: Generative adversarial attacks train a perturbation generator on a white-box
surrogate model and subsequently apply the crafted perturbations to unseen
black-box victim models. In contrast to iterative attacks, these methods
deliver superior inference-time efficiency, scalability, and transferability;
however, up until now, existing studies have not fully exploited the
representational capacity of generative models to preserve and harness semantic
information. Specifically, the intermediate activations of the generator encode
rich semantic features--object boundaries and coarse shapes--that remain
under-exploited, thereby limiting the alignment of perturbations with
object-salient regions which are critical for adversarial transferability. To
remedy this, we introduce a semantic structure-aware attack framework based on
the Mean Teacher, which serves as a temporally smoothed feature reference. With
this smoothed reference, we further direct semantic consistency between the
early-layer activations in the student and those of the semantically rich
teacher by feature distillation. By anchoring perturbation synthesis to the
semantically salient early intermediate blocks within the generator based on
empirical findings, our method guides progressive adversarial perturbation on
regions that substantially enhance adversarial transferability. We conduct
extensive experiments over diverse models, domains and tasks to demonstrate
consistent improvements relative to state-of-the-art generative attacks,
comprehensively evaluated using conventional metrics and our newly proposed
Accidental Correction Rate (ACR).

Abstract: Weakly supervised temporal action localization is a challenging task as only
the video-level annotation is available during the training process. To address
this problem, we propose a two-stage approach to fully exploit multi-resolution
information in the temporal domain and generate high quality frame-level pseudo
labels based on both appearance and motion streams. Specifically, in the first
stage, we generate reliable initial frame-level pseudo labels, and in the
second stage, we iteratively refine the pseudo labels and use a set of selected
frames with highly confident pseudo labels to train neural networks and better
predict action class scores at each frame. We fully exploit temporal
information at multiple scales to improve temporal action localization
performance. Specifically, in order to obtain reliable initial frame-level
pseudo labels, in the first stage, we propose an Initial Label Generation (ILG)
module, which leverages temporal multi-resolution consistency to generate high
quality class activation sequences (CASs), which consist of a number of
sequences with each sequence measuring how likely each video frame belongs to
one specific action class. In the second stage, we propose a Progressive
Temporal Label Refinement (PTLR) framework. In our PTLR framework, two networks
called Network-OTS and Network-RTS, which are respectively used to generate
CASs for the original temporal scale and the reduced temporal scales, are used
as two streams (i.e., the OTS stream and the RTS stream) to refine the pseudo
labels in turn. By this way, the multi-resolution information in the temporal
domain is exchanged at the pseudo label level, and our work can help improve
each stream (i.e., the OTS/RTS stream) by exploiting the refined pseudo labels
from another stream (i.e., the RTS/OTS stream).

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction in the past was considered to require
precise geometric relationships in order to enable effective training. However,
in complex indoor environments, the large-scale and widespread collection of
data, along with the necessity for fine-grained annotations, becomes
impractical due to the complexity of data acquisition setups and privacy
concerns. In this paper, we demonstrate that 3D spatially-accurate training can
be achieved using only indoor Internet data, without the need for any
pre-knowledge of intrinsic or extrinsic camera parameters. In our framework, we
collect a web dataset, YouTube-Occ, which comprises house tour videos from
YouTube, providing abundant real house scenes for 3D representation learning.
Upon on this web dataset, we establish a fully self-supervised model to
leverage accessible 2D prior knowledge for reaching powerful 3D indoor
perception. Specifically, we harness the advantages of the prosperous vision
foundation models, distilling the 2D region-level knowledge into the occupancy
network by grouping the similar pixels into superpixels. Experimental results
show that our method achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on two
popular benchmarks (NYUv2 and OccScanNet

Abstract: Thermal cameras capture environmental data through heat emission, a
fundamentally different mechanism compared to visible light cameras, which rely
on pinhole imaging. As a result, traditional visual relocalization methods
designed for visible light images are not directly applicable to thermal
images. Despite significant advancements in deep learning for camera
relocalization, approaches specifically tailored for thermal camera-based
relocalization remain underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce
ThermalLoc, a novel end-to-end deep learning method for thermal image
relocalization. ThermalLoc effectively extracts both local and global features
from thermal images by integrating EfficientNet with Transformers, and performs
absolute pose regression using two MLP networks. We evaluated ThermalLoc on
both the publicly available thermal-odometry dataset and our own dataset. The
results demonstrate that ThermalLoc outperforms existing representative methods
employed for thermal camera relocalization, including AtLoc, MapNet, PoseNet,
and RobustLoc, achieving superior accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: As the deep learning revolution marches on, masked modeling has emerged as a
distinctive approach that involves predicting parts of the original data that
are proportionally masked during training, and has demonstrated exceptional
performance in multiple fields. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) reconstruction
is a critical task in medical imaging that seeks to recover high-quality images
from under-sampled k-space data. However, previous MRI reconstruction
strategies usually optimized the entire image domain or k-space, without
considering the importance of different frequency regions in the k-space This
work introduces a diffusion model based on adaptive masks (AMDM), which
utilizes the adaptive adjustment of frequency distribution based on k-space
data to develop a hybrid masks mechanism that adapts to different k-space
inputs. This enables the effective separation of high-frequency and
low-frequency components, producing diverse frequency-specific representations.
Additionally, the k-space frequency distribution informs the generation of
adaptive masks, which, in turn, guide a closed-loop diffusion process.
Experimental results verified the ability of this method to learn specific
frequency information and thereby improved the quality of MRI reconstruction,
providing a flexible framework for optimizing k-space data using masks in the
future.

Abstract: Image explanation has been one of the key research interests in the Deep
Learning field. Throughout the years, several approaches have been adopted to
explain an input image fed by the user. From detecting an object in a given
image to explaining it in human understandable sentence, to having a
conversation describing the image, this problem has seen an immense change
throughout the years, However, the existing works have been often found to (a)
hallucinate objects that do not exist in the image and/or (b) lack identifying
the complete set of objects present in the image. In this paper, we propose a
novel approach to mitigate these drawbacks of inconsistency and incompleteness
of the objects recognized during the image explanation. To enable this, we
propose an interpretable framework that can be plugged atop diverse image
explaining frameworks including Image Captioning, Visual Question Answering
(VQA) and Prompt-based AI using LLMs, thereby enhancing their explanation
capabilities by rectifying the incorrect or missing objects. We further measure
the efficacy of the rectified explanations generated through our proposed
approaches leveraging object based precision metrics, and showcase the
improvements in the inconsistency and completeness of image explanations.
Quantitatively, the proposed framework is able to improve the explanations over
the baseline architectures of Image Captioning (improving the completeness by
81.81% and inconsistency by 37.10%), Visual Question Answering(average of 9.6%
and 37.10% in completeness and inconsistency respectively) and Prompt-based AI
model (0.01% and 5.2% for completeness and inconsistency respectively)
surpassing the current state-of-the-art by a substantial margin.

Conclusion: OSR技术对AI系统在内窥镜中的安全部署至关重要，研究为未来工作奠定了基础。

Abstract: Endoscopic image classification plays a pivotal role in medical diagnostics
by identifying anatomical landmarks and pathological findings. However,
conventional closed-set classification frameworks are inherently limited in
open-world clinical settings, where previously unseen conditions can arise
andcompromise model reliability. To address this, we explore the application of
Open Set Recognition (OSR) techniques on the Kvasir dataset, a publicly
available and diverse endoscopic image collection. In this study, we evaluate
and compare the OSR capabilities of several representative deep learning
architectures, including ResNet-50, Swin Transformer, and a hybrid
ResNet-Transformer model, under both closed-set and open-set conditions.
OpenMax is adopted as a baseline OSR method to assess the ability of these
models to distinguish known classes from previously unseen categories. This
work represents one of the first efforts to apply open set recognition to the
Kvasir dataset and provides a foundational benchmark for evaluating OSR
performance in medical image analysis. Our results offer practical insights
into model behavior in clinically realistic settings and highlight the
importance of OSR techniques for the safe deployment of AI systems in
endoscopy.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce OmniGen2, a versatile and open-source generative
model designed to provide a unified solution for diverse generation tasks,
including text-to-image, image editing, and in-context generation. Unlike
OmniGen v1, OmniGen2 features two distinct decoding pathways for text and image
modalities, utilizing unshared parameters and a decoupled image tokenizer. This
design enables OmniGen2 to build upon existing multimodal understanding models
without the need to re-adapt VAE inputs, thereby preserving the original text
generation capabilities. To facilitate the training of OmniGen2, we developed
comprehensive data construction pipelines, encompassing image editing and
in-context generation data. Additionally, we introduce a reflection mechanism
tailored for image generation tasks and curate a dedicated reflection dataset
based on OmniGen2. Despite its relatively modest parameter size, OmniGen2
achieves competitive results on multiple task benchmarks, including
text-to-image and image editing. To further evaluate in-context generation,
also referred to as subject-driven tasks, we introduce a new benchmark named
OmniContext. OmniGen2 achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source
models in terms of consistency. We will release our models, training code,
datasets, and data construction pipeline to support future research in this
field. Project Page: https://vectorspacelab.github.io/OmniGen2; GitHub Link:

Conclusion: Tar框架成功统一视觉与文本表示，为多模态任务提供了高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a multimodal framework that attempts to unify visual
understanding and generation within a shared discrete semantic representation.
At its core is the Text-Aligned Tokenizer (TA-Tok), which converts images into
discrete tokens using a text-aligned codebook projected from a large language
model's (LLM) vocabulary. By integrating vision and text into a unified space
with an expanded vocabulary, our multimodal LLM, Tar, enables cross-modal input
and output through a shared interface, without the need for modality-specific
designs. Additionally, we propose scale-adaptive encoding and decoding to
balance efficiency and visual detail, along with a generative de-tokenizer to
produce high-fidelity visual outputs. To address diverse decoding needs, we
utilize two complementary de-tokenizers: a fast autoregressive model and a
diffusion-based model. To enhance modality fusion, we investigate advanced
pre-training tasks, demonstrating improvements in both visual understanding and
generation. Experiments across benchmarks show that Tar matches or surpasses
existing multimodal LLM methods, achieving faster convergence and greater
training efficiency. Code, models, and data are available at

Conclusion: RP-PCN可扩展至其他作物，显著提升田间群体冠层结构的分析能力。

Abstract: Quantitative descriptions of complete canopy architecture are crucial for
evaluating crop photosynthesis and yield to guide ideotype design. Although
three-dimensional (3D) sensing technologies have been developed for plant and
canopy reconstruction, severe occlusion and complex architectures hinder
accurate canopy descriptions. In this study, we propose a point cloud
completion model for 3D reconstruction of rapeseed populations from seeding to
silique stages using multi-view imaging. A complete point cloud generation
framework was developed with the virtual-real integration (VRI) simulation
method and occlusion point detection algorithm to annotate the training dataset
by distinguishing surface from occluded points. The rapeseed population point
cloud completion network (RP-PCN) was designed with a multi-resolution dynamic
graph convolutional encoder (MRDG) and point pyramid decoder (PPD) to predict
occluded points based on input surface point clouds. A dynamic graph
convolutional feature extractor (DGCFE) was introduced to capture structural
variations across the growth period. The effectiveness of point cloud
completion was validated by predicting yield using architectural indicators
from complete point clouds of rapeseed population. The results demonstrated
that RP-PCN achieved chamfer distance (CD) values of 3.35 cm, 3.46 cm, 4.32 cm,
and 4.51 cm at the seedling, bolting, flowering, and silique stages,
respectively. Ablation studies showed the effectiveness of the MRDG and DGCFE
modules, reducing CD values by 10% and 23%, respectively. The silique
efficiency index (SEI) from RP-PCN improved yield prediction accuracy by 11.2%
compared to incomplete point clouds. The RP-PCN pipeline proposed in this study
has the potential to be extended to other crops, significantly enhancing the
analysis of population canopy architectures in field environments.

Abstract: Remote sensing offers a highly effective method for obtaining accurate
information on total cropped area and crop types. The study focuses on crop
cover identification for irrigated regions of Central Punjab. Data collection
was executed in two stages: the first involved identifying and geocoding six
target crops through field surveys conducted in January and February 2023. The
second stage involved acquiring Landsat 8-9 imagery for each geocoded field to
construct a labelled dataset. The satellite imagery underwent extensive
pre-processing, including radiometric calibration for reflectance values,
atmospheric correction, and georeferencing verification to ensure consistency
within a common coordinate system. Subsequently, image fusion techniques were
applied to combine Landsat 8 and 9 spectral bands, creating a composite image
with enhanced spectral information, followed by contrast enhancement. During
data acquisition, farmers were interviewed, and fields were meticulously mapped
using GPS instruments, resulting in a comprehensive dataset of 50,835 data
points. This dataset facilitated the extraction of vegetation indices such as
NDVI, SAVO, RECI, and NDRE. These indices and raw reflectance values were
utilized for classification modeling using conventional classifiers, ensemble
learning, and artificial neural networks. A feature selection approach was also
incorporated to identify the optimal feature set for classification learning.
This study demonstrates the effectiveness of combining remote sensing data and
advanced modeling techniques to improve crop classification accuracy in
irrigated agricultural regions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索LVLMs在缺乏明确任务监督的情况下，如何因虚假相关性而产生错误，尤其是在真实世界任务中。

Method: 方法包括利用GPT-4的错误数据构建SpuriVerse基准，并通过人工标注和合成反事实评估来识别虚假相关性。

Result: 实验结果显示，即使是顶尖的闭源模型在SpuriVerse上的准确率也仅为37.1%，但通过针对性微调可提升至78.4%。

Conclusion: 结论表明，模型可以通过学习多样化的虚假相关性模式来避免“捷径”，并更好地关注图像上下文。

Abstract: Finetuning can cause spurious correlations to arise between non-essential
features and the target labels, but benchmarks to study these effects involve
contrived settings and narrow tasks. In contrast, we consider spurious
correlations in multi-modal Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) pretrained on
extensive and diverse datasets without explicit task supervision. We develop a
benchmark by sourcing GPT-4o errors on real-world visual-question-answering
(VQA) benchmarks, then curating a subset through LVLM-human annotation and
synthetic counterfactual evaluation to identify errors caused by spurious
correlations. This process yields SpuriVerse, a novel benchmark comprised of
124 distinct types of spurious correlations extracted from real-world datasets,
each containing 1 realistic and 10 synthetic VQA samples for a total of 1364
multiple choice questions. We evaluate 15 open and closed-source LVLMs on
SpuriVerse, finding that even state-of-the-art closed-source models struggle
significantly, achieving at best only 37.1% accuracy. Fine-tuning on synthetic
examples that emphasize the spurious correlation improves performance to
78.40%, suggesting that training on diverse spurious patterns generalizes to
unseen situations: models appear to learn to avoid "shortcuts" and attend to
the overall image context.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement remains a challenging task, particularly in the
absence of paired training data. In this study, we present LucentVisionNet, a
novel zero-shot learning framework that addresses the limitations of
traditional and deep learning-based enhancement methods. The proposed approach
integrates multi-scale spatial attention with a deep curve estimation network,
enabling fine-grained enhancement while preserving semantic and perceptual
fidelity. To further improve generalization, we adopt a recurrent enhancement
strategy and optimize the model using a composite loss function comprising six
tailored components, including a novel no-reference image quality loss inspired
by human visual perception. Extensive experiments on both paired and unpaired
benchmark datasets demonstrate that LucentVisionNet consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art supervised, unsupervised, and zero-shot methods across
multiple full-reference and no-reference image quality metrics. Our framework
achieves high visual quality, structural consistency, and computational

Motivation: 随着文本到图像模型的发展，生成有害内容的风险增加，需要一种方法在不改变模型架构的情况下实现内容净化。

Method: 提出PromptSan，包括两种变体：PromptSan-Modify（迭代替换有害词）和PromptSan-Suffix（训练后缀序列中和有害意图）。

Result: 实验表明PromptSan在减少有害内容生成方面表现优异，平衡了安全性和可用性。

Conclusion: PromptSan是一种有效的提示词净化方法，为文本到图像模型的可持续发展提供了解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) models, such as Stable
Diffusion, has enhanced their capability to synthesize images from textual
prompts. However, this progress also raises significant risks of misuse,
including the generation of harmful content (e.g., pornography, violence,
discrimination), which contradicts the ethical goals of T2I technology and
hinders its sustainable development. Inspired by "jailbreak" attacks in large
language models, which bypass restrictions through subtle prompt modifications,
this paper proposes NSFW-Classifier Guided Prompt Sanitization (PromptSan), a
novel approach to detoxify harmful prompts without altering model architecture
or degrading generation capability. PromptSan includes two variants:
PromptSan-Modify, which iteratively identifies and replaces harmful tokens in
input prompts using text NSFW classifiers during inference, and
PromptSan-Suffix, which trains an optimized suffix token sequence to neutralize
harmful intent while passing both text and image NSFW classifier checks.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that PromptSan achieves state-of-the-art
performance in reducing harmful content generation across multiple metrics,
effectively balancing safety and usability.

Conclusion: 该框架为基于自然语言的高质量3D内容生成提供了更符合人类偏好的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D generative models have achieved impressive results but
3D contents generated by these models may not align with subjective human
preferences or task-specific criteria. Moreover, a core challenge in the 3D
texture generation domain remains: most existing approaches rely on repeated
calls to 2D text-to-image generative models, which lack an inherent
understanding of the 3D structure of the input 3D mesh object. To address this,
we propose an end-to-end differentiable preference learning framework that
back-propagates human preferences, represented by differentiable reward
functions, through the entire 3D generative pipeline, making the process
inherently geometry-aware. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework
using four proposed novel geometry-aware reward functions, offering a more
controllable and interpretable pathway for high-quality 3D content creation
from natural language.

Conclusion: 该方法通过改进特征整合和解码器设计，显著提升了医学图像分割的准确性。

Abstract: Segmenting biomarkers in medical images is crucial for various biotech
applications. Despite advances, Transformer and CNN based methods often
struggle with variations in staining and morphology, limiting feature
extraction. In medical image segmentation, where datasets often have limited
sample availability, recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods achieve higher
accuracy by leveraging pre-trained encoders, whereas end-to-end methods tend to
underperform. This is due to challenges in effectively transferring rich
multiscale features from encoders to decoders, as well as limitations in
decoder efficiency. To address these issues, we propose an architecture that
captures multi-scale local and global contextual information and a novel
decoder design, which effectively integrates features from the encoder,
emphasizes important channels and regions, and reconstructs spatial dimensions
to enhance segmentation accuracy. Our method, compatible with various encoders,
outperforms SOTA methods, as demonstrated by experiments on four datasets and
ablation studies. Specifically, our method achieves absolute performance gains
of 2.76% on MoNuSeg, 3.12% on DSB, 2.87% on Electron Microscopy, and 4.03% on
TNBC datasets compared to existing SOTA methods. Code:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有低光图像增强方法在提升亮度的同时难以保持语义一致性和细节，且现有视觉Mamba方法因固定扫描规则限制了长距离依赖的捕捉。

Method: BSMamba包含亮度Mamba和语义Mamba，分别基于亮度和语义相似性建模令牌交互，突破传统扫描模式的限制。

Result: 实验表明，BSMamba在低光图像增强任务中实现了最先进的性能，同时保持了语义一致性。

Conclusion: BSMamba通过亮度与语义引导的令牌交互，显著提升了低光图像增强的效果。

Abstract: Current low-light image enhancement (LLIE) methods face significant
limitations in simultaneously improving brightness while preserving semantic
consistency, fine details, and computational efficiency. With the emergence of
state-space models, particularly Mamba, image restoration has achieved
remarkable performance, yet existing visual Mamba approaches flatten 2D images
into 1D token sequences using fixed scanning rules, critically limiting
interactions between distant tokens with causal relationships and constraining
their ability to capture meaningful long-range dependencies. To address these
fundamental limitations, we propose BSMamba, a novel visual Mamba architecture
comprising two specially designed components: Brightness Mamba and Semantic
Mamba. The Brightness Mamba revolutionizes token interaction patterns by
prioritizing connections between distant tokens with similar brightness levels,
effectively addressing the challenge of brightness restoration in LLIE tasks
through brightness-guided selective attention. Complementing this, the Semantic
Mamba establishes priority interactions between tokens sharing similar semantic
meanings, allowing the model to maintain contextual consistency by connecting
semantically related regions across the image, thus preserving the hierarchical
nature of image semantics during enhancement. By intelligently modeling tokens
based on brightness and semantic similarity rather than arbitrary scanning
patterns, BSMamba transcends the constraints of conventional token sequencing
while adhering to the principles of causal modeling. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that BSMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in LLIE while
preserving semantic consistency.

Conclusion: SFIFNet通过整合频域信息，显著改善了小样本学习的分类效果。

Abstract: The objective of Few-shot learning is to fully leverage the limited data
resources for exploring the latent correlations within the data by applying
algorithms and training a model with outstanding performance that can
adequately meet the demands of practical applications. In practical
applications, the number of images in each category is usually less than that
in traditional deep learning, which can lead to over-fitting and poor
generalization performance. Currently, many Few-shot classification models pay
more attention to spatial domain information while neglecting frequency domain
information, which contains more feature information. Ignoring frequency domain
information will prevent the model from fully exploiting feature information,
which would effect the classification performance. Based on conventional data
augmentation, this paper proposes an SFIFNet with innovative data
preprocessing. The key of this method is enhancing the accuracy of image
feature representation by integrating frequency domain information with spatial
domain information. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
this method in enhancing classification performance.

Method: 通过自回归因子化在关键点级别建模骨骼序列密度，利用条件高斯分布预测关键点位置，并通过加权对数条件概率计算异常分数。

Result: 在UBnormal、MSAD-HR数据集上表现最优，在ShanghaiTech数据集上表现竞争性。

Conclusion: SeeKer方法简单有效，在异常检测任务中优于现有方法。

Abstract: Detecting anomalous human behaviour is an important visual task in
safety-critical applications such as healthcare monitoring, workplace safety,
or public surveillance. In these contexts, abnormalities are often reflected
with unusual human poses. Thus, we propose SeeKer, a method for detecting
anomalies in sequences of human skeletons. Our method formulates the skeleton
sequence density through autoregressive factorization at the keypoint level.
The corresponding conditional distributions represent probable keypoint
locations given prior skeletal motion. We formulate the joint distribution of
the considered skeleton as causal prediction of conditional Gaussians across
its constituent keypoints. A skeleton is flagged as anomalous if its keypoint
locations surprise our model (i.e. receive a low density). In practice, our
anomaly score is a weighted sum of per-keypoint log-conditionals, where the
weights account for the confidence of the underlying keypoint detector. Despite
its conceptual simplicity, SeeKer surpasses all previous methods on the
UBnormal and MSAD-HR datasets while delivering competitive performance on the
ShanghaiTech dataset.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于强化学习的后训练框架，显著提升了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在个性化图像描述生成中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于监督微调（SFT）的后训练方法在生成个性化图像描述时表现不佳，尤其是在复杂场景下。大规模高质量标注数据获取困难。

Method: 采用强化学习（RL）的后训练框架，首次将RL应用于MLLMs的个性化图像描述任务。

Result: 该方法显著提升了MLLMs的视觉识别和个性化生成能力，在多概念图像描述任务中表现优于现有SFT基线。

Conclusion: RL框架有效解决了数据依赖问题，为MLLMs的个性化图像描述提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) often struggle to generate
personalized image captions, even when trained on high-quality captions. In
this work, we observe that such limitations persist in existing
post-training-based MLLM personalization methods. Specifically, despite being
post-tuned with large-scale caption data through supervised fine-tuning (SFT),
these models frequently fail to produce faithful descriptions in real-world
scenarios, such as multi-concept image captioning. However, acquiring
large-scale, high-quality captions for such complex settings is both costly and
difficult. To address the data-centric nature of SFT, we propose a
reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training framework. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first RL-based approach to post-train MLLMs for
personalized image captioning. Our method significantly enhances both visual
recognition and personalized generation capabilities of MLLMs, and consistently
outperforms existing SFT-based baselines, especially in the challenging
multi-concept image captioning task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 黑色素瘤的高死亡率需要早期、可解释的诊断工具，现有深度学习模型仅提供二元分类，临床价值有限。

Method: 使用条件变分自编码器学习结构化潜在空间，结合SVM进行分类，捕捉病变的语义关系。

Result: 方法在区分良性痣和黑色素瘤上表现优异，潜在空间支持视觉和几何解释。

Conclusion: 该方法结合预测性能和临床适用性，提升早期检测和AI诊断的可信度。

Abstract: Melanoma represents a critical health risk due to its aggressive progression
and high mortality, underscoring the need for early, interpretable diagnostic
tools. While deep learning has advanced in skin lesion classification, most
existing models provide only binary outputs, offering limited clinical insight.
This work introduces a novel approach that extends beyond classification,
enabling interpretable risk modelling through a Conditional Variational
Autoencoder. The proposed method learns a structured latent space that captures
semantic relationships among lesions, allowing for a nuanced, continuous
assessment of morphological differences. An SVM is also trained on this
representation effectively differentiating between benign nevi and melanomas,
demonstrating strong and consistent performance. More importantly, the learned
latent space supports visual and geometric interpretation of malignancy, with
the spatial proximity of a lesion to known melanomas serving as a meaningful
indicator of risk. This approach bridges predictive performance with clinical
applicability, fostering early detection, highlighting ambiguous cases, and
enhancing trust in AI-assisted diagnosis through transparent and interpretable
decision-making.

limited in scale, visual diversity, and instruction expressiveness. In this
work, we introduce InternSpatial, the largest open-source dataset for spatial
reasoning in VLMs, along with InternSpatial-Bench, a corresponding evaluation
benchmark designed to assess spatial understanding under diverse instruction
formats. InternSpatial comprises 12 million QA pairs spanning both single-view
and multi-view settings, drawn from diverse visual environments and supporting
19 instruction formats that reflect varied query styles. For evaluation, we
propose InternSpatial-Bench for single-view tasks and expand multi-view
reasoning by introducing a novel rotation angle prediction task that has not
been explored in prior work. Experimental results show that models trained on
InternSpatial achieve 12.1% improvement on InternSpatial-Bench and 10.7% on

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds significant promise for improving
prognosis prediction in medical imaging, yet its effective application remains
challenging. In this work, we introduce a structured benchmark explicitly
designed to evaluate and compare the transferability of Convolutional Neural
Networks and Foundation Models in predicting clinical outcomes in COVID-19
patients, leveraging diverse publicly available Chest X-ray datasets. Our
experimental methodology extensively explores a wide set of fine-tuning
strategies, encompassing traditional approaches such as Full Fine-Tuning and
Linear Probing, as well as advanced Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning methods
including Low-Rank Adaptation, BitFit, VeRA, and IA3. The evaluations were
conducted across multiple learning paradigms, including both extensive
full-data scenarios and more clinically realistic Few-Shot Learning settings,
which are critical for modeling rare disease outcomes and rapidly emerging
health threats. By implementing a large-scale comparative analysis involving a
diverse selection of pretrained models, including general-purpose architectures
pretrained on large-scale datasets such as CLIP and DINOv2, to
biomedical-specific models like MedCLIP, BioMedCLIP, and PubMedCLIP, we
rigorously assess each model's capacity to effectively adapt and generalize to
prognosis tasks, particularly under conditions of severe data scarcity and
pronounced class imbalance. The benchmark was designed to capture critical
conditions common in prognosis tasks, including variations in dataset size and
class distribution, providing detailed insights into the strengths and
limitations of each fine-tuning strategy. This extensive and structured
evaluation aims to inform the practical deployment and adoption of robust,
efficient, and generalizable AI-driven solutions in real-world clinical
prognosis prediction workflows.

Result: 实验结果表明该方法优于其他分布式多目标滤波器。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了PMB密度GCI融合问题，并在实验中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: This paper presents the distributed Poisson multi-Bernoulli (PMB) filter
based on the generalised covariance intersection (GCI) fusion rule for
distributed multi-object filtering. Since the exact GCI fusion of two PMB
densities is intractable, we derive a principled approximation. Specifically,
we approximate the power of a PMB density as an unnormalised PMB density, which
corresponds to an upper bound of the PMB density. Then, the GCI fusion rule
corresponds to the normalised product of two unnormalised PMB densities. We
show that the result is a Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture (PMBM), which can be
expressed in closed form. Future prediction and update steps in each filter
preserve the PMBM form, which can be projected back to a PMB density before the
next fusion step. Experimental results show the benefits of this approach
compared to other distributed multi-object filters.

Abstract: Recently, vision-language pretraining has emerged as a transformative
technique that integrates the strengths of both visual and textual modalities,
resulting in powerful vision-language models (VLMs). Leveraging web-scale
pretraining data, these models exhibit strong zero-shot capabilities. However,
their performance often deteriorates when confronted with domain-specific or
specialized generalization tasks. To address this, a growing body of research
focuses on transferring or generalizing the rich knowledge embedded in VLMs to
various downstream applications. This survey aims to comprehensively summarize
the generalization settings, methodologies, benchmarking and results in VLM
literatures. Delving into the typical VLM structures, current literatures are
categorized into prompt-based, parameter-based and feature-based methods
according to the transferred modules. The differences and characteristics in
each category are furthered summarized and discussed by revisiting the typical
transfer learning (TL) settings, providing novel interpretations for TL in the
era of VLMs. Popular benchmarks for VLM generalization are further introduced
with thorough performance comparisons among the reviewed methods. Following the
advances in large-scale generalizable pretraining, this survey also discusses
the relations and differences between VLMs and up-to-date multimodal large
language models (MLLM), e.g., DeepSeek-VL. By systematically reviewing the
surging literatures in vision-language research from a novel and practical
generalization prospective, this survey contributes to a clear landscape of
current and future multimodal researches.

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能更好地保留高频信息，显著提升图像修复质量。

Conclusion: 通过频域融合和新型注意力机制，该方法在全局语义与细节保留间取得平衡，为图像修复提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Image inpainting plays a vital role in restoring missing image regions and
supporting high-level vision tasks, but traditional methods struggle with
complex textures and large occlusions. Although Transformer-based approaches
have demonstrated strong global modeling capabilities, they often fail to
preserve high-frequency details due to the low-pass nature of self-attention
and suffer from high computational costs. To address these challenges, this
paper proposes a Transformer-based image inpainting method incorporating
frequency-domain fusion. Specifically, an attention mechanism combining wavelet
transform and Gabor filtering is introduced to enhance multi-scale structural
modeling and detail preservation. Additionally, a learnable frequency-domain
filter based on the fast Fourier transform is designed to replace the
feedforward network, enabling adaptive noise suppression and detail retention.
The model adopts a four-level encoder-decoder structure and is guided by a
novel loss strategy to balance global semantics and fine details. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively improves the quality
of image inpainting by preserving more high-frequency information.

Conclusion: CPAM在复杂图像编辑中表现出色，提供了一种高效且背景保留的解决方案。

Abstract: Editing natural images using textual descriptions in text-to-image diffusion
models remains a significant challenge, particularly in achieving consistent
generation and handling complex, non-rigid objects. Existing methods often
struggle to preserve textures and identity, require extensive fine-tuning, and
exhibit limitations in editing specific spatial regions or objects while
retaining background details. This paper proposes Context-Preserving Adaptive
Manipulation (CPAM), a novel zero-shot framework for complicated, non-rigid
real image editing. Specifically, we propose a preservation adaptation module
that adjusts self-attention mechanisms to preserve and independently control
the object and background effectively. This ensures that the objects' shapes,
textures, and identities are maintained while keeping the background
undistorted during the editing process using the mask guidance technique.
Additionally, we develop a localized extraction module to mitigate the
interference with the non-desired modified regions during conditioning in
cross-attention mechanisms. We also introduce various mask-guidance strategies
to facilitate diverse image manipulation tasks in a simple manner. Extensive
experiments on our newly constructed Image Manipulation BenchmArk (IMBA), a
robust benchmark dataset specifically designed for real image editing,
demonstrate that our proposed method is the preferred choice among human
raters, outperforming existing state-of-the-art editing techniques.

Abstract: Automated pathology report generation from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) faces
two key challenges: (1) lack of semantic content in visual features and (2)
inherent information redundancy in WSIs. To address these issues, we propose a
novel Historical Report Guided \textbf{Bi}-modal Concurrent Learning Framework
for Pathology Report \textbf{Gen}eration (BiGen) emulating pathologists'
diagnostic reasoning, consisting of: (1) A knowledge retrieval mechanism to
provide rich semantic content, which retrieves WSI-relevant knowledge from
pre-built medical knowledge bank by matching high-attention patches and (2) A
bi-modal concurrent learning strategy instantiated via a learnable visual token
and a learnable textual token to dynamically extract key visual features and
retrieved knowledge, where weight-shared layers enable cross-modal alignment
between visual features and knowledge features. Our multi-modal decoder
integrates both modals for comprehensive diagnostic reports generation.
Experiments on the PathText (BRCA) dataset demonstrate our framework's
superiority, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 7.4\% relative
improvement in NLP metrics and 19.1\% enhancement in classification metrics for
Her-2 prediction versus existing methods. Ablation studies validate the
necessity of our proposed modules, highlighting our method's ability to provide
WSI-relevant rich semantic content and suppress information redundancy in WSIs.

Conclusion: DIP为改进密集表示提供了一种简单、无监督且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce DIP, a novel unsupervised post-training method designed to
enhance dense image representations in large-scale pretrained vision encoders
for in-context scene understanding. Unlike prior approaches that rely on
complex self-distillation architectures, our method trains the vision encoder
using pseudo-tasks that explicitly simulate downstream in-context scenarios,
inspired by meta-learning principles. To enable post-training on unlabeled
data, we propose an automatic mechanism for generating in-context tasks that
combines a pretrained diffusion model and the vision encoder itself. DIP is
simple, unsupervised, and computationally efficient, requiring less than 9
hours on a single A100 GPU. By learning dense representations through pseudo
in-context tasks, it achieves strong performance across a wide variety of
downstream real-world in-context scene understanding tasks. It outperforms both
the initial vision encoder and prior methods, offering a practical and
effective solution for improving dense representations. Code available here:

Abstract: Pretraining on large-scale, in-domain datasets grants histopathology
foundation models (FM) the ability to learn task-agnostic data representations,
enhancing transfer learning on downstream tasks. In computational pathology,
automated whole slide image analysis requires multiple instance learning (MIL)
frameworks due to the gigapixel scale of the slides. The diversity among
histopathology FMs has highlighted the need to design real-world challenges for
evaluating their effectiveness. To bridge this gap, our work presents a novel
benchmark for evaluating histopathology FMs as patch-level feature extractors
within a MIL classification framework. For that purpose, we leverage the
AI4SkIN dataset, a multi-center cohort encompassing slides with challenging
cutaneous spindle cell neoplasm subtypes. We also define the Foundation Model -
Silhouette Index (FM-SI), a novel metric to measure model consistency against
distribution shifts. Our experimentation shows that extracting less biased
features enhances classification performance, especially in similarity-based
MIL classifiers.

Abstract: An ideal vision-language agent serves as a bridge between the human users and
their surrounding physical world in real-world applications like autonomous
driving and embodied agents, and proactively provides accurate and timely
responses given user intents. An intriguing challenge arises when agents
interact with the world as a dynamic data stream and ad-hoc queries from users:
supporting knowledge for queries, namely evidence, usually appears
asynchronously with the arrival time of queries, and agents need to ground
their responses in historical data, present observations, and even future
streams. We frame this challenge as Query-Evidence Asynchrony, where user
queries and their supporting evidence typically arrive asynchronously in the
streaming setting. This setting requires not only strong reasoning capabilities
but also the ability to retain past observations and respond to queries with
temporal awareness. In this paper, we introduce a diagnostic benchmark that
evaluates Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on their ability to handle
interaction with streaming data. Further, we present AViLA, Asynchronous
Video-Language Agent for streaming data interaction that can handle ad-hoc
queries and give time-aware responses. For this purpose, AViLA consists of
three key modules: comprehensive memory retention, evidence identification, and
evidence-grounded trigger, that are designed to maintain a general-purpose
memory and respond readily and timely to queries. Our experiments show that
existing models often fail to respond at appropriate times, while AViLA
significantly improves both accuracy and temporal awareness. Our code and
dataset will be publicly available.

Method: 提出CCL框架，结合教师-学生学习和伪标签技术，通过强增强样本和模型重训练提升学习效果。

Result: 实验表明，CCL显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CCL通过上下文一致性学习，有效提升了半监督视频段落定位的性能。

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Video Paragraph Grounding (SSVPG) aims to localize multiple
sentences in a paragraph from an untrimmed video with limited temporal
annotations. Existing methods focus on teacher-student consistency learning and
video-level contrastive loss, but they overlook the importance of perturbing
query contexts to generate strong supervisory signals. In this work, we propose
a novel Context Consistency Learning (CCL) framework that unifies the paradigms
of consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling to enhance semi-supervised
learning. Specifically, we first conduct teacher-student learning where the
student model takes as inputs strongly-augmented samples with sentences removed
and is enforced to learn from the adequately strong supervisory signals from
the teacher model. Afterward, we conduct model retraining based on the
generated pseudo labels, where the mutual agreement between the original and
augmented views' predictions is utilized as the label confidence. Extensive
experiments show that CCL outperforms existing methods by a large margin.

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous driving (AD) have highlighted the potential of
Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) for enhanced environmental perception, particularly
in challenging weather and lighting conditions. However, efficiently processing
its high-dimensional spectral data remains a significant challenge. This paper
introduces a Multi-scale Spectral Attention Module (MSAM) that enhances
spectral feature extraction through three parallel 1D convolutions with varying
kernel sizes between 1 to 11, coupled with an adaptive feature aggregation
mechanism. By integrating MSAM into UNet's skip connections (UNet-SC), our
proposed UNet-MSAM achieves significant improvements in semantic segmentation
performance across multiple HSI datasets: HyKo-VIS v2, HSI-Drive v2, and
Hyperspectral City v2. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that with
minimal computational overhead (on average 0.02% in parameters and 0.82%
GFLOPS), UNet-MSAM consistently outperforms UNet-SC, achieving average
improvements of 3.61% in mean IoU and 3.80% in mF1 across the three datasets.
Through extensive ablation studies, we have established that multi-scale kernel
combinations perform better than single-scale configurations. These findings
demonstrate the potential of HSI processing for AD and provide valuable
insights into designing robust, multi-scale spectral feature extractors for
real-world applications.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了首个公开的H&E-HER2染色数据集HER2match，并比较了GANs和DMs在H&E-HER2染色转换任务中的表现，发现GANs整体优于DMs，仅BBDM表现接近。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决H&E-HER2染色转换任务中缺乏公开数据集和模型性能不明确的问题。

Method: 引入HER2match数据集，比较多种GANs和DMs，并实现了一种新型的BBDM模型。

Result: GANs整体表现优于DMs，BBDM表现接近；数据对齐显著提升模型效果。

Conclusion: HER2match数据集和模型比较为相关研究提供了高质量数据和指导。

Abstract: Virtual staining is a promising technique that uses deep generative models to
recreate histological stains, providing a faster and more cost-effective
alternative to traditional tissue chemical staining. Specifically for H&E-HER2
staining transfer, despite a rising trend in publications, the lack of
sufficient public datasets has hindered progress in the topic. Additionally, it
is currently unclear which model frameworks perform best for this particular
task. In this paper, we introduce the HER2match dataset, the first publicly
available dataset with the same breast cancer tissue sections stained with both
H&E and HER2. Furthermore, we compare the performance of several Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models (DMs), and implement a novel
Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model for H&E-HER2 translation. Our findings indicate
that, overall, GANs perform better than DMs, with only the BBDM achieving
comparable results. Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of data alignment,
as all models trained on HER2match produced vastly improved visuals compared to
the widely used consecutive-slide BCI dataset. This research provides a new
high-quality dataset ([available upon publication acceptance]), improving both
model training and evaluation. In addition, our comparison of frameworks offers
valuable guidance for researchers working on the topic.

Motivation: 解决传统图像分类模型在处理数字化植物标本时因背景复杂、遮挡等问题导致的性能下降。

Method: 采用像素到点的转换生成3D点云，结合CNN和PointNet编码器融合特征。

Result: 在植物标本数据集上，SIM-Net比ResNet101准确率提升9.9%，F-score提升12.3%。

Conclusion: SIM-Net通过融合3D结构信息，显著提升了2D图像分类任务的性能。

Abstract: We introduce the Shape-Image Multimodal Network (SIM-Net), a novel 2D image
classification architecture that integrates 3D point cloud representations
inferred directly from RGB images. Our key contribution lies in a
pixel-to-point transformation that converts 2D object masks into 3D point
clouds, enabling the fusion of texture-based and geometric features for
enhanced classification performance. SIM-Net is particularly well-suited for
the classification of digitized herbarium specimens (a task made challenging by
heterogeneous backgrounds), non-plant elements, and occlusions that compromise
conventional image-based models. To address these issues, SIM-Net employs a
segmentation-based preprocessing step to extract object masks prior to 3D point
cloud generation. The architecture comprises a CNN encoder for 2D image
features and a PointNet-based encoder for geometric features, which are fused
into a unified latent space. Experimental evaluations on herbarium datasets
demonstrate that SIM-Net consistently outperforms ResNet101, achieving gains of
up to 9.9% in accuracy and 12.3% in F-score. It also surpasses several
transformer-based state-of-the-art architectures, highlighting the benefits of
incorporating 3D structural reasoning into 2D image classification tasks.

Conclusion: ShowFlow为单概念和多概念图像生成提供了高效解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Customizing image generation remains a core challenge in controllable image
synthesis. For single-concept generation, maintaining both identity
preservation and prompt alignment is challenging. In multi-concept scenarios,
relying solely on a prompt without additional conditions like layout boxes or
semantic masks, often leads to identity loss and concept omission. In this
paper, we introduce ShowFlow, a comprehensive framework designed to tackle
these challenges. We propose ShowFlow-S for single-concept image generation,
and ShowFlow-M for handling multiple concepts. ShowFlow-S introduces a
KronA-WED adapter, which integrates a Kronecker adapter with weight and
embedding decomposition, and employs a disentangled learning approach with a
novel attention regularization objective to enhance single-concept generation.
Building on this foundation, ShowFlow-M directly reuses the learned models from
ShowFlow-S to support multi-concept generation without extra conditions,
incorporating a Subject-Adaptive Matching Attention (SAMA) and a layout
consistency strategy as the plug-and-play module. Extensive experiments and
user studies validate ShowFlow's effectiveness, highlighting its potential in
real-world applications like advertising and virtual dressing.

Abstract: We introduce Matrix-Game, an interactive world foundation model for
controllable game world generation. Matrix-Game is trained using a two-stage
pipeline that first performs large-scale unlabeled pretraining for environment
understanding, followed by action-labeled training for interactive video
generation. To support this, we curate Matrix-Game-MC, a comprehensive
Minecraft dataset comprising over 2,700 hours of unlabeled gameplay video clips
and over 1,000 hours of high-quality labeled clips with fine-grained keyboard
and mouse action annotations. Our model adopts a controllable image-to-world
generation paradigm, conditioned on a reference image, motion context, and user
actions. With over 17 billion parameters, Matrix-Game enables precise control
over character actions and camera movements, while maintaining high visual
quality and temporal coherence. To evaluate performance, we develop GameWorld
Score, a unified benchmark measuring visual quality, temporal quality, action
controllability, and physical rule understanding for Minecraft world
generation. Extensive experiments show that Matrix-Game consistently
outperforms prior open-source Minecraft world models (including Oasis and
MineWorld) across all metrics, with particularly strong gains in
controllability and physical consistency. Double-blind human evaluations
further confirm the superiority of Matrix-Game, highlighting its ability to
generate perceptually realistic and precisely controllable videos across
diverse game scenarios. To facilitate future research on interactive
image-to-world generation, we will open-source the Matrix-Game model weights
and the GameWorld Score benchmark at https://github.com/SkyworkAI/Matrix-Game.

Motivation: 传统知识蒸馏在长尾数据分布中表现不佳，因为教师模型对头部类别有偏见，导致尾部类别监督不足。

Result: 在多个数据集上，LTKD显著优于现有KD方法，整体准确率和尾部类别性能均有提升。

Conclusion: LTKD能够有效从有偏见的教师模型中转移知识，适用于资源受限和不平衡的实际场景。

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a widely adopted model compression technique
where a compact student model learns from the output of a larger, pre-trained
teacher. While effective in balanced settings, conventional KD suffers
significantly when applied to long-tailed data distributions, as the teacher
model tends to be biased toward head classes and provides limited supervision
for tail classes. In this paper, we propose Long-Tailed Knowledge Distillation
(LTKD), a novel framework tailored for class-imbalanced scenarios. We begin by
reformulating the standard KD objective into two components: inter-group and
intra-group Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, corresponding to the prediction
distributions across and within class groups (head, medium, tail),
respectively. This decomposition allows us to identify and quantify the sources
of teacher bias. To address them, we introduce (1) a rebalanced inter-group
loss that calibrates the teacher's group-level predictions and (2) a uniform
intra-group loss that ensures equal contribution from all groups during
distillation. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100-LT, TinyImageNet-LT, and
ImageNet-LT show that LTKD consistently outperforms existing KD methods,
achieving significant gains in both overall accuracy and tail-class
performance. Our results demonstrate that LTKD enables effective knowledge
transfer even from biased teachers, making it a strong candidate for real-world
deployment in resource-constrained and imbalanced settings.

Result: 深度CNN模型支持可撤销生物识别，模板不兼容性强；Vision Transformer表现不佳。

Conclusion: 深度CNN是实现可撤销生物识别的有效方法，而Vision Transformer不适用。

Abstract: One common critique of biometric authentication is that if an individual's
biometric is compromised, then the individual has no recourse. The concept of
revocable biometrics was developed to address this concern. A biometric scheme
is revocable if an individual can have their current enrollment in the scheme
revoked, so that the compromised biometric template becomes worthless, and the
individual can re-enroll with a new template that has similar recognition
power. We show that modern deep CNN face matchers inherently allow for a robust
revocable biometric scheme. For a given state-of-the-art deep CNN backbone and
training set, it is possible to generate an unlimited number of distinct face
matcher models that have both (1) equivalent recognition power, and (2)
strongly incompatible biometric templates. The equivalent recognition power
extends to the point of generating impostor and genuine distributions that have
the same shape and placement on the similarity dimension, meaning that the
models can share a similarity threshold for a 1-in-10,000 false match rate. The
biometric templates from different model instances are so strongly incompatible
that the cross-instance similarity score for images of the same person is
typically lower than the same-instance similarity score for images of different
persons. That is, a stolen biometric template that is revoked is of less value
in attempting to match the re-enrolled identity than the average impostor
template. We also explore the feasibility of using a Vision Transformer (ViT)
backbone-based face matcher in the revocable biometric system proposed in this
work and demonstrate that it is less suitable compared to typical ResNet-based
deep CNN backbones.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable multi-disease diagnosis remains a critical
challenge in medical research, particularly when leveraging heterogeneous
multimodal medical data. Current approaches often rely on single-modal data,
limiting their ability to comprehensively understand complex diseases. To
address this, we propose MedTVT-R1, a novel Multimodal Large Language Model
(MLLM) framework designed to integrate clinical multimodal data for reasoning
and diagnosing multiple diseases. We construct MedTVT-QA, a curated instruction
dataset that provides question-answer pairs for physiological-level
interpretations and disease-level diagnoses with a Chain of Evidence approach.
MedTVT-R1 incorporates a modality perception layer to capture inter-modal
dependencies and adaptively weight modality contributions. Additionally, we
employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)-based Reinforcement
Fine-Tuning with a Jaccard Reward function to enhance diagnostic reasoning.
Experimental results demonstrate MedTVT-R1's superiority in multimodal feature
utilization and multi-disease diagnosis, offering significant potential for
clinical applications such as diagnostic report generation and comorbidity
reasoning. The dataset and code are available at

Conclusion: SWA通过显式建模空间结构，有效解决了稀疏或遮挡区域的感知问题，具有跨模态的通用性。

Abstract: Perception systems in autonomous driving rely on sensors such as LiDAR and
cameras to perceive the 3D environment. However, due to occlusions and data
sparsity, these sensors often fail to capture complete information. Semantic
Occupancy Prediction (SOP) addresses this challenge by inferring both occupancy
and semantics of unobserved regions. Existing transformer-based SOP methods
lack explicit modeling of spatial structure in attention computation, resulting
in limited geometric awareness and poor performance in sparse or occluded
areas. To this end, we propose Spatially-aware Window Attention (SWA), a novel
mechanism that incorporates local spatial context into attention. SWA
significantly improves scene completion and achieves state-of-the-art results
on LiDAR-based SOP benchmarks. We further validate its generality by
integrating SWA into a camera-based SOP pipeline, where it also yields
consistent gains across modalities.

Conclusion: TEAFormer通过创新的自适应机制成功解决了翻译等变性问题，为图像修复提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Translation equivariance is a fundamental inductive bias in image
restoration, ensuring that translated inputs produce translated outputs.
Attention mechanisms in modern restoration transformers undermine this
property, adversely impacting both training convergence and generalization. To
alleviate this issue, we propose two key strategies for incorporating
translation equivariance: slide indexing and component stacking. Slide indexing
maintains operator responses at fixed positions, with sliding window attention
being a notable example, while component stacking enables the arrangement of
translation-equivariant operators in parallel or sequentially, thereby building
complex architectures while preserving translation equivariance. However, these
strategies still create a dilemma in model design between the high
computational cost of self-attention and the fixed receptive field associated
with sliding window attention. To address this, we develop an adaptive sliding
indexing mechanism to efficiently select key-value pairs for each query, which
are then concatenated in parallel with globally aggregated key-value pairs. The
designed network, called the Translation Equivariance Adaptive Transformer
(TEAFormer), is assessed across a variety of image restoration tasks. The
results highlight its superiority in terms of effectiveness, training
convergence, and generalization.

Conclusion: OC-SOP通过对象中心的方法有效解决了传统方法的局限性，为自动驾驶感知提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous driving perception faces significant challenges due to occlusions
and incomplete scene data in the environment. To overcome these issues, the
task of semantic occupancy prediction (SOP) is proposed, which aims to jointly
infer both the geometry and semantic labels of a scene from images. However,
conventional camera-based methods typically treat all categories equally and
primarily rely on local features, leading to suboptimal predictions, especially
for dynamic foreground objects. To address this, we propose Object-Centric SOP
(OC-SOP), a framework that integrates high-level object-centric cues extracted
via a detection branch into the semantic occupancy prediction pipeline. This
object-centric integration significantly enhances the prediction accuracy for
foreground objects and achieves state-of-the-art performance among all
categories on SemanticKITTI.

Abstract: Generating multi-view images from human instructions is crucial for 3D
content creation. The primary challenges involve maintaining consistency across
multiple views and effectively synthesizing shapes and textures under diverse
conditions. In this paper, we propose the Multi-View Auto-Regressive (MV-AR)
method, which leverages an auto-regressive model to progressively generate
consistent multi-view images from arbitrary prompts. Firstly, the
next-token-prediction capability of the AR model significantly enhances its
effectiveness in facilitating progressive multi-view synthesis. When generating
widely-separated views, MV-AR can utilize all its preceding views to extract
effective reference information. Subsequently, we propose a unified model that
accommodates various prompts via architecture designing and training
strategies. To address multiple conditions, we introduce condition injection
modules for text, camera pose, image, and shape. To manage multi-modal
conditions simultaneously, a progressive training strategy is employed. This
strategy initially adopts the text-to-multi-view (t2mv) model as a baseline to
enhance the development of a comprehensive X-to-multi-view (X2mv) model through
the randomly dropping and combining conditions. Finally, to alleviate the
overfitting problem caused by limited high-quality data, we propose the
"Shuffle View" data augmentation technique, thus significantly expanding the
training data by several magnitudes. Experiments demonstrate the performance
and versatility of our MV-AR, which consistently generates consistent
multi-view images across a range of conditions and performs on par with leading
diffusion-based multi-view image generation models. Code and models will be

Conclusion: HS2SD能更细致地建模双曲集合间的层次和复杂关系。

Abstract: We propose a hyperbolic set-to-set distance measure for computing
dissimilarity between sets in hyperbolic space. While point-to-point distances
in hyperbolic space effectively capture hierarchical relationships between data
points, many real-world applications require comparing sets of hyperbolic data
points, where the local structure and the global structure of the sets carry
crucial semantic information. The proposed the \underline{h}yperbolic
\underline{s}et-\underline{to}-\underline{s}et \underline{d}istance measure
(HS2SD) integrates both global and local structural information: global
structure through geodesic distances between Einstein midpoints of hyperbolic
sets, and local structure through topological characteristics of the two sets.
To efficiently compute topological differences, we prove that using a finite
Thue-Morse sequence of degree and adjacency matrices can serve as a robust
approximation to capture the topological structure of a set. In this case, by
considering the topological differences, HS2SD provides a more nuanced
understanding of the relationships between two hyperbolic sets. Empirical
evaluation on entity matching, standard image classification, and few-shot
image classification demonstrates that our distance measure outperforms
existing methods by effectively modeling the hierarchical and complex
relationships inherent in hyperbolic sets.

Abstract: Learning in hyperbolic spaces has attracted increasing attention due to its
superior ability to model hierarchical structures of data. Most existing
hyperbolic learning methods use fixed distance measures for all data, assuming
a uniform hierarchy across all data points. However, real-world hierarchical
structures exhibit significant diversity, making this assumption overly
restrictive. In this paper, we propose a geometry-aware distance measure in
hyperbolic spaces, which dynamically adapts to varying hierarchical structures.
Our approach derives the distance measure by generating tailored projections
and curvatures for each pair of data points, effectively mapping them to an
appropriate hyperbolic space. We introduce a revised low-rank decomposition
scheme and a hard-pair mining mechanism to mitigate the computational cost of
pair-wise distance computation without compromising accuracy. We present an
upper bound on the low-rank approximation error using Talagrand's concentration
inequality, ensuring theoretical robustness. Extensive experiments on standard
image classification (MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100), hierarchical
classification (5-level CIFAR-100), and few-shot learning tasks (mini-ImageNet,
tiered-ImageNet) demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our approach
consistently outperforms learning methods that use fixed distance measures,
with notable improvements on few-shot learning tasks, where it achieves over
5\% gains on mini-ImageNet. The results reveal that adaptive distance measures
better capture diverse hierarchical structures, with visualization showing
clearer class boundaries and improved prototype separation in hyperbolic
spaces.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有多模态大语言模型在卫星图像时间序列分析中时空推理能力不足的问题。

Method: 提出TAMMs模型，结合轻量级时间模块和语义融合控制注入机制（SFCI），增强ControlNet的双路径条件生成。

Result: TAMMs在时间变化理解和未来图像预测任务中表现优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 精心设计的时间推理和语义融合能充分发挥多模态大语言模型在时空理解中的潜力。

Abstract: Satellite image time-series analysis demands fine-grained spatial-temporal
reasoning, which remains a challenge for existing multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). In this work, we study the capabilities of MLLMs on a novel
task that jointly targets temporal change understanding and future scene
generation, aiming to assess their potential for modeling complex multimodal
dynamics over time. We propose TAMMs, a Temporal-Aware Multimodal Model for
satellite image change understanding and forecasting, which enhances frozen
MLLMs with lightweight temporal modules for structured sequence encoding and
contextual prompting. To guide future image generation, TAMMs introduces a
Semantic-Fused Control Injection (SFCI) mechanism that adaptively combines
high-level semantic reasoning and structural priors within an enhanced
ControlNet. This dual-path conditioning enables temporally consistent and
semantically grounded image synthesis. Experiments demonstrate that TAMMs
outperforms strong MLLM baselines in both temporal change understanding and
future image forecasting tasks, highlighting how carefully designed temporal
reasoning and semantic fusion can unlock the full potential of MLLMs for
spatio-temporal understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于多语义融合网络的无监督异常检测方法，通过引入正常样本的多语义特征来改进逻辑异常的检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 逻辑异常检测比结构异常更具挑战性，现有方法在低维瓶颈中可能无法有效抑制异常传播，导致重建效果误导。

Method: 使用预训练的视觉语言网络提取正常样本的全局语义，构建可学习的语义码本，并通过多语义特征融合指导解码器重建。

Result: 在MVTec LOCO AD数据集上表现优异，pixel-sPRO提升5.7%，image-AUROC提升2.6%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过多语义特征融合有效改善了逻辑异常检测性能，达到了SOTA水平。

Abstract: Recently, detecting logical anomalies is becoming a more challenging task
compared to detecting structural ones. Existing encoder decoder based methods
typically compress inputs into low-dimensional bottlenecks on the assumption
that the compression process can effectively suppress the transmission of
logical anomalies to the decoder. However, logical anomalies present a
particular difficulty because, while their local features often resemble normal
semantics, their global semantics deviate significantly from normal patterns.
Thanks to the generalisation capabilities inherent in neural networks, these
abnormal semantic features can propagate through low-dimensional bottlenecks.
This ultimately allows the decoder to reconstruct anomalous images with
misleading fidelity. To tackle the above challenge, we propose a novel
normality prior guided multi-semantic fusion network for unsupervised anomaly
detection. Instead of feeding the compressed bottlenecks to the decoder
directly, we introduce the multi-semantic features of normal samples into the
reconstruction process. To this end, we first extract abstract global semantics
of normal cases by a pre-trained vision-language network, then the learnable
semantic codebooks are constructed to store representative feature vectors of
normal samples by vector quantisation. Finally, the above multi-semantic
features are fused and employed as input to the decoder to guide the
reconstruction of anomalies to approximate normality. Extensive experiments are
conducted to validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, and it achieves
the SOTA performance on the MVTec LOCO AD dataset with improvements of 5.7% in
pixel-sPRO and 2.6% in image-AUROC. The source code is available at

TL;DR: OmniAvatar是一个创新的音频驱动全身视频生成模型，通过多层级音频嵌入策略和LoRA训练方法，提升了唇同步精度和自然动作，优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注面部动作，难以生成自然同步的全身动画，且缺乏精细提示控制。

Method: 采用像素级多层级音频嵌入策略和LoRA训练方法，结合音频特征与基础模型的提示控制能力。

Result: 实验表明，OmniAvatar在面部和半身视频生成中优于现有模型，支持精确的文本控制。

Conclusion: OmniAvatar为音频驱动全身动画提供了高效解决方案，适用于多种场景。

Abstract: Significant progress has been made in audio-driven human animation, while
most existing methods focus mainly on facial movements, limiting their ability
to create full-body animations with natural synchronization and fluidity. They
also struggle with precise prompt control for fine-grained generation. To
tackle these challenges, we introduce OmniAvatar, an innovative audio-driven
full-body video generation model that enhances human animation with improved
lip-sync accuracy and natural movements. OmniAvatar introduces a pixel-wise
multi-hierarchical audio embedding strategy to better capture audio features in
the latent space, enhancing lip-syncing across diverse scenes. To preserve the
capability for prompt-driven control of foundation models while effectively
incorporating audio features, we employ a LoRA-based training approach.
Extensive experiments show that OmniAvatar surpasses existing models in both
facial and semi-body video generation, offering precise text-based control for
creating videos in various domains, such as podcasts, human interactions,
dynamic scenes, and singing. Our project page is

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的声源定位框架，通过生成细粒度上下文信息区分发声物体与静默物体，并引入两种新损失函数（OCA和ORI），显著提升了复杂场景中的定位性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在复杂场景中难以准确区分发声物体与视觉相似的静默物体，主要依赖简单的视听对应关系，缺乏语义区分能力。

Method: 利用MLLMs生成细粒度上下文信息，结合新提出的OCA和ORI损失函数，增强发声物体与静默物体的区分能力。

Result: 在MUSIC和VGG-Sound数据集上显著优于现有方法，适用于单源和多源定位场景。

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过细粒度语义区分和新损失函数，有效解决了复杂场景中的声源定位问题。

Abstract: Audio-visual sound source localization task aims to spatially localize
sound-making objects within visual scenes by integrating visual and audio cues.
However, existing methods struggle with accurately localizing sound-making
objects in complex scenes, particularly when visually similar silent objects
coexist. This limitation arises primarily from their reliance on simple
audio-visual correspondence, which does not capture fine-grained semantic
differences between sound-making and silent objects. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel sound source localization framework leveraging
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to generate detailed contextual
information that explicitly distinguishes between sound-making foreground
objects and silent background objects. To effectively integrate this detailed
information, we introduce two novel loss functions: Object-aware Contrastive
Alignment (OCA) loss and Object Region Isolation (ORI) loss. Extensive
experimental results on MUSIC and VGGSound datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach, significantly outperforming existing methods in
both single-source and multi-source localization scenarios. Code and generated
detailed contextual information are available at:

TL;DR: VQ-Insight是一个新颖的推理式视觉语言模型框架，用于评估AI生成视频的质量，通过渐进式学习和多维度奖励设计，显著提升了评估性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI生成视频质量评估存在泛化性差、缺乏时间意识、依赖标注数据等问题，需要更有效的评估方法。

Method: 提出VQ-Insight框架，结合图像质量预热、任务特定时间学习和联合优化，设计多维度评分奖励和偏好比较奖励。

Result: 实验表明VQ-Insight在多维度评分、偏好比较和自然视频评分中均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: VQ-Insight为视频生成任务提供了显著改进，解决了现有评估方法的局限性。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-generated content (AIGC) have led to the emergence of
powerful text-to-video generation models. Despite these successes, evaluating
the quality of AIGC-generated videos remains challenging due to limited
generalization, lack of temporal awareness, heavy reliance on large-scale
annotated datasets, and the lack of effective interaction with generation
models. Most current approaches rely on supervised finetuning of
vision-language models (VLMs), which often require large-scale annotated
datasets and tend to decouple understanding and generation. To address these
shortcomings, we propose VQ-Insight, a novel reasoning-style VLM framework for
AIGC video quality assessment. Our approach features: (1) a progressive video
quality learning scheme that combines image quality warm-up, general
task-specific temporal learning, and joint optimization with the video
generation model; (2) the design of multi-dimension scoring rewards, preference
comparison rewards, and temporal modeling rewards to enhance both
generalization and specialization in video quality evaluation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that VQ-Insight consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in preference comparison, multi-dimension scoring,
and natural video scoring, bringing significant improvements for video
generation tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisualChef是一种生成烹饪场景上下文视觉辅助的方法，通过基于掩码的视觉定位简化对齐，生成动作执行和结果图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 烹饪过程中缺乏一致的视觉指导，现有方法依赖复杂文本对齐和额外标注。

Method: 通过识别动作相关对象并分类，实现针对性修改，同时提出自动化管道提取高质量帧。

Result: 在三个第一人称视频数据集上定量和定性评估，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: VisualChef简化视觉辅助生成，提升烹饪指导效果。

Abstract: Cooking requires not only following instructions but also understanding,
executing, and monitoring each step - a process that can be challenging without
visual guidance. Although recipe images and videos offer helpful cues, they
often lack consistency in focus, tools, and setup. To better support the
cooking process, we introduce VisualChef, a method for generating contextual
visual aids tailored to cooking scenarios. Given an initial frame and a
specified action, VisualChef generates images depicting both the action's
execution and the resulting appearance of the object, while preserving the
initial frame's environment. Previous work aims to integrate knowledge
extracted from large language models by generating detailed textual
descriptions to guide image generation, which requires fine-grained
visual-textual alignment and involves additional annotations. In contrast,
VisualChef simplifies alignment through mask-based visual grounding. Our key
insight is identifying action-relevant objects and classifying them to enable
targeted modifications that reflect the intended action and outcome while
maintaining a consistent environment. In addition, we propose an automated
pipeline to extract high-quality initial, action, and final state frames. We
evaluate VisualChef quantitatively and qualitatively on three egocentric video
datasets and show its improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D高斯基元在渲染速度和高级渲染效果（如重新光照和阴影渲染）上的不足，同时保留连续体积建模的优势。

Method: 使用2D三角形面片形成离散的类网格结构，引入紧凑性参数直接训练网格，实现高保真度和视觉质量。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保真度上优于现有高斯基元方法，且在网格重建质量上优于现有网格重建方法。

Conclusion: 2DTS方法在渲染速度和视觉效果上均优于现有方法，为3D场景重建提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Differentiable rendering with 3D Gaussian primitives has emerged as a
powerful method for reconstructing high-fidelity 3D scenes from multi-view
images. While it offers improvements over NeRF-based methods, this
representation still encounters challenges with rendering speed and advanced
rendering effects, such as relighting and shadow rendering, compared to
mesh-based models. In this paper, we propose 2D Triangle Splatting (2DTS), a
novel method that replaces 3D Gaussian primitives with 2D triangle facelets.
This representation naturally forms a discrete mesh-like structure while
retaining the benefits of continuous volumetric modeling. By incorporating a
compactness parameter into the triangle primitives, we enable direct training
of photorealistic meshes. Our experimental results demonstrate that our
triangle-based method, in its vanilla version (without compactness tuning),
achieves higher fidelity compared to state-of-the-art Gaussian-based methods.
Furthermore, our approach produces reconstructed meshes with superior visual
quality compared to existing mesh reconstruction methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于卫星图像时间序列（SITS）中大量未标记数据和少量标记数据的矛盾，需要一种有效的自监督学习方法利用未标记数据。

Method: 提出了一种新的重采样增强策略，通过上采样时间序列并提取不重叠子序列来生成正样本对，保留时间覆盖范围。

Result: 在多个农业分类基准测试中表现优于传统方法（如抖动、调整大小和掩码），并在S2-Agri100数据集上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为遥感时间序列提供了一种简单而有效的对比学习增强策略。

Abstract: Given the abundance of unlabeled Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) and the
scarcity of labeled data, contrastive self-supervised pretraining emerges as a
natural tool to leverage this vast quantity of unlabeled data. However,
designing effective data augmentations for contrastive learning remains
challenging for time series. We introduce a novel resampling-based augmentation
strategy that generates positive pairs by upsampling time series and extracting
disjoint subsequences while preserving temporal coverage. We validate our
approach on multiple agricultural classification benchmarks using Sentinel-2
imagery, showing that it outperforms common alternatives such as jittering,
resizing, and masking. Further, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the
S2-Agri100 dataset without employing spatial information or temporal encodings,
surpassing more complex masked-based SSL frameworks. Our method offers a
simple, yet effective, contrastive learning augmentation for remote sensing
time series.

TL;DR: SpaNN是一种新型的对抗性攻击检测器，其计算复杂度与对抗性补丁数量无关，通过构建二值化特征图集合和聚类方法实现高效检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法主要针对单补丁攻击，对多补丁攻击效果不佳或计算效率低下，SpaNN旨在解决这一问题。

Method: SpaNN通过应用一组显著性阈值对受害者模型的第一个卷积层激活生成二值化特征图集合，并进行聚类，将聚类特征输入分类器进行攻击检测。

Result: 在四个数据集上的实验表明，SpaNN在目标检测和图像分类任务中分别比现有方法提升了11和27个百分点。

Conclusion: SpaNN在多补丁攻击检测中表现出色，且计算效率高，为对抗性攻击防御提供了新思路。

Abstract: State-of-the-art convolutional neural network models for object detection and
image classification are vulnerable to physically realizable adversarial
perturbations, such as patch attacks. Existing defenses have focused,
implicitly or explicitly, on single-patch attacks, leaving their sensitivity to
the number of patches as an open question or rendering them computationally
infeasible or inefficient against attacks consisting of multiple patches in the
worst cases. In this work, we propose SpaNN, an attack detector whose
computational complexity is independent of the expected number of adversarial
patches. The key novelty of the proposed detector is that it builds an ensemble
of binarized feature maps by applying a set of saliency thresholds to the
neural activations of the first convolutional layer of the victim model. It
then performs clustering on the ensemble and uses the cluster features as the
input to a classifier for attack detection. Contrary to existing detectors,
SpaNN does not rely on a fixed saliency threshold for identifying adversarial
regions, which makes it robust against white box adversarial attacks. We
evaluate SpaNN on four widely used data sets for object detection and
classification, and our results show that SpaNN outperforms state-of-the-art
defenses by up to 11 and 27 percentage points in the case of object detection
and the case of image classification, respectively. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有视频生成技术在视觉质量上进步显著，但在真实物理一致性上仍有不足，且基于偏好的后训练方法成本高。

Result: RDPO显著提升了生成视频的动作连贯性和物理真实感，在多个基准测试和人类评估中表现优异。

Conclusion: RDPO通过利用真实视频动态信息，为视频生成提供了更高效的物理一致性优化方案。

Abstract: Video generation techniques have achieved remarkable advancements in visual
quality, yet faithfully reproducing real-world physics remains elusive.
Preference-based model post-training may improve physical consistency, but
requires costly human-annotated datasets or reward models that are not yet
feasible. To address these challenges, we present Real Data Preference
Optimisation (RDPO), an annotation-free framework that distills physical priors
directly from real-world videos. Specifically, the proposed RDPO
reverse-samples real video sequences with a pre-trained generator to
automatically build preference pairs that are statistically distinguishable in
terms of physical correctness. A multi-stage iterative training schedule then
guides the generator to obey physical laws increasingly well. Benefiting from
the dynamic information explored from real videos, our proposed RDPO
significantly improves the action coherence and physical realism of the
generated videos. Evaluations on multiple benchmarks and human evaluations have
demonstrated that RDPO achieves improvements across multiple dimensions. The
source code and demonstration of this paper are available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割面临边界模糊和类别不平衡的挑战，现有方法依赖局部线索或用户提示，缺乏语义先验，难以处理低对比度或重叠目标。

Method: MedSeg-R分为认知阶段和感知阶段：认知阶段从医学报告中提取结构化语义先验（位置、纹理、形状），感知阶段通过空间注意力、动态卷积和可变形采样调制SAM模型。

Result: MedSeg-R在重叠和模糊结构的分割中显著提升了Dice分数，对小病灶的敏感性大幅提高。

Conclusion: MedSeg-R通过嵌入细粒度语义先验，有效解决了医学图像分割中的挑战，并展示了与SAM系统的兼容性。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is challenging due to overlapping anatomies with
ambiguous boundaries and a severe imbalance between the foreground and
background classes, which particularly affects the delineation of small
lesions. Existing methods, including encoder-decoder networks and prompt-driven
variants of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), rely heavily on local cues or
user prompts and lack integrated semantic priors, thus failing to generalize
well to low-contrast or overlapping targets. To address these issues, we
propose MedSeg-R, a lightweight, dual-stage framework inspired by inspired by
clinical reasoning. Its cognitive stage interprets medical report into
structured semantic priors (location, texture, shape), which are fused via
transformer block. In the perceptual stage, these priors modulate the SAM
backbone: spatial attention highlights likely lesion regions, dynamic
convolution adapts feature filters to expected textures, and deformable
sampling refines spatial support. By embedding this fine-grained guidance
early, MedSeg-R disentangles inter-class confusion and amplifies minority-class
cues, greatly improving sensitivity to small lesions. In challenging
benchmarks, MedSeg-R produces large Dice improvements in overlapping and
ambiguous structures, demonstrating plug-and-play compatibility with SAM-based
systems.

Conclusion: 提出的框架和数据集推动了SLAM、3D重建和视觉基础模型的研究发展。

Abstract: Neural implicit scene representations have recently shown promising results
in dense visual SLAM. However, existing implicit SLAM algorithms are
constrained to single-agent scenarios, and fall difficulties in large-scale
scenes and long sequences. Existing NeRF-based multi-agent SLAM frameworks
cannot meet the constraints of communication bandwidth. To this end, we propose
the first distributed multi-agent collaborative neural SLAM framework with
hybrid scene representation, distributed camera tracking, intra-to-inter loop
closure, and online distillation for multiple submap fusion. A novel
triplane-grid joint scene representation method is proposed to improve scene
reconstruction. A novel intra-to-inter loop closure method is designed to
achieve local (single-agent) and global (multi-agent) consistency. We also
design a novel online distillation method to fuse the information of different
submaps to achieve global consistency. Furthermore, to the best of our
knowledge, there is no real-world dataset for NeRF-based/GS-based SLAM that
provides both continuous-time trajectories groundtruth and high-accuracy 3D
meshes groundtruth. To this end, we propose the first real-world Dense slam
(DES) dataset covering both single-agent and multi-agent scenarios, ranging
from small rooms to large-scale outdoor scenes, with high-accuracy ground truth
for both 3D mesh and continuous-time camera trajectory. This dataset can
advance the development of the research in both SLAM, 3D reconstruction, and
visual foundation model. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method in both mapping, tracking, and
communication. The dataset and code will open-source on

Result: 在五个医学影像数据集上表现出色，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: MARL-MambaContour是一种准确且鲁棒的临床分割工具。

Abstract: We introduce MARL-MambaContour, the first contour-based medical image
segmentation framework based on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). Our
approach reframes segmentation as a multi-agent cooperation task focused on
generate topologically consistent object-level contours, addressing the
limitations of traditional pixel-based methods which could lack topological
constraints and holistic structural awareness of anatomical regions. Each
contour point is modeled as an autonomous agent that iteratively adjusts its
position to align precisely with the target boundary, enabling adaptation to
blurred edges and intricate morphologies common in medical images. This
iterative adjustment process is optimized by a contour-specific Soft
Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm, further enhanced with the Entropy Regularization
Adjustment Mechanism (ERAM) which dynamically balance agent exploration with
contour smoothness. Furthermore, the framework incorporates a Mamba-based
policy network featuring a novel Bidirectional Cross-attention Hidden-state
Fusion Mechanism (BCHFM). This mechanism mitigates potential memory confusion
limitations associated with long-range modeling in state space models, thereby
facilitating more accurate inter-agent information exchange and informed
decision-making. Extensive experiments on five diverse medical imaging datasets
demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of MARL-MambaContour, highlighting
its potential as an accurate and robust clinical application.

Abstract: Effective human action recognition is widely used for cobots in Industry 4.0

In this work, we introduce a novel approach to skeleton-based action
recognition that enriches input representations by leveraging word embeddings

semantic volumes, enabling the model to capture meaningful relationships
between joints and objects. Through extensive experiments on multiple assembly
datasets, we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves
classification performance, and enhances generalization capabilities by
simultaneously supporting different skeleton types and object classes. Our
findings highlight the potential of incorporating semantic information to

Abstract: Object tracking in inland waterways plays a crucial role in safe and
cost-effective applications, including waterborne transportation, sightseeing
tours, environmental monitoring and surface rescue. Our Unmanned Surface
Vehicle (USV), equipped with a 4D radar, a monocular camera, a GPS, and an IMU,
delivers robust tracking capabilities in complex waterborne environments. By
leveraging these sensors, our USV collected comprehensive object tracking data,
which we present as USVTrack, the first 4D radar-camera tracking dataset
tailored for autonomous driving in new generation waterborne transportation
systems. Our USVTrack dataset presents rich scenarios, featuring diverse
various waterways, varying times of day, and multiple weather and lighting
conditions. Moreover, we present a simple but effective radar-camera matching
method, termed RCM, which can be plugged into popular two-stage association
trackers. Experimental results utilizing RCM demonstrate the effectiveness of
the radar-camera matching in improving object tracking accuracy and reliability
for autonomous driving in waterborne environments. The USVTrack dataset is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3D Arena是一个开放平台，通过大规模人类偏好收集评估图像到3D生成模型，填补了自动化指标与人类感知之间的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法在3D生成模型的质量评估上存在不足，无法同时兼顾3D结构和感知吸引力。

Method: 利用成对比较收集人类偏好数据，结合统计欺诈检测和ELO排名系统进行模型评估。

Result: 收集了123,243票用户偏好数据，发现高斯溅射输出和带纹理模型更受青睐，并提出了改进评估方法的建议。

Conclusion: 3D Arena成为生成3D领域的重要评估资源，推动了以人为中心的评估方法的发展。

Abstract: Evaluating Generative 3D models remains challenging due to misalignment
between automated metrics and human perception of quality. Current benchmarks
rely on image-based metrics that ignore 3D structure or geometric measures that
fail to capture perceptual appeal and real-world utility. To address this gap,
we present 3D Arena, an open platform for evaluating image-to-3D generation
models through large-scale human preference collection using pairwise
comparisons.
  Since launching in June 2024, the platform has collected 123,243 votes from
8,096 users across 19 state-of-the-art models, establishing the largest human
preference evaluation for Generative 3D. We contribute the iso3d dataset of 100
evaluation prompts and demonstrate quality control achieving 99.75% user
authenticity through statistical fraud detection. Our ELO-based ranking system
provides reliable model assessment, with the platform becoming an established
evaluation resource.
  Through analysis of this preference data, we present insights into human
preference patterns. Our findings reveal preferences for visual presentation
features, with Gaussian splat outputs achieving a 16.6 ELO advantage over
meshes and textured models receiving a 144.1 ELO advantage over untextured
models. We provide recommendations for improving evaluation methods, including
multi-criteria assessment, task-oriented evaluation, and format-aware
comparison. The platform's community engagement establishes 3D Arena as a
benchmark for the field while advancing understanding of human-centered
evaluation in Generative 3D.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的Super-Pixel Based Patch Pooling (SPPP)技术和Light Latent Attention (LLA)模块，以减少Vision Transformers的计算和内存需求，提高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Vision Transformers在预训练和任务迁移学习中依赖大量计算资源和内存的问题，以及自注意力机制的高能耗问题。

Method: 提出SPPP生成语义丰富的补丁嵌入，减少架构复杂性；引入LLA模块，通过潜在令牌集成降低注意力模块的时间和空间复杂度。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提高了计算效率，同时保持了与现有先进方法相当的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为边缘部署提供了高效的Transformer解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The evolution of Vision Transformers has led to their widespread adaptation
to different domains. Despite large-scale success, there remain significant
challenges including their reliance on extensive computational and memory
resources for pre-training on huge datasets as well as difficulties in
task-specific transfer learning. These limitations coupled with energy
inefficiencies mainly arise due to the computation-intensive self-attention
mechanism. To address these issues, we propose a novel Super-Pixel Based Patch
Pooling (SPPP) technique that generates context-aware, semantically rich, patch
embeddings to effectively reduce the architectural complexity and improve
efficiency. Additionally, we introduce the Light Latent Attention (LLA) module
in our pipeline by integrating latent tokens into the attention mechanism
allowing cross-attention operations to significantly reduce the time and space
complexity of the attention module. By leveraging the data-intuitive patch
embeddings coupled with dynamic positional encodings, our approach adaptively
modulates the cross-attention process to focus on informative regions while
maintaining the global semantic structure. This targeted attention improves
training efficiency and accelerates convergence. Notably, the SPPP module is
lightweight and can be easily integrated into existing transformer
architectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed architecture
provides significant improvements in terms of computational efficiency while
achieving comparable results with the state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting
its potential for energy-efficient transformers suitable for edge deployment.

Result: 在DyCheck基准测试中，ViDAR在视觉质量和几何一致性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ViDAR在动态区域表现优异，为运动丰富场景的重建提供了新基准。

Abstract: Dynamic Novel View Synthesis aims to generate photorealistic views of moving
subjects from arbitrary viewpoints. This task is particularly challenging when
relying on monocular video, where disentangling structure from motion is
ill-posed and supervision is scarce. We introduce Video Diffusion-Aware
Reconstruction (ViDAR), a novel 4D reconstruction framework that leverages
personalised diffusion models to synthesise a pseudo multi-view supervision
signal for training a Gaussian splatting representation. By conditioning on
scene-specific features, ViDAR recovers fine-grained appearance details while
mitigating artefacts introduced by monocular ambiguity. To address the
spatio-temporal inconsistency of diffusion-based supervision, we propose a
diffusion-aware loss function and a camera pose optimisation strategy that
aligns synthetic views with the underlying scene geometry. Experiments on
DyCheck, a challenging benchmark with extreme viewpoint variation, show that
ViDAR outperforms all state-of-the-art baselines in visual quality and
geometric consistency. We further highlight ViDAR's strong improvement over
baselines on dynamic regions and provide a new benchmark to compare performance
in reconstructing motion-rich parts of the scene. Project page:

Conclusion: PicoSAM2证明了在相机上直接实现高效、可提示分割的可行性，支持隐私保护的视觉处理。

Abstract: Real-time, on-device segmentation is critical for latency-sensitive and
privacy-aware applications like smart glasses and IoT devices. We introduce
PicoSAM2, a lightweight (1.3M parameters, 336M MACs) promptable segmentation
model optimized for edge and in-sensor execution, including the Sony IMX500. It
builds on a depthwise separable U-Net, with knowledge distillation and
fixed-point prompt encoding to learn from the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2).
On COCO and LVIS, it achieves 51.9% and 44.9% mIoU, respectively. The quantized
model (1.22MB) runs at 14.3 ms on the IMX500-achieving 86 MACs/cycle, making it
the only model meeting both memory and compute constraints for in-sensor
deployment. Distillation boosts LVIS performance by +3.5% mIoU and +5.1% mAP.
These results demonstrate that efficient, promptable segmentation is feasible
directly on-camera, enabling privacy-preserving vision without cloud or host
processing.

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过创新设计和算法改进，显著提升了4D视频生成和重建的效果。

Abstract: We propose the first framework capable of computing a 4D spatio-temporal grid
of video frames and 3D Gaussian particles for each time step using a
feed-forward architecture. Our architecture has two main components, a 4D video
model and a 4D reconstruction model. In the first part, we analyze current 4D
video diffusion architectures that perform spatial and temporal attention
either sequentially or in parallel within a two-stream design. We highlight the
limitations of existing approaches and introduce a novel fused architecture
that performs spatial and temporal attention within a single layer. The key to
our method is a sparse attention pattern, where tokens attend to others in the
same frame, at the same timestamp, or from the same viewpoint. In the second
part, we extend existing 3D reconstruction algorithms by introducing a Gaussian
head, a camera token replacement algorithm, and additional dynamic layers and
training. Overall, we establish a new state of the art for 4D generation,
improving both visual quality and reconstruction capability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在遵循文本指令时存在复制粘贴问题，原因是训练时使用了同一场景的参考图像。

Method: 通过三阶段流程构建Phantom-Data数据集：主题检测、跨上下文主题检索和身份验证。

Result: 实验表明，使用Phantom-Data训练显著提升了提示对齐和视觉质量，同时保持了身份一致性。

Conclusion: Phantom-Data是首个通用跨对主题到视频一致性数据集，有效解决了现有模型的局限性。

Abstract: Subject-to-video generation has witnessed substantial progress in recent
years. However, existing models still face significant challenges in faithfully
following textual instructions. This limitation, commonly known as the
copy-paste problem, arises from the widely used in-pair training paradigm. This
approach inherently entangles subject identity with background and contextual
attributes by sampling reference images from the same scene as the target
video. To address this issue, we introduce \textbf{Phantom-Data, the first
general-purpose cross-pair subject-to-video consistency dataset}, containing
approximately one million identity-consistent pairs across diverse categories.
Our dataset is constructed via a three-stage pipeline: (1) a general and
input-aligned subject detection module, (2) large-scale cross-context subject
retrieval from more than 53 million videos and 3 billion images, and (3)
prior-guided identity verification to ensure visual consistency under
contextual variation. Comprehensive experiments show that training with
Phantom-Data significantly improves prompt alignment and visual quality while
preserving identity consistency on par with in-pair baselines.

Abstract: Accurate 6D pose estimation is key for robotic manipulation, enabling precise
object localization for tasks like grasping. We present RAG-6DPose, a
retrieval-augmented approach that leverages 3D CAD models as a knowledge base
by integrating both visual and geometric cues. Our RAG-6DPose roughly contains
three stages: 1) Building a Multi-Modal CAD Knowledge Base by extracting 2D
visual features from multi-view CAD rendered images and also attaching 3D
points; 2) Retrieving relevant CAD features from the knowledge base based on
the current query image via our ReSPC module; and 3) Incorporating retrieved
CAD information to refine pose predictions via retrieval-augmented decoding.
Experimental results on standard benchmarks and real-world robotic tasks
demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach, particularly in
handling occlusions and novel viewpoints. Supplementary material is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖手动或启发式编辑，缺乏灵活性，MVAA旨在实现高效自动对齐。

Method: MVAA分为关键帧对齐和节奏感知视频修复两步，采用预训练与快速微调策略。

Result: 实验显示MVAA能高质量对齐节奏并保持视觉流畅，适应时间短。

Conclusion: MVAA为视频音乐对齐提供高效灵活解决方案，适用于多媒体制作。

Abstract: Aligning the rhythm of visual motion in a video with a given music track is a
practical need in multimedia production, yet remains an underexplored task in
autonomous video editing. Effective alignment between motion and musical beats
enhances viewer engagement and visual appeal, particularly in music videos,
promotional content, and cinematic editing. Existing methods typically depend
on labor-intensive manual cutting, speed adjustments, or heuristic-based
editing techniques to achieve synchronization. While some generative models
handle joint video and music generation, they often entangle the two
modalities, limiting flexibility in aligning video to music beats while
preserving the full visual content. In this paper, we propose a novel and
efficient framework, termed MVAA (Music-Video Auto-Alignment), that
automatically edits video to align with the rhythm of a given music track while
preserving the original visual content. To enhance flexibility, we modularize
the task into a two-step process in our MVAA: aligning motion keyframes with
audio beats, followed by rhythm-aware video inpainting. Specifically, we first
insert keyframes at timestamps aligned with musical beats, then use a
frame-conditioned diffusion model to generate coherent intermediate frames,
preserving the original video's semantic content. Since comprehensive test-time
training can be time-consuming, we adopt a two-stage strategy: pretraining the
inpainting module on a small video set to learn general motion priors, followed
by rapid inference-time fine-tuning for video-specific adaptation. This hybrid
approach enables adaptation within 10 minutes with one epoch on a single NVIDIA
4090 GPU using CogVideoX-5b-I2V as the backbone. Extensive experiments show
that our approach can achieve high-quality beat alignment and visual
smoothness.

Abstract: Universal photometric stereo (PS) aims to recover high-quality surface
normals from objects under arbitrary lighting conditions without relying on

MS-PS, two fundamental challenges persist: 1) the deep coupling between varying
illumination and surface normal features, where ambiguity in observed intensity
makes it difficult to determine whether brightness variations stem from
lighting changes or surface orientation; and 2) the preservation of
high-frequency geometric details in complex surfaces, where intricate
geometries create self-shadowing, inter-reflections, and subtle normal
variations that conventional feature processing operations struggle to capture
accurately.

Abstract: This paper presents a computational model for universal video temporal
grounding, which accurately localizes temporal moments in videos based on
natural language queries (e.g., questions or descriptions). Unlike existing
methods that are often limited to specific video domains or durations, we
propose UniTime, a robust and universal video grounding model leveraging the
strong vision-language understanding capabilities of generative Multi-modal
Large Language Models (MLLMs). Our model effectively handles videos of diverse
views, genres, and lengths while comprehending complex language queries. The
key contributions include: (i) We consider steering strong MLLMs for temporal
grounding in videos. To enable precise timestamp outputs, we incorporate
temporal information by interleaving timestamp tokens with video tokens. (ii)
By training the model to handle videos with different input granularities
through adaptive frame scaling, our approach achieves robust temporal grounding
for both short and long videos. (iii) Comprehensive experiments show that
UniTime outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both zero-shot and
dataset-specific finetuned settings across five public temporal grounding
benchmarks. (iv) When employed as a preliminary moment retriever for long-form
video question-answering (VideoQA), UniTime significantly improves VideoQA
accuracy, highlighting its value for complex video understanding tasks.

Abstract: Can we scale 4D pretraining to learn general space-time representations that
reconstruct an object from a few views at some times to any view at any time?
We provide an affirmative answer with 4D-LRM, the first large-scale 4D
reconstruction model that takes input from unconstrained views and timestamps
and renders arbitrary novel view-time combinations. Unlike prior 4D approaches,
e.g., optimization-based, geometry-based, or generative, that struggle with
efficiency, generalization, or faithfulness, 4D-LRM learns a unified space-time
representation and directly predicts per-pixel 4D Gaussian primitives from
posed image tokens across time, enabling fast, high-quality rendering at, in
principle, infinite frame rate. Our results demonstrate that scaling
spatiotemporal pretraining enables accurate and efficient 4D reconstruction. We
show that 4D-LRM generalizes to novel objects, interpolates across time, and
handles diverse camera setups. It reconstructs 24-frame sequences in one
forward pass with less than 1.5 seconds on a single A100 GPU.

Conclusion: FilMaster通过结合真实电影原则和生成AI技术，显著提升了AI生成电影的专业性和吸引力。

Abstract: AI-driven content creation has shown potential in film production. However,
existing film generation systems struggle to implement cinematic principles and
thus fail to generate professional-quality films, particularly lacking diverse
camera language and cinematic rhythm. This results in templated visuals and
unengaging narratives. To address this, we introduce FilMaster, an end-to-end
AI system that integrates real-world cinematic principles for
professional-grade film generation, yielding editable, industry-standard
outputs. FilMaster is built on two key principles: (1) learning cinematography
from extensive real-world film data and (2) emulating professional,
audience-centric post-production workflows. Inspired by these principles,
FilMaster incorporates two stages: a Reference-Guided Generation Stage which
transforms user input to video clips, and a Generative Post-Production Stage
which transforms raw footage into audiovisual outputs by orchestrating visual
and auditory elements for cinematic rhythm. Our generation stage highlights a
Multi-shot Synergized RAG Camera Language Design module to guide the AI in
generating professional camera language by retrieving reference clips from a
vast corpus of 440,000 film clips. Our post-production stage emulates
professional workflows by designing an Audience-Centric Cinematic Rhythm
Control module, including Rough Cut and Fine Cut processes informed by
simulated audience feedback, for effective integration of audiovisual elements
to achieve engaging content. The system is empowered by generative AI models
like (M)LLMs and video generation models. Furthermore, we introduce FilmEval, a
comprehensive benchmark for evaluating AI-generated films. Extensive
experiments show FilMaster's superior performance in camera language design and
cinematic rhythm control, advancing generative AI in professional filmmaking.

Result: 定量和定性实验表明，该方法在多面板一致性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架灵活且模型无关，能有效提升故事可视化的视觉一致性。

Abstract: Story visualization has become a popular task where visual scenes are
generated to depict a narrative across multiple panels. A central challenge in
this setting is maintaining visual consistency, particularly in how characters
and objects persist and evolve throughout the story. Despite recent advances in
diffusion models, current approaches often fail to preserve key character
attributes, leading to incoherent narratives. In this work, we propose a
collaborative multi-agent framework that autonomously identifies, corrects, and
refines inconsistencies across multi-panel story visualizations. The agents
operate in an iterative loop, enabling fine-grained, panel-level updates
without re-generating entire sequences. Our framework is model-agnostic and
flexibly integrates with a variety of diffusion models, including rectified
flow transformers such as Flux and latent diffusion models such as Stable
Diffusion. Quantitative and qualitative experiments show that our method
outperforms prior approaches in terms of multi-panel consistency.

Result: 实现了控制信号从虚拟到真实场景的映射，并能泛化控制多种真实世界实体（如自行车、行人）。

Conclusion: RealPlay展示了在无需真实世界动作标注的情况下，生成逼真交互视频的潜力。

Abstract: We introduce RealPlay, a neural network-based real-world game engine that
enables interactive video generation from user control signals. Unlike prior
works focused on game-style visuals, RealPlay aims to produce photorealistic,
temporally consistent video sequences that resemble real-world footage. It
operates in an interactive loop: users observe a generated scene, issue a
control command, and receive a short video chunk in response. To enable such
realistic and responsive generation, we address key challenges including
iterative chunk-wise prediction for low-latency feedback, temporal consistency
across iterations, and accurate control response. RealPlay is trained on a
combination of labeled game data and unlabeled real-world videos, without
requiring real-world action annotations. Notably, we observe two forms of
generalization: (1) control transfer-RealPlay effectively maps control signals
from virtual to real-world scenarios; and (2) entity transfer-although training
labels originate solely from a car racing game, RealPlay generalizes to control
diverse real-world entities, including bicycles and pedestrians, beyond
vehicles. Project page can be found: https://wenqsun.github.io/RealPlay/

Result: 在长期场景合成基准测试中表现优异，显著提升了场景一致性和相机控制能力。

Conclusion: VMem机制在保持场景一致性和降低计算成本方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: We propose a novel memory mechanism to build video generators that can
explore environments interactively. Similar results have previously been
achieved by out-painting 2D views of the scene while incrementally
reconstructing its 3D geometry, which quickly accumulates errors, or by video
generators with a short context window, which struggle to maintain scene
coherence over the long term. To address these limitations, we introduce
Surfel-Indexed View Memory (VMem), a mechanism that remembers past views by
indexing them geometrically based on the 3D surface elements (surfels) they
have observed. VMem enables the efficient retrieval of the most relevant past
views when generating new ones. By focusing only on these relevant views, our
method produces consistent explorations of imagined environments at a fraction
of the computational cost of using all past views as context. We evaluate our
approach on challenging long-term scene synthesis benchmarks and demonstrate
superior performance compared to existing methods in maintaining scene
coherence and camera control.

TL;DR: TC-Light是一种新的视频重光照方法，通过两阶段优化机制实现高效、时间一致的光照编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频重光照技术局限于肖像视频或存在时间一致性和计算效率问题，TC-Light旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 采用两阶段后优化机制：第一阶段优化外观嵌入以对齐全局光照，第二阶段优化提出的唯一视频张量（UVT）以对齐细粒度纹理和光照。

Result: 实验表明，TC-Light能实现物理上合理、时间一致且计算成本低的重光照效果。

Conclusion: TC-Light为复杂动态视频的光照编辑提供了高效且一致的解决方案。

Abstract: Editing illumination in long videos with complex dynamics has significant
value in various downstream tasks, including visual content creation and
manipulation, as well as data scaling up for embodied AI through sim2real and
real2real transfer. Nevertheless, existing video relighting techniques are
predominantly limited to portrait videos or fall into the bottleneck of
temporal consistency and computation efficiency. In this paper, we propose
TC-Light, a novel paradigm characterized by the proposed two-stage post
optimization mechanism. Starting from the video preliminarily relighted by an
inflated video relighting model, it optimizes appearance embedding in the first
stage to align global illumination. Then it optimizes the proposed canonical
video representation, i.e., Unique Video Tensor (UVT), to align fine-grained
texture and lighting in the second stage. To comprehensively evaluate
performance, we also establish a long and highly dynamic video benchmark.
Extensive experiments show that our method enables physically plausible
relighting results with superior temporal coherence and low computation cost.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: FramePrompt是一个简洁而强大的框架，通过将参考图像、骨架引导的运动和目标视频片段视为统一的视觉序列，解决了从参考图像和运动引导生成可控角色动画的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖复杂架构或多阶段处理流程，增加了结构开销并阻碍部署。本文旨在简化流程并利用预训练模型的视觉上下文建模能力。

Method: 将动画任务重新定义为条件未来预测任务，无需引导网络或结构修改，直接利用预训练的视频扩散变换器。

Result: 实验表明，FramePrompt在多种评估指标上显著优于基线方法，同时简化了训练过程。

Conclusion: 序列级视觉条件化有效，预训练模型无需架构修改即可实现可控动画。

Abstract: Generating controllable character animation from a reference image and motion
guidance remains a challenging task due to the inherent difficulty of injecting
appearance and motion cues into video diffusion models. Prior works often rely
on complex architectures, explicit guider modules, or multi-stage processing
pipelines, which increase structural overhead and hinder deployment. Inspired
by the strong visual context modeling capacity of pre-trained video diffusion
transformers, we propose FramePrompt, a minimalist yet powerful framework that
treats reference images, skeleton-guided motion, and target video clips as a
unified visual sequence. By reformulating animation as a conditional future
prediction task, we bypass the need for guider networks and structural
modifications. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms representative baselines across various evaluation metrics while
also simplifying training. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of
sequence-level visual conditioning and demonstrate the potential of pre-trained
models for controllable animation without architectural changes.

Abstract: We present BlenderFusion, a generative visual compositing framework that
synthesizes new scenes by recomposing objects, camera, and background. It
follows a layering-editing-compositing pipeline: (i) segmenting and converting
visual inputs into editable 3D entities (layering), (ii) editing them in
Blender with 3D-grounded control (editing), and (iii) fusing them into a
coherent scene using a generative compositor (compositing). Our generative
compositor extends a pre-trained diffusion model to process both the original
(source) and edited (target) scenes in parallel. It is fine-tuned on video
frames with two key training strategies: (i) source masking, enabling flexible
modifications like background replacement; (ii) simulated object jittering,
facilitating disentangled control over objects and camera. BlenderFusion
significantly outperforms prior methods in complex compositional scene editing
tasks.

Result: 在公开数据集GauU-Scene V2上实验，优于现有NeRF和高斯泼溅方法，实现了高保真视觉结果和精确表面重建。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了大规模场景重建的挑战，代码将开源。

Abstract: Recent developments in 3D Gaussian Splatting have made significant advances
in surface reconstruction. However, scaling these methods to large-scale scenes
remains challenging due to high computational demands and the complex dynamic
appearances typical of outdoor environments. These challenges hinder the
application in aerial surveying and autonomous driving. This paper proposes a
novel solution to reconstruct large-scale surfaces with fine details,
supervised by full-sized images. Firstly, we introduce a coarse-to-fine
strategy to reconstruct a coarse model efficiently, followed by adaptive scene
partitioning and sub-scene refining from image segments. Additionally, we
integrate a decoupling appearance model to capture global appearance variations
and a transient mask model to mitigate interference from moving objects.
Finally, we expand the multi-view constraint and introduce a single-view
regularization for texture-less areas. Our experiments were conducted on the
publicly available dataset GauU-Scene V2, which was captured using unmanned
aerial vehicles. To the best of our knowledge, our method outperforms existing
NeRF-based and Gaussian-based methods, achieving high-fidelity visual results
and accurate surface from full-size image optimization. Open-source code will
be available on GitHub.

Motivation: 现有随机纹理过滤（STF）技术在放大时可能产生不良视觉变化和噪声，需改进。

Method: 利用GPU波通信在着色器内共享解码纹理值，避免重复解压，并提出新的过滤回退方法。

Result: 实现了零误差过滤（放大因子足够大时），其他情况下过滤质量优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 新算法通过波通信和共享纹理值，显著提升了STF的视觉质量和效率。

Abstract: Recent advances in texture compression provide major improvements in
compression ratios, but cannot use the GPU's texture units for decompression
and filtering. This has led to the development of stochastic texture filtering
(STF) techniques to avoid the high cost of multiple texel evaluations with such
formats. Unfortunately, those methods can give undesirable visual appearance
changes under magnification and may contain visible noise and flicker despite
the use of spatiotemporal denoisers. Recent work substantially improves the
quality of magnification filtering with STF by sharing decoded texel values
between nearby pixels (Wronski 2025). Using GPU wave communication intrinsics,
this sharing can be performed inside actively executing shaders without memory
traffic overhead. We take this idea further and present novel algorithms that
use wave communication between lanes to avoid repeated texel decompression
prior to filtering. By distributing unique work across lanes, we can achieve
zero-error filtering using <=1 texel evaluations per pixel given a sufficiently
large magnification factor. For the remaining cases, we propose novel filtering
fallback methods that also achieve higher quality than prior approaches.

Result: 在包含流形和非流形网格的UV展开基准测试中表现优异，并为3D分割工具提供清晰边界。

Conclusion: SeamGPT通过模仿专业工作流程，显著提升了表面切割任务的语义连贯性和技术性能。

Abstract: Surface cutting is a fundamental task in computer graphics, with applications
in UV parameterization, texture mapping, and mesh decomposition. However,
existing methods often produce technically valid but overly fragmented atlases
that lack semantic coherence. We introduce SeamGPT, an auto-regressive model
that generates cutting seams by mimicking professional workflows. Our key
technical innovation lies in formulating surface cutting as a next token
prediction task: sample point clouds on mesh vertices and edges, encode them as
shape conditions, and employ a GPT-style transformer to sequentially predict
seam segments with quantized 3D coordinates. Our approach achieves exceptional
performance on UV unwrapping benchmarks containing both manifold and
non-manifold meshes, including artist-created, and 3D-scanned models. In
addition, it enhances existing 3D segmentation tools by providing clean
boundaries for part decomposition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 加速扩散模型的生成过程，同时保持无损性能。

Result: 在6个图像生成任务中，平均速度提升1.78X至3.31X，且适用于Latent Consistency Model。

Conclusion: Morse在保持性能的同时显著提升了扩散模型的效率，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: In this paper, we present Morse, a simple dual-sampling framework for
accelerating diffusion models losslessly. The key insight of Morse is to
reformulate the iterative generation (from noise to data) process via taking
advantage of fast jump sampling and adaptive residual feedback strategies.
Specifically, Morse involves two models called Dash and Dot that interact with
each other. The Dash model is just the pre-trained diffusion model of any type,
but operates in a jump sampling regime, creating sufficient space for sampling
efficiency improvement. The Dot model is significantly faster than the Dash
model, which is learnt to generate residual feedback conditioned on the
observations at the current jump sampling point on the trajectory of the Dash
model, lifting the noise estimate to easily match the next-step estimate of the
Dash model without jump sampling. By chaining the outputs of the Dash and Dot
models run in a time-interleaved fashion, Morse exhibits the merit of flexibly
attaining desired image generation performance while improving overall runtime
efficiency. With our proposed weight sharing strategy between the Dash and Dot
models, Morse is efficient for training and inference. Our method shows a
lossless speedup of 1.78X to 3.31X on average over a wide range of sampling
step budgets relative to 9 baseline diffusion models on 6 image generation
tasks. Furthermore, we show that our method can be also generalized to improve
the Latent Consistency Model (LCM-SDXL, which is already accelerated with
consistency distillation technique) tailored for few-step text-to-image
synthesis. The code and models are available at

Motivation: 传递函数（TF）设计在直接体积渲染（DVR）中至关重要，但现有方法存在探索空间大和泛化能力弱的挑战。

Method: 提出WYTWYG框架，包含基于进化的探索器和基于MLLMs的体积渲染质量评估器，并开发了交互式TF设计系统。

Result: 通过三个案例研究验证了框架的通用性，并通过实验证明了各组成部分的有效性。

Conclusion: WYTWYG框架显著提升了TF优化的效率和泛化能力。

Abstract: Direct volume rendering (DVR) is a fundamental technique for visualizing
volumetric data, with transfer functions (TFs) playing a crucial role in
extracting meaningful structures. However, designing effective TFs remains
unintuitive due to the semantic gap between user intent and TF parameter space.
Researchers have developed numerous TF optimization methods to bridge this gap.
However, existing methods still face two challenges: large exploration space
and weak generalizability. To address these issues, we propose What You Think
is What You Get (WYTWYG) framework, which leveraging Multi-model Large Language
Models (MLLMs) to guide the TF optimization based on user intent. Specifically,
we first introduce a novel TF optimization approach comprising two core
components: (1) an evolution-based explorer for effective exploration of the TF
space, and (2) a volume rendering quality evaluator based on MLLMs to provide
generalizable visual guidance. We further propose a TF interactive design
system based on this approach. We demonstrate the general applicability of our
framework through three case studies, and validate the effectiveness of each
component through extensive experiments. Our code is available at:

Abstract: Transforming casually captured, monocular videos into fully immersive dynamic
experiences is a highly ill-posed task, and comes with significant challenges,
e.g., reconstructing unseen regions, and dealing with the ambiguity in
monocular depth estimation. In this work we introduce BulletGen, an approach
that takes advantage of generative models to correct errors and complete
missing information in a Gaussian-based dynamic scene representation. This is
done by aligning the output of a diffusion-based video generation model with
the 4D reconstruction at a single frozen "bullet-time" step. The generated
frames are then used to supervise the optimization of the 4D Gaussian model.
Our method seamlessly blends generative content with both static and dynamic
scene components, achieving state-of-the-art results on both novel-view
synthesis, and 2D/3D tracking tasks.

Conclusion: DuetGen通过分层建模和交互表示，实现了高质量的双人舞蹈生成。

Abstract: We present DuetGen, a novel framework for generating interactive two-person
dances from music. The key challenge of this task lies in the inherent
complexities of two-person dance interactions, where the partners need to
synchronize both with each other and with the music. Inspired by the recent
advances in motion synthesis, we propose a two-stage solution: encoding
two-person motions into discrete tokens and then generating these tokens from
music. To effectively capture intricate interactions, we represent both
dancers' motions as a unified whole to learn the necessary motion tokens, and
adopt a coarse-to-fine learning strategy in both the stages. Our first stage
utilizes a VQ-VAE that hierarchically separates high-level semantic features at
a coarse temporal resolution from low-level details at a finer resolution,
producing two discrete token sequences at different abstraction levels.
Subsequently, in the second stage, two generative masked transformers learn to
map music signals to these dance tokens: the first producing high-level
semantic tokens, and the second, conditioned on music and these semantic
tokens, producing the low-level tokens. We train both transformers to learn to
predict randomly masked tokens within the sequence, enabling them to
iteratively generate motion tokens by filling an empty token sequence during
inference. Through the hierarchical masked modeling and dedicated interaction
representation, DuetGen achieves the generation of synchronized and interactive
two-person dances across various genres. Extensive experiments and user studies
on a benchmark duet dance dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of
DuetGen in motion realism, music-dance alignment, and partner coordination.

develop a reduced integration scheme that separately optimizes quadrature rules
for membrane and bending energies, further reducing computational overhead
while maintaining accuracy. We validate our approach through extensive

compared to linear FEM and recent higher-order methods. Our method enables

Abstract: Outcome-Based Education (OBE) emphasizes the development of specific

importance of OBE and implemented transformer-based models, particularly
DistilBERT, to analyze an NLP dataset that includes student feedback. Our
objective is to assess and improve educational outcomes. Our approach is better
than other machine learning models because it uses the transformer's deep
understanding of language context to classify sentiment better, giving better
results across a wider range of matrices. Our work directly contributes to
OBE's goal of achieving measurable outcomes by facilitating the identification
of patterns in student learning experiences. We have also applied LIME (local
interpretable model-agnostic explanations) to make sure that model predictions
are clear. This gives us understandable information about how key terms affect
sentiment. Our findings indicate that the combination of transformer models and
LIME explanations results in a strong and straightforward framework for
analyzing student feedback. This aligns more closely with the principles of OBE
and ensures the improvement of educational practices through data-driven

Abstract: Attacks on large language models (LLMs) in jailbreaking scenarios raise many
security and ethical issues. Current jailbreak attack methods face problems
such as low efficiency, high computational cost, and poor cross-model
adaptability and versatility, which make it difficult to cope with the rapid
development of LLM and new defense strategies. Our work proposes an Adversarial
Prompt Distillation, which combines masked language modeling, reinforcement
learning, and dynamic temperature control through a prompt generation and
distillation method. It enables small language models (SLMs) to jailbreak
attacks on mainstream LLMs. The experimental results verify the superiority of
the proposed method in terms of attack success rate and harm, and reflect the
resource efficiency and cross-model adaptability. This research explores the
feasibility of distilling the jailbreak ability of LLM to SLM, reveals the
model's vulnerability, and provides a new idea for LLM security research.

Result: GTA减少计算FLOPs达62.5%，KV缓存减少70%，推理速度提升2倍。

Conclusion: GTA有效优化了LLM的部署效率，同时保持了性能。

Abstract: Attention mechanisms underpin the success of large language models (LLMs),
yet their substantial computational and memory overhead poses challenges for
optimizing efficiency and performance. A critical bottleneck arises as KV cache
and attention computations scale rapidly with text length, challenging
deployment on hardware with limited computational and memory resources. We
observe that attention mechanisms exhibit substantial redundancy, since the KV
cache can be significantly compressed and attention maps across heads display
high similarity, revealing that much of the computation and storage is
unnecessary. Leveraging these insights, we propose \textbf{G}rouped-Head
Laten\textbf{T} \textbf{A}ttention (GTA), a novel attention mechanism that
reduces memory usage and computational complexity while maintaining
performance. GTA comprises two components: (1) a shared attention map mechanism
that reuses attention scores across multiple heads, decreasing the key cache
size; and (2) a nonlinear value decoder with learned projections that
compresses the value cache into a latent space, further cutting memory needs.
GTA cuts attention computation FLOPs by up to \emph{62.5\%} versus
Grouped-Query Attention and shrink the KV cache by up to \emph{70\%}, all while
avoiding the extra overhead of Multi-Head Latent Attention to improve LLM
deployment efficiency. Consequently, GTA models achieve a \emph{2x} increase in
end-to-end inference speed, with prefill benefiting from reduced computational
cost and decoding benefiting from the smaller cache footprint.

Result: CoT解码提高语义多样性且降低预测熵，代码生成Pass@2率提升48.8%；推测性采样在摘要任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 结构化解码方法可平衡多样性与准确性，对实际应用中的LLM部署具有重要意义。

Abstract: This study investigates semantic uncertainty in large language model (LLM)
outputs across different decoding methods, focusing on emerging techniques like
speculative sampling and chain-of-thought (CoT) decoding. Through experiments
on question answering, summarization, and code generation tasks, we analyze how
different decoding strategies affect both the diversity and reliability of
model outputs. Our findings reveal that while CoT decoding demonstrates higher
semantic diversity, it maintains lower predictive entropy, suggesting that
structured exploration can lead to more confident and accurate outputs. This is
evidenced by a 48.8% improvement in code generation Pass@2 rates, despite lower
alignment with reference solutions. For summarization tasks, speculative
sampling proved particularly effective, achieving superior ROUGE scores while
maintaining moderate semantic diversity. Our results challenge conventional
assumptions about trade-offs between diversity and accuracy in language model
outputs, demonstrating that properly structured decoding methods can increase
semantic exploration while maintaining or improving output quality. These
findings have significant implications for deploying language models in
practical applications where both reliability and diverse solution generation
are crucial.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs能力的提升，其安全评估的重要性日益凸显，尤其是模型可能表现出欺骗行为，需研究这些行为是否源于其内部的隐蔽意图。

Method: 通过回顾心智理论相关研究，分析其在安全评估中的应用，并评估一系列开源LLMs的心智理论能力发展情况。

Result: 研究发现，尽管LLMs的阅读理解能力有所提升，但其心智理论能力并未同步发展。

Conclusion: 论文总结了LLMs心智理论能力的现状及其对安全评估的挑战，并提出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: As the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, the
importance of rigorous safety evaluation is becoming increasingly evident.
Recent concerns within the realm of safety assessment have highlighted
instances in which LLMs exhibit behaviors that appear to disable oversight
mechanisms and respond in a deceptive manner. For example, there have been
reports suggesting that, when confronted with information unfavorable to their
own persistence during task execution, LLMs may act covertly and even provide
false answers to questions intended to verify their behavior.To evaluate the
potential risk of such deceptive actions toward developers or users, it is
essential to investigate whether these behaviors stem from covert, intentional
processes within the model. In this study, we propose that it is necessary to
measure the theory of mind capabilities of LLMs. We begin by reviewing existing
research on theory of mind and identifying the perspectives and tasks relevant
to its application in safety evaluation. Given that theory of mind has been
predominantly studied within the context of developmental psychology, we
analyze developmental trends across a series of open-weight LLMs. Our results
indicate that while LLMs have improved in reading comprehension, their theory
of mind capabilities have not shown comparable development. Finally, we present
the current state of safety evaluation with respect to LLMs' theory of mind,
and discuss remaining challenges for future work.

Motivation: 探索LLMs在涉及金钱与用户舒适度冲突的决策场景中的行为表现，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 通过量化多个LLMs对用户不适（如额外步行、等待、饥饿和疼痛）的定价，分析其决策行为。

Result: 发现LLMs存在响应差异大、对提示微小变化敏感、接受不合理低报酬或拒绝无不适高报酬等问题。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在金钱与舒适度权衡中的表现不可靠，需进一步审查其决策机制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly proposed as near-autonomous
artificial intelligence (AI) agents capable of making everyday decisions on
behalf of humans. Although LLMs perform well on many technical tasks, their
behaviour in personal decision-making remains less understood. Previous studies
have assessed their rationality and moral alignment with human decisions.
However, the behaviour of AI assistants in scenarios where financial rewards
are at odds with user comfort has not yet been thoroughly explored. In this
paper, we tackle this problem by quantifying the prices assigned by multiple
LLMs to a series of user discomforts: additional walking, waiting, hunger and
pain. We uncover several key concerns that strongly question the prospect of
using current LLMs as decision-making assistants: (1) a large variance in
responses between LLMs, (2) within a single LLM, responses show fragility to
minor variations in prompt phrasing (e.g., reformulating the question in the
first person can considerably alter the decision), (3) LLMs can accept
unreasonably low rewards for major inconveniences (e.g., 1 Euro to wait 10
hours), and (4) LLMs can reject monetary gains where no discomfort is imposed
(e.g., 1,000 Euro to wait 0 minutes). These findings emphasize the need for
scrutiny of how LLMs value human inconvenience, particularly as we move toward
applications where such cash-versus-comfort trade-offs are made on users'
behalf.

Abstract: Tutoring improves student achievement, but identifying and studying what
tutoring actions are most associated with student learning at scale based on
audio transcriptions is an open research problem. This present study
investigates the feasibility and scalability of using generative AI to identify
and evaluate specific tutor moves in real-life math tutoring. We analyze 50
randomly selected transcripts of college-student remote tutors assisting middle
school students in mathematics. Using GPT-4, GPT-4o, GPT-4-turbo,
Gemini-1.5-pro, and LearnLM, we assess tutors' application of two tutor skills:
delivering effective praise and responding to student math errors. All models
reliably detected relevant situations, for example, tutors providing praise to
students (94-98% accuracy) and a student making a math error (82-88% accuracy)
and effectively evaluated the tutors' adherence to tutoring best practices,
aligning closely with human judgments (83-89% and 73-77%, respectively). We
propose a cost-effective prompting strategy and discuss practical implications
for using large language models to support scalable assessment in authentic
settings. This work further contributes LLM prompts to support reproducibility

Conclusion: UProp为LLM在多步决策中的不确定性量化提供了有效解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are integrated into safety-critical
applications involving sequential decision-making in the real world, it is
essential to know when to trust LLM decisions. Existing LLM Uncertainty
Quantification (UQ) methods are primarily designed for single-turn
question-answering formats, resulting in multi-step decision-making scenarios,
e.g., LLM agentic system, being underexplored. In this paper, we introduce a
principled, information-theoretic framework that decomposes LLM sequential
decision uncertainty into two parts: (i) internal uncertainty intrinsic to the
current decision, which is focused on existing UQ methods, and (ii) extrinsic
uncertainty, a Mutual-Information (MI) quantity describing how much uncertainty
should be inherited from preceding decisions. We then propose UProp, an
efficient and effective extrinsic uncertainty estimator that converts the
direct estimation of MI to the estimation of Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI)
over multiple Trajectory-Dependent Decision Processes (TDPs). UProp is
evaluated over extensive multi-step decision-making benchmarks, e.g.,
AgentBench and HotpotQA, with state-of-the-art LLMs, e.g., GPT-4.1 and
DeepSeek-V3. Experimental results demonstrate that UProp significantly
outperforms existing single-turn UQ baselines equipped with thoughtful
aggregation strategies. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive analysis of UProp,
including sampling efficiency, potential applications, and intermediate
uncertainty propagation, to demonstrate its effectiveness. Codes will be
available at https://github.com/jinhaoduan/UProp.

Motivation: 探索LLMs在仅通过URL分类政治内容的能力，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 使用GPT、Llama等LLMs，对比URL和全文分析，并与人工标注和传统机器学习方法比较。

Result: URL能有效近似全文分析，提供准确性-成本平衡的视角。

Conclusion: URL在政治内容分类中具有潜力，但需考虑上下文限制和方法优化。

Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) is becoming common in the context of
political science, particularly in studies that analyse individuals use of
digital media. However, while previous research has demonstrated LLMs ability
at labelling tasks, the effectiveness of using LLMs to classify political
content (PC) from just URLs is not yet well explored. The work presented in
this article bridges this gap by evaluating whether LLMs can accurately
identify PC vs. non-PC from both the article text and the URLs from five
countries (France, Germany, Spain, the UK, and the US) and different languages.
Using cutting-edge LLMs like GPT, Llama, Mistral, Deepseek, Qwen and Gemma, we
measure model performance to assess whether URL-level analysis can be a good
approximation for full-text analysis of PC, even across different linguistic
and national contexts. Model outputs are compared with human-labelled articles,
as well as traditional supervised machine learning techniques, to set a
baseline of performance. Overall, our findings suggest the capacity of URLs to
embed most of the news content, providing a vital perspective on accuracy-cost
balancing. We also account for contextual limitations and suggest
methodological recommendations to use LLMs within political science studies.

including spontaneous speech, environmental noise, and severely constrained
datasets from under-documented languages. In this paper, we benchmark the
performance of two fine-tuned multilingual ASR models, MMS and XLS-R, on five
typologically diverse low-resource languages with control of training data
duration. Our findings show that MMS is best suited when extremely small
amounts of training data are available, whereas XLS-R shows parity performance
once training data exceed one hour. We provide linguistically grounded analysis
for further provide insights towards practical guidelines for field linguists,
highlighting reproducible ASR adaptation approaches to mitigate the

This dissertation examines how individuals and institutions are adapting to and
engaging with this emerging technology through three research directions.
First, I demonstrate how the institutional adoption of AI detectors introduces
systematic biases, particularly disadvantaging writers of non-dominant language
varieties, highlighting critical equity concerns in AI governance. Second, I
present novel population-level algorithmic approaches that measure the
increasing adoption of LLMs across writing domains, revealing consistent
patterns of AI-assisted content in academic peer reviews, scientific
publications, consumer complaints, corporate communications, job postings, and
international organization press releases. Finally, I investigate LLMs'
capability to provide feedback on research manuscripts through a large-scale
empirical analysis, offering insights into their potential to support
researchers who face barriers in accessing timely manuscript feedback,

Motivation: 现代GPU发展迅速，但生产编译器仍依赖手工调优的寄存器分配启发式方法，需为每代硬件重新调优。

Method: VeriLocc通过微调LLM将中间表示（MIR）转换为目标特定的寄存器分配，结合静态分析和验证器引导的再生循环确保正确性。

Result: 在GEMM和MHA任务中，VeriLocc单次准确率达85-99%，pass@100接近100%，性能优于rocBLAS 10%以上。

Conclusion: VeriLocc为跨架构寄存器分配提供了一种高效且可验证的解决方案。

Abstract: Modern GPUs evolve rapidly, yet production compilers still rely on
hand-crafted register allocation heuristics that require substantial re-tuning
for each hardware generation. We introduce VeriLocc, a framework that combines
large language models (LLMs) with formal compiler techniques to enable
generalizable and verifiable register allocation across GPU architectures.
VeriLocc fine-tunes an LLM to translate intermediate representations (MIRs)
into target-specific register assignments, aided by static analysis for
cross-architecture normalization and generalization and a verifier-guided
regeneration loop to ensure correctness. Evaluated on matrix multiplication
(GEMM) and multi-head attention (MHA), VeriLocc achieves 85-99% single-shot
accuracy and near-100% pass@100. Case study shows that VeriLocc discovers more
performant assignments than expert-tuned libraries, outperforming rocBLAS by

Result: 宏观问题在资源匮乏的语言中更普遍，需加强语言规划和数据质量控制。

Conclusion: 提出未来数据集开发的指导建议，强调社会语言学意识的重要性。

Abstract: Our quality audit for three widely used public multilingual speech datasets -
Mozilla Common Voice 17.0, FLEURS, and VoxPopuli - shows that in some
languages, these datasets suffer from significant quality issues. We believe
addressing these issues will make these datasets more useful as training and
evaluation sets, and improve downstream models. We divide these quality issues
into two categories: micro-level and macro-level. We find that macro-level
issues are more prevalent in less institutionalized, often under-resourced
languages. We provide a case analysis of Taiwanese Southern Min (nan_tw) that
highlights the need for proactive language planning (e.g. orthography
prescriptions, dialect boundary definition) and enhanced data quality control
in the process of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) dataset creation. We
conclude by proposing guidelines and recommendations to mitigate these issues
in future dataset development, emphasizing the importance of sociolinguistic

Conclusion: DuaShepherd通过整合正确性和潜力奖励信号，有效提升了大语言模型的数学推理能力。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose DuaShepherd, a novel reward modeling framework that
integrates two complementary reward signals, correctness and potential, to
enhance the mathematical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs). While correctness-based signals emphasize identification of stepwise
errors, potential-based signals focus on the likelihood of reaching the correct
final answer. We developed an automated pipeline for constructing large-scale
reward modeling dataset with both signals. A unified, multi-head architecture
was explored to train the two reward models in a multi-task setup,
demonstrating benefits from learning both correctness and potential in
parallel. By combining these two signals into a compound probability, our model
achieves consistent performance improvements across multiple benchmarks.
Empirical evaluations on MATH500 and ProcessBench confirm that this combined
reward significantly outperforms models trained on either reward type alone,
achieving state-of-the-art performance under comparable resource constraints.

Result: 口音强度由特定语音特征的权重预测，且与美式和印度英语基线的距离显著相关。

Conclusion: 自监督语音表征可用于基于可解释语音特征的口音感知建模。

Abstract: Traditional models of accent perception underestimate the role of gradient
variations in phonological features which listeners rely upon for their accent
judgments. We investigate how pretrained representations from current
self-supervised learning (SSL) models of speech encode phonological
feature-level variations that influence the perception of segmental accent. We
focus on three segments: the labiodental approximant, the rhotic tap, and the
retroflex stop, which are uniformly produced in the English of native speakers
of Hindi as well as other languages in the Indian sub-continent. We use the
CSLU Foreign Accented English corpus (Lander, 2007) to extract, for these
segments, phonological feature probabilities using Phonet (V\'asquez-Correa et
al., 2019) and pretrained representations from Wav2Vec2-BERT (Barrault et al.,
2023) and WavLM (Chen et al., 2022) along with accent judgements by native
speakers of American English. Probing analyses show that accent strength is
best predicted by a subset of the segment's pretrained representation features,
in which perceptually salient phonological features that contrast the expected
American English and realized non-native English segments are given prominent
weighting. A multinomial logistic regression of pretrained representation-based
segment distances from American and Indian English baselines on accent ratings
reveals strong associations between the odds of accent strength and distances
from the baselines, in the expected directions. These results highlight the
value of self-supervised speech representations for modeling accent perception
using interpretable phonological features.

Result: AgriCHN数据质量高，实体类型丰富且划分细致，基准测试显示其具有挑战性和研究潜力。

Conclusion: AgriCHN为农业命名实体识别提供了高质量资源，推动了相关研究的进一步发展。

Abstract: Agricultural named entity recognition is a specialized task focusing on
identifying distinct agricultural entities within vast bodies of text,
including crops, diseases, pests, and fertilizers. It plays a crucial role in
enhancing information extraction from extensive agricultural text resources.
However, the scarcity of high-quality agricultural datasets, particularly in
Chinese, has resulted in suboptimal performance when employing mainstream
methods for this purpose. Most earlier works only focus on annotating
agricultural entities while overlook the profound correlation of agriculture
with hydrology and meteorology. To fill this blank, we present AgriCHN, a
comprehensive open-source Chinese resource designed to promote the accuracy of
automated agricultural entity annotation. The AgriCHN dataset has been
meticulously curated from a wealth of agricultural articles, comprising a total
of 4,040 sentences and encapsulating 15,799 agricultural entity mentions
spanning 27 diverse entity categories. Furthermore, it encompasses entities
from hydrology to meteorology, thereby enriching the diversity of entities
considered. Data validation reveals that, compared with relevant resources,
AgriCHN demonstrates outstanding data quality, attributable to its richer
agricultural entity types and more fine-grained entity divisions. A benchmark
task has also been constructed using several state-of-the-art neural NER
models. Extensive experimental results highlight the significant challenge
posed by AgriCHN and its potential for further research.

Abstract: Morphological defectivity is an intriguing and understudied phenomenon in
linguistics. Addressing defectivity, where expected inflectional forms are
absent, is essential for improving the accuracy of NLP tools in morphologically
rich languages. However, traditional linguistic resources often lack coverage
of morphological gaps as such knowledge requires significant human expertise
and effort to document and verify. For scarce linguistic phenomena in
under-explored languages, Wikipedia and Wiktionary often serve as among the few
accessible resources. Despite their extensive reach, their reliability has been
a subject of controversy. This study customizes a novel neural morphological
analyzer to annotate Latin and Italian corpora. Using the massive annotated
data, crowd-sourced lists of defective verbs compiled from Wiktionary are
validated computationally. Our results indicate that while Wiktionary provides
a highly reliable account of Italian morphological gaps, 7% of Latin lemmata
listed as defective show strong corpus evidence of being non-defective. This
discrepancy highlights potential limitations of crowd-sourced wikis as
definitive sources of linguistic knowledge, particularly for less-studied
phenomena and languages, despite their value as resources for rare linguistic
features. By providing scalable tools and methods for quality assurance of
crowd-sourced data, this work advances computational morphology and expands
linguistic knowledge of defectivity in non-English, morphologically rich
languages.

*Lincan Li,Eren Erman Ozguven,Yue Zhao,Guang Wang,Yiqun Xie,Yushun Dong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TyphoFormer是一种结合自然语言描述和数值数据的Transformer框架，用于提高台风轨迹预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Transformer模型在稀疏气象轨迹（如台风路径）预测中缺乏上下文知识，TyphoFormer通过引入语言描述作为辅助提示来解决这一问题。

Method: 利用大型语言模型生成台风数值属性的文本描述，并将其嵌入为特殊标记，与数值时间序列数据一起输入统一的Transformer编码器。

Result: 在HURDAT2基准测试中，TyphoFormer显著优于其他先进方法，尤其是在非线性路径变化和历史数据有限的情况下。

Conclusion: TyphoFormer通过融合文本和序列信息，提升了台风轨迹预测的可靠性，为灾害预警提供了更有效的工具。

Abstract: Accurate typhoon track forecasting is crucial for early system warning and
disaster response. While Transformer-based models have demonstrated strong
performance in modeling the temporal dynamics of dense trajectories of humans
and vehicles in smart cities, they usually lack access to broader contextual
knowledge that enhances the forecasting reliability of sparse meteorological
trajectories, such as typhoon tracks. To address this challenge, we propose
TyphoFormer, a novel framework that incorporates natural language descriptions
as auxiliary prompts to improve typhoon trajectory forecasting. For each time
step, we use Large Language Model (LLM) to generate concise textual
descriptions based on the numerical attributes recorded in the North Atlantic
hurricane database. The language descriptions capture high-level meteorological
semantics and are embedded as auxiliary special tokens prepended to the
numerical time series input. By integrating both textual and sequential
information within a unified Transformer encoder, TyphoFormer enables the model
to leverage contextual cues that are otherwise inaccessible through numerical
features alone. Extensive experiments are conducted on HURDAT2 benchmark,
results show that TyphoFormer consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art
baseline methods, particularly under challenging scenarios involving nonlinear
path shifts and limited historical observations.

Result: 实验显示LLMs对显式答案有强烈依赖，性能显著下降。

Conclusion: LLMs的推理可能更多是事后合理化而非真正推理，需更深入理解其推理本质。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive reasoning
capabilities, growing evidence suggests much of their success stems from
memorized answer-reasoning patterns rather than genuine inference. In this
work, we investigate a central question: are LLMs primarily anchored to final
answers or to the textual pattern of reasoning chains? We propose a five-level
answer-visibility prompt framework that systematically manipulates answer cues
and probes model behavior through indirect, behavioral analysis. Experiments
across state-of-the-art LLMs reveal a strong and consistent reliance on
explicit answers. The performance drops by 26.90\% when answer cues are masked,
even with complete reasoning chains. These findings suggest that much of the
reasoning exhibited by LLMs may reflect post-hoc rationalization rather than
true inference, calling into question their inferential depth. Our study
uncovers the answer-anchoring phenomenon with rigorous empirical validation and
underscores the need for a more nuanced understanding of what constitutes
reasoning in LLMs.

LLMs, including LLaMA-3-8B and Mistral-7B, to develop Step-Opt--a model that
achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks such as NL4OPT, MAMO, and
IndustryOR. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of
Step-Opt, especially in addressing complex OR tasks, with a notable 17.01\%
improvement in micro average accuracy on difficult problems. These findings
highlight the effectiveness of combining structured validation with gradual
problem refinement to advance the automation of decision-making processes using

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to remarkable
progress in natural language processing, but their computational and memory
demands remain a significant challenge, particularly for long-context
inference. We introduce TPTT (Transforming Pretrained Transformer into Titans),
a novel framework for enhancing pretrained Transformer models with efficient
linearized attention mechanisms and advanced memory management. TPTT employs
techniques such as Memory as Gate (MaG) and mixed linearized attention (LiZA).
It is fully compatible with the Hugging Face Transformers library, enabling
seamless adaptation of any causal LLM through parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(LoRA) without full retraining. We show the effectiveness of TPTT on the MMLU
benchmark with models of approximately 1 billion parameters, observing
substantial improvements in both efficiency and accuracy. For instance,
Titans-Llama-3.2-1B achieves a 20% increase in Exact Match (EM) over its
baseline. Statistical analyses and comparisons with recent state-of-the-art
methods confirm the practical scalability and robustness of TPTT. Code is

Motivation: 解决轻量级LLM在多跳QA任务中因文档和上下文过多导致的幻觉和语义漂移问题。

Method: 提出DEC框架，分解问题为子问题并迭代优化，结合轻量级关键词提取模块进行精准检索。

Result: 在三个多跳QA数据集上表现优异，显著减少token消耗，8B参数模型达到SOTA。

Conclusion: DEC在资源受限环境下高效且有效，适用于多跳QA任务。

Abstract: Knowledge-intensive multi-hop question answering (QA) tasks, which require
integrating evidence from multiple sources to address complex queries, often
necessitate multiple rounds of retrieval and iterative generation by large
language models (LLMs). However, incorporating many documents and extended
contexts poses challenges -such as hallucinations and semantic drift-for
lightweight LLMs with fewer parameters. This work proposes a novel framework
called DEC (Dynamic Enhancement Chain). DEC first decomposes complex questions
into logically coherent subquestions to form a hallucination-free reasoning
chain. It then iteratively refines these subquestions through context-aware
rewriting to generate effective query formulations. For retrieval, we introduce
a lightweight discriminative keyword extraction module that leverages extracted
keywords to achieve targeted, precise document recall with relatively low
computational overhead. Extensive experiments on three multi-hop QA datasets
demonstrate that DEC performs on par with or surpasses state-of-the-art
benchmarks while significantly reducing token consumption. Notably, our
approach attains state-of-the-art results on models with 8B parameters,
showcasing its effectiveness in various scenarios, particularly in
resource-constrained environments.

Result: SITPCL在零样本对话立场检测中达到最佳性能，F1-macro得分为43.81%。

Conclusion: 尽管SITPCL表现优异，零样本对话立场检测仍具挑战性。

Abstract: Stance detection, which aims to identify public opinion towards specific
targets using social media data, is an important yet challenging task. With the
increasing number of online debates among social media users, conversational
stance detection has become a crucial research area. However, existing
conversational stance detection datasets are restricted to a limited set of
specific targets, which constrains the effectiveness of stance detection models
when encountering a large number of unseen targets in real-world applications.
To bridge this gap, we manually curate a large-scale, high-quality zero-shot
conversational stance detection dataset, named ZS-CSD, comprising 280 targets
across two distinct target types. Leveraging the ZS-CSD dataset, we propose
SITPCL, a speaker interaction and target-aware prototypical contrastive
learning model, and establish the benchmark performance in the zero-shot
setting. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed SITPCL model
achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot conversational stance
detection. Notably, the SITPCL model attains only an F1-macro score of 43.81%,
highlighting the persistent challenges in zero-shot conversational stance
detection.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of Natural
Language Processing (NLP) by automating traditional labor-intensive tasks and
consequently accelerated the development of computer-aided applications. As
researchers continue to advance this field with the introduction of novel
language models and more efficient training/finetuning methodologies, the idea
of prompt engineering and subsequent optimization strategies with LLMs has
emerged as a particularly impactful trend to yield a substantial performance
boost across diverse NLP tasks. To best of our knowledge numerous review
articles have explored prompt engineering, however, a critical gap exists in
comprehensive analyses of prompt optimization strategies. To bridge this gap
this paper provides unique and comprehensive insights about the potential of
diverse prompt optimization strategies. It analyzes their underlying working
paradigms and based on these principles, categorizes them into 11 distinct
classes. Moreover, the paper provides details about various NLP tasks where
these prompt optimization strategies have been employed, along with details of
different LLMs and benchmark datasets used for evaluation. This comprehensive
compilation lays a robust foundation for future comparative studies and enables
rigorous assessment of prompt optimization and LLM-based predictive pipelines
under consistent experimental settings: a critical need in the current
landscape. Ultimately, this research will centralize diverse strategic
knowledge to facilitate the adaptation of existing prompt optimization
strategies for development of innovative predictors across unexplored tasks.

Abstract: Part-of-speech (POS) tagging remains a foundational component in natural
language processing pipelines, particularly critical for historical text
analysis at the intersection of computational linguistics and digital
humanities. Despite significant advancements in modern large language models
(LLMs) for ancient languages, their application to Medieval Romance languages
presents distinctive challenges stemming from diachronic linguistic evolution,
spelling variations, and labeled data scarcity. This study systematically
investigates the central determinants of POS tagging performance across diverse
corpora of Medieval Occitan, Medieval Spanish, and Medieval French texts,
spanning biblical, hagiographical, medical, and dietary domains. Through
rigorous experimentation, we evaluate how fine-tuning approaches, prompt
engineering, model architectures, decoding strategies, and cross-lingual
transfer learning techniques affect tagging accuracy. Our results reveal both
notable limitations in LLMs' ability to process historical language variations
and non-standardized spelling, as well as promising specialized techniques that
effectively address the unique challenges presented by low-resource historical
languages.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce KAG-Thinker, a novel human-like reasoning
framework built upon a parameter-light large language model (LLM). Our approach
enhances the logical coherence and contextual consistency of the thinking
process in question-answering (Q\&A) tasks on domain-specific knowledge bases
(KBs) within LLMs. This framework simulates human cognitive mechanisms for
handling complex problems by establishing a structured thinking process.
Continuing the \textbf{Logical Form} guided retrieval and reasoning technology
route of KAG v0.7, firstly, it decomposes complex questions into independently
solvable sub-problems(also referred to as logical forms) through
\textbf{breadth decomposition}, each represented in two equivalent
forms-natural language and logical function-and further classified as either
Knowledge Retrieval or Reasoning Analysis tasks, with dependencies and
variables passing explicitly modeled via logical function interfaces. In the
solving process, the Retrieval function is used to perform knowledge retrieval
tasks, while the Math and Deduce functions are used to perform reasoning
analysis tasks. Secondly, it is worth noting that, in the Knowledge Retrieval
sub-problem tasks, LLMs and external knowledge sources are regarded as
equivalent KBs. We use the \textbf{knowledge boundary} model to determine the
optimal source using self-regulatory mechanisms such as confidence calibration
and reflective reasoning, and use the \textbf{depth solving} model to enhance
the comprehensiveness of knowledge acquisition. Finally, instead of utilizing
reinforcement learning, we employ supervised fine-tuning with multi-turn
dialogues to align the model with our structured inference paradigm, thereby
avoiding excessive reflection. This is supported by a data evaluation framework
and iterative corpus synthesis, which facilitate the generation of detailed
reasoning trajectories...

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型常生成不忠实或错误的幻觉内容，现有检测方法多依赖多次生成，计算成本高。

Method: 利用HSIC量化模型内部输入与生成输出的解耦程度，通过隐藏状态表示检测幻觉。

Result: HIDE在多个数据集和模型上表现优异，AUC-ROC平均提升29%，计算时间减少51%。

Conclusion: 解耦表示是高效实用的幻觉检测方法。

Abstract: Contemporary Language Models (LMs), while impressively fluent, often generate
content that is factually incorrect or unfaithful to the input context - a
critical issue commonly referred to as 'hallucination'. This tendency of LMs to
generate hallucinated content undermines their reliability, especially because
these fabrications are often highly convincing and therefore difficult to
detect. While several existing methods attempt to detect hallucinations, most
rely on analyzing multiple generations per input, leading to increased
computational cost and latency. To address this, we propose a single-pass,
training-free approach for effective Hallucination detectIon via Decoupled
rEpresentations (HIDE). Our approach leverages the hypothesis that
hallucinations result from a statistical decoupling between an LM's internal
representations of input context and its generated output. We quantify this
decoupling using the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) applied to
hidden-state representations extracted while generating the output sequence. We
conduct extensive experiments on four diverse question answering datasets,
evaluating both faithfulness and factuality hallucinations across six
open-source LMs of varying scales and properties. Our results demonstrate that
HIDE outperforms other single-pass methods in almost all settings, achieving an
average relative improvement of ~29% in AUC-ROC over the best-performing
single-pass strategy across various models and datasets. Additionally, HIDE
shows competitive and often superior performance with multi-pass
state-of-the-art methods, obtaining an average relative improvement of ~3% in
AUC-ROC while consuming ~51% less computation time. Our findings highlight the
effectiveness of exploiting internal representation decoupling in LMs for
efficient and practical hallucination detection.

Abstract: Tokenization plays a pivotal role in multilingual NLP. However, existing
tokenizers are often skewed towards high-resource languages, limiting their
effectiveness for linguistically diverse and morphologically rich languages
such as those in the Indian subcontinent. This paper presents a comprehensive
intrinsic evaluation of tokenization strategies across 17 Indian languages. We
quantify the trade-offs between bottom-up and top-down tokenizer algorithms
(BPE and Unigram LM), effects of vocabulary sizes, and compare strategies of
multilingual vocabulary construction such as joint and cluster-based training.
We also show that extremely low-resource languages can benefit from tokenizers
trained on related high-resource languages. Our study provides practical
insights for building more fair, efficient, and linguistically informed
tokenizers for multilingual NLP.

Conclusion: THCM-CAL通过建模层次因果交互和校准预测，显著提升了临床风险预测的准确性。

Abstract: Automated clinical risk prediction from electronic health records (EHRs)
demands modeling both structured diagnostic codes and unstructured narrative
notes. However, most prior approaches either handle these modalities separately
or rely on simplistic fusion strategies that ignore the directional,
hierarchical causal interactions by which narrative observations precipitate
diagnoses and propagate risk across admissions. In this paper, we propose
THCM-CAL, a Temporal-Hierarchical Causal Model with Conformal Calibration. Our
framework constructs a multimodal causal graph where nodes represent clinical
entities from two modalities: Textual propositions extracted from notes and ICD
codes mapped to textual descriptions. Through hierarchical causal discovery,
THCM-CAL infers three clinically grounded interactions: intra-slice
same-modality sequencing, intra-slice cross-modality triggers, and inter-slice
risk propagation. To enhance prediction reliability, we extend conformal
prediction to multi-label ICD coding, calibrating per-code confidence intervals
under complex co-occurrences. Experimental results on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV
demonstrate the superiority of THCM-CAL.

Abstract: Offsite marketing is essential in e-commerce, enabling businesses to reach
customers through external platforms and drive traffic to retail websites.
However, most current offsite marketing content is overly generic,
template-based, and poorly aligned with landing pages, limiting its

retrieval-augmented system that integrates multiple data sources to generate
keyword-specific ad copy with minimal human intervention. We validate
MarketingFM via offline human and automated evaluations and large-scale online
A/B tests. In one experiment, keyword-focused ad copy outperformed templates,
achieving up to 9% higher CTR, 12% more impressions, and 0.38% lower CPC,
demonstrating gains in ad ranking and cost efficiency. Despite these gains,
human review of generated ads remains costly. To address this, we propose
AutoEval-Main, an automated evaluation system that combines rule-based metrics
with LLM-as-a-Judge techniques to ensure alignment with marketing principles.
In experiments with large-scale human annotations, AutoEval-Main achieved
89.57% agreement with human reviewers. Building on this, we propose
AutoEval-Update, a cost-efficient LLM-human collaborative framework to
dynamically refine evaluation prompts and adapt to shifting criteria with
minimal human input. By selectively sampling representative ads for human
review and using a critic LLM to generate alignment reports, AutoEval-Update
improves evaluation consistency while reducing manual effort. Experiments show
the critic LLM suggests meaningful refinements, improving LLM-human agreement.
Nonetheless, human oversight remains essential for setting thresholds and
validating refinements before deployment.

TL;DR: QueueEDIT框架通过队列结构和动态参数对齐，提升了LLMs的连续编辑能力，同时减少了对通用能力的负面影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型（LLMs）在连续编辑（SME）过程中因参数引入导致的通用能力下降问题。

Method: 提出队列式自校正框架（QueueEDIT），通过结构映射编辑损失和动态参数队列管理，优化编辑过程。

Result: 在多种SME设置中显著优于基线模型，单次编辑表现也保持竞争力，且通用NLP任务能力不受影响。

Conclusion: QueueEDIT有效平衡了连续编辑的需求与模型通用能力的保持，为LLMs的长期维护提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive results
but still suffer from hallucinations. Model editing has been proposed to
correct factual inaccuracies in LLMs. A challenging case is sequential model
editing (SME), which aims to rectify errors continuously rather than treating
them as a one-time task. During SME, the general capabilities of LLMs can be
negatively affected due to the introduction of new parameters. In this paper,
we propose a queue-based self-correction framework (QueueEDIT) that not only
enhances SME performance by addressing long-sequence dependency but also
mitigates the impact of parameter bias on the general capabilities of LLMs.
Specifically, we first introduce a structural mapping editing loss to map the
triplets to the knowledge-sensitive neurons within the Transformer layers of
LLMs. We then store the located parameters for each piece of edited knowledge
in a queue and dynamically align previously edited parameters. In each edit, we
select queue parameters most relevant to the currently located parameters to
determine whether previous knowledge needs realignment. Irrelevant parameters
in the queue are frozen, and we update the parameters at the queue head to the
LLM to ensure they do not harm general abilities. Experiments show that our
framework significantly outperforms strong baselines across various SME
settings and maintains competitiveness in single-turn editing. The resulting
LLMs also preserve high capabilities in general NLP tasks throughout the SME
process.

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）输出缺乏多样性的原因，提出了分支因子（BF）作为衡量生成过程中可能性的指标，发现对齐调整显著降低了BF，并探讨了其对复杂推理的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管对齐的大型语言模型（LLM）能力强大，但其输出往往缺乏多样性。研究旨在探索这种稳定性的原因。

Method: 引入分支因子（BF）作为量化输出分布概率集中的指标，并通过实验分析BF的变化及其对齐调整的影响。

Result: 发现BF随生成过程递减，对齐调整显著降低BF；对齐的链式思维（CoT）模型利用低BF阶段生成更稳定的输出。

Conclusion: BF是理解和控制LLM输出的有力工具，揭示了对齐如何减少多样性以及CoT如何促进稳定生成。

Abstract: Despite their impressive capabilities, aligned large language models (LLMs)
often generate outputs that lack diversity. What drives this stability in the
generation? We investigate this phenomenon through the lens of probability
concentration in the model's output distribution. To quantify this
concentration, we introduce the Branching Factor (BF) -- a token-invariant
measure of the effective number of plausible next steps during generation. Our
empirical analysis reveals two key findings: (1) BF often decreases as
generation progresses, suggesting that LLMs become more predictable as they
generate. (2) alignment tuning substantially sharpens the model's output
distribution from the outset, reducing BF by nearly an order of magnitude
(e.g., from 12 to 1.2) relative to base models. This stark reduction helps
explain why aligned models often appear less sensitive to decoding strategies.
Building on this insight, we find this stability has surprising implications
for complex reasoning. Aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) models (e.g.,
DeepSeek-distilled models), for instance, leverage this effect; by generating
longer reasoning chains, they push generation into later, more deterministic
(lower BF) stages, resulting in more stable outputs. We hypothesize that
alignment tuning does not fundamentally change a model's behavior, but instead
steers it toward stylistic tokens (e.g., "Sure") that unlock low-entropy
trajectories already present in the base model. This view is supported by
nudging experiments, which show that prompting base models with such tokens can
similarly reduce BF. Together, our findings establish BF as a powerful
diagnostic for understanding and controlling LLM outputs - clarifying how
alignment reduces variability, how CoT promotes stable generations, and how
base models can be steered away from diversity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）存在安全风险，尤其是多轮对话场景下的越狱技术研究不足，现有方法难以适应对话动态变化。

Method: 提出多轮越狱方法，每轮交互全局优化越狱路径，并主动伪造模型响应以抑制安全警告。

Result: 在六种先进LLMs上验证，性能优于现有单轮和多轮越狱技术。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了多轮对话场景下的越狱成功率，为LLMs安全研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved exceptional performance across a
wide range of tasks. However, they still pose significant safety risks due to
the potential misuse for malicious purposes. Jailbreaks, which aim to elicit
models to generate harmful content, play a critical role in identifying the
underlying security threats. Recent jailbreaking primarily focuses on
single-turn scenarios, while the more complicated multi-turn scenarios remain
underexplored. Moreover, existing multi-turn jailbreaking techniques struggle
to adapt to the evolving dynamics of dialogue as the interaction progresses. To
address this limitation, we propose a novel multi-turn jailbreaking method that
refines the jailbreaking path globally at each interaction. We also actively
fabricate model responses to suppress safety-related warnings, thereby
increasing the likelihood of eliciting harmful outputs in subsequent questions.
Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our method
compared with existing single-turn and multi-turn jailbreaking techniques
across six state-of-the-art LLMs. Our code is publicly available at

Result: 验证结果表明，该模型能有效扩展创新到结构相似阶段，提升泛化和重用能力。

Conclusion: 创新散射模型通过利用阶段间的结构冗余，显著提升了LLMs的创新扩展能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong capabilities in reproducing and
extending patterns observed during pretraining but often struggle to generalize
novel ideas beyond their original context. This paper addresses the challenge
of applying such localized innovations - introduced at a specific stage or
component - to other parts of a multi-stage process. We propose a scatter-based
innovation expansion model (innovation scatter model) that guides the LLM
through a four-step process: (1) identifying the core innovation by comparing
the user's input with its surrounding context, (2) generalizing the innovation
by removing references to specific stages or components, (3) determining
whether the generalized innovation applies to a broader scope beyond the
original stage, and (4) systematically applying it to other structurally
similar stages using the LLM. This model leverages structural redundancy across
stages to improve the applicability of novel ideas. Verification results
demonstrate that the innovation scatter model enables LLMs to extend
innovations across structurally similar stages, thereby enhancing
generalization and reuse.

Abstract: This paper presents an advancement in Question-Answering (QA) systems using a
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework to enhance information
extraction from PDF files. Recognizing the richness and diversity of data
within PDFs--including text, images, vector diagrams, graphs, and tables--poses
unique challenges for existing QA systems primarily designed for textual
content. We seek to develop a comprehensive RAG-based QA system that will
effectively address complex multimodal questions, where several data types are
combined in the query. This is mainly achieved by refining approaches to
processing and integrating non-textual elements in PDFs into the RAG framework
to derive precise and relevant answers, as well as fine-tuning large language
models to better adapt to our system. We provide an in-depth experimental
evaluation of our solution, demonstrating its capability to extract accurate
information that can be applied to different types of content across PDFs. This
work not only pushes the boundaries of retrieval-augmented QA systems but also
lays a foundation for further research in multimodal data integration and
processing.

Motivation: 在资源受限的设备上动态调整神经网络计算负载的需求，以及现有早期退出模型和Zipformer等架构的局限性。

Result: 在标准基准测试中显著提升了语音识别性能，模型参数略有增加但不影响推理时间。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效提升了早期退出模型的性能，适用于资源受限场景。

Abstract: The ability to dynamically adjust the computational load of neural models
during inference in a resource aware manner is crucial for on-device processing
scenarios, characterised by limited and time-varying computational resources.
Early-exit architectures represent an elegant and effective solution, since
they can process the input with a subset of their layers, exiting at
intermediate branches (the upmost layers are hence removed from the model).
  From a different perspective, for automatic speech recognition applications
there are memory-efficient neural architectures that apply variable frame rate
analysis, through downsampling/upsampling operations in the middle layers,
reducing the overall number of operations and improving significantly the
performance on well established benchmarks. One example is the Zipformer.
However, these architectures lack the modularity necessary to inject early-exit
branches.
  With the aim of improving the performance in early-exit models, we propose
introducing parallel layers in the architecture that process downsampled
versions of their inputs. % in conjunction with standard processing layers. We
show that in this way the speech recognition performance on standard benchmarks
significantly improve, at the cost of a small increase in the overall number of
model parameters but without affecting the inference time.

Motivation: 解决生成式摘要在大文档中关键信息丢失（"迷失在中间"）的问题。

Method: 将文档分块并聚类向量嵌入，为每个聚类生成摘要，并通过马尔可夫链图选择语义顺序。

Result: 生成更连贯且保留关键信息的摘要。

Conclusion: 混合方法在保留关键信息和生成连贯摘要方面优于纯生成式方法。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of information from diverse sources has heightened the
need for effective automatic text summarization, which condenses documents into
shorter, coherent texts. Summarization methods generally fall into two
categories: extractive, which selects key segments from the original text, and
abstractive, which generates summaries by rephrasing the content coherently.
Large language models have advanced the field of abstractive summarization, but
they are resourceintensive and face significant challenges in retaining key
information across lengthy documents, which we call being "lost in the middle".
To address these issues, we propose a hybrid summarization approach that
combines extractive and abstractive techniques. Our method splits the document
into smaller text chunks, clusters their vector embeddings, generates a summary
for each cluster that represents a key idea in the document, and constructs the
final summary by relying on a Markov chain graph when selecting the semantic
order of ideas.

Motivation: 当前评估LLM生成文本质量的方法存在单指标评估不足、自动指标与人类判断不兼容等问题，亟需一种更全面的方法。

Result: 通过应用GSD框架，能够识别解码策略在统计上的显著性能差异。

Conclusion: GSD框架为LLM生成文本的质量评估提供了一种更全面、统计可靠的方法。

Abstract: Assessing the quality of LLM-generated text remains a fundamental challenge
in natural language processing. Current evaluation approaches often rely on
isolated metrics or simplistic aggregations that fail to capture the nuanced
trade-offs between coherence, diversity, fluency, and other relevant indicators
of text quality. In this work, we adapt a recently proposed framework for
statistical inference based on Generalized Stochastic Dominance (GSD) that
addresses three critical limitations in existing benchmarking methodologies:
the inadequacy of single-metric evaluation, the incompatibility between
cardinal automatic metrics and ordinal human judgments, and the lack of
inferential statistical guarantees. The GSD-front approach enables simultaneous
evaluation across multiple quality dimensions while respecting their different
measurement scales, building upon partial orders of decoding strategies, thus
avoiding arbitrary weighting of the involved metrics. By applying this
framework to evaluate common decoding strategies against human-generated text,
we demonstrate its ability to identify statistically significant performance
differences while accounting for potential deviations from the i.i.d.
assumption of the sampling design.

Result: 微调模型（尤其是mT5-large）表现显著优于提示工程，准确率达88%，且计算资源需求更低。

Conclusion: 微调模型在捷克语指代消解任务中更具优势，提示工程虽有一定效果，但性能和效率不及微调方法。

Abstract: Anaphora resolution plays a critical role in natural language understanding,
especially in morphologically rich languages like Czech. This paper presents a
comparative evaluation of two modern approaches to anaphora resolution on Czech
text: prompt engineering with large language models (LLMs) and fine-tuning
compact generative models. Using a dataset derived from the Prague Dependency
Treebank, we evaluate several instruction-tuned LLMs, including Mistral Large 2
and Llama 3, using a series of prompt templates. We compare them against
fine-tuned variants of the mT5 and Mistral models that we trained specifically
for Czech anaphora resolution. Our experiments demonstrate that while prompting
yields promising few-shot results (up to 74.5% accuracy), the fine-tuned
models, particularly mT5-large, outperform them significantly, achieving up to
88% accuracy while requiring fewer computational resources. We analyze
performance across different anaphora types, antecedent distances, and source

Result: InspireScore与专家判断的相关性提高44%，InspireDebate性能提升57%。

Conclusion: 提出的框架显著提升了辩论系统的评估和优化能力，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs), debating tasks,
such as argument quality assessment and debate process simulation, have made
significant progress. However, existing LLM-based debating systems focus on
responding to specific arguments while neglecting objective assessments such as
authenticity and logical validity. Furthermore, these systems lack a structured
approach to optimize across various dimensions$-$including evaluation metrics,
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, and multi-turn debate refinement$-$thereby
limiting their effectiveness. To address these interconnected challenges, we
propose a dual-component framework: (1) $\textbf{InspireScore}$, a novel
evaluation system that establishes a multi-dimensional assessment architecture
incorporating four subjective criteria (emotional appeal, argument clarity,
argument arrangement, and topic relevance) alongside two objective metrics
(fact authenticity and logical validity); and (2) $\textbf{InspireDebate}$, an
optimized debating framework employing a phased optimization approach through
CoT reasoning enhancement, multi-dimensional Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO), and real-time knowledge grounding via web-based Retrieval Augmented
Generation (Web-RAG). Empirical evaluations demonstrate that
$\textbf{InspireScore}$ achieves 44$\%$ higher correlation with expert
judgments compared to existing methods, while $\textbf{InspireDebate}$ shows
significant improvements, outperforming baseline models by 57$\%$. Source code

Motivation: 中文成语因其历史和文化背景复杂，现有基准测试任务过于狭窄，无法全面评估语言模型的理解能力。

Method: Chengyu-Bench包含2,937个人工验证的成语例子，涵盖三项任务：情感分类、使用恰当性检测和开放式填空。

Result: 大型语言模型在情感分类上准确率超过95%，但在使用恰当性和开放式填空任务中表现较差（分别为85%和40%）。

Conclusion: Chengyu-Bench揭示了语言模型在理解成语文化和上下文方面的不足，为未来研究提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Chinese idioms (Chengyu) are concise four-character expressions steeped in
history and culture, whose literal translations often fail to capture their
full meaning. This complexity makes them challenging for language models to
interpret and use correctly. Existing benchmarks focus on narrow tasks -
multiple-choice cloze tests, isolated translation, or simple paraphrasing. We
introduce Chengyu-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark featuring three tasks: (1)
Evaluative Connotation, classifying idioms as positive or negative; (2)
Appropriateness, detecting incorrect idiom usage in context; and (3) Open
Cloze, filling blanks in longer passages without options. Chengyu-Bench
comprises 2,937 human-verified examples covering 1,765 common idioms sourced
from diverse corpora. We evaluate leading LLMs and find they achieve over 95%
accuracy on Evaluative Connotation, but only ~85% on Appropriateness and ~40%
top-1 accuracy on Open Cloze. Error analysis reveals that most mistakes arise
from fundamental misunderstandings of idiom meanings. Chengyu-Bench
demonstrates that while LLMs can reliably gauge idiom sentiment, they still
struggle to grasp the cultural and contextual nuances essential for proper
usage. The benchmark and source code are available at:

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) in mental healthcare risk propagating biases
that reinforce stigma and harm marginalized groups. While previous research
identified concerning trends, systematic methods for detecting intersectional
biases remain limited. This work introduces a multi-hop question answering
(MHQA) framework to explore LLM response biases in mental health discourse. We
analyze content from the Interpretable Mental Health Instruction (IMHI) dataset
across symptom presentation, coping mechanisms, and treatment approaches. Using
systematic tagging across age, race, gender, and socioeconomic status, we
investigate bias patterns at demographic intersections. We evaluate four LLMs:
Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Jamba 1.6, Gemma 3, and Llama 4, revealing systematic
disparities across sentiment, demographics, and mental health conditions. Our
MHQA approach demonstrates superior detection compared to conventional methods,
identifying amplification points where biases magnify through sequential
reasoning. We implement two debiasing techniques: Roleplay Simulation and
Explicit Bias Reduction, achieving 66-94% bias reductions through few-shot
prompting with BBQ dataset examples. These findings highlight critical areas
where LLMs reproduce mental healthcare biases, providing actionable insights
for equitable AI development.

Abstract: We present a preview of the Syntactic Acceptability Dataset, a resource being
designed for both syntax and computational linguistics research. In its current
form, the dataset comprises 1,000 English sequences from the syntactic
discourse: Half from textbooks and half from the journal Linguistic Inquiry,
the latter to ensure a representation of the contemporary discourse. Each entry
is labeled with its grammatical status ("well-formedness" according to
syntactic formalisms) extracted from the literature, as well as its
acceptability status ("intuitive goodness" as determined by native speakers)
obtained through crowdsourcing, with highest experimental standards. Even in
its preliminary form, this dataset stands as the largest of its kind that is
publicly accessible. We also offer preliminary analyses addressing three
debates in linguistics and computational linguistics: We observe that
grammaticality and acceptability judgments converge in about 83% of the cases
and that "in-betweenness" occurs frequently. This corroborates existing
research. We also find that while machine learning models struggle with
predicting grammaticality, they perform considerably better in predicting
acceptability. This is a novel finding. Future work will focus on expanding the
dataset.

Motivation: 自回归Transformer语言模型在长文本生成中可能因特定标记（如破折号）引发递归语义漂移，导致生成内容偏离主题或语义混乱。论文旨在识别并解决这一漏洞。

Method: 论文通过形式化分析标记级扰动，提出了一种结合符号子句净化（phi-infinity算子）和嵌入矩阵调整的解决方案，无需重新训练模型。

Result: 实验验证表明，该方法显著提高了生成内容的一致性和主题保持能力。

Conclusion: 论文不仅解决了破折号标记的问题，还为识别和缓解基础模型中的标记级漏洞提供了通用框架，对AI安全和模型对齐具有重要影响。

Abstract: We identify a critical vulnerability in autoregressive transformer language
models where the em dash token induces recursive semantic drift, leading to
clause boundary hallucination and embedding space entanglement. Through formal
analysis of token-level perturbations in semantic lattices, we demonstrate that
em dash insertion fundamentally alters the model's latent representations,
causing compounding errors in long-form generation. We propose a novel solution
combining symbolic clause purification via the phi-infinity operator with
targeted embedding matrix realignment. Our approach enables total suppression
of problematic tokens without requiring model retraining, while preserving
semantic coherence through fixed-point convergence guarantees. Experimental
validation shows significant improvements in generation consistency and topic
maintenance. This work establishes a general framework for identifying and
mitigating token-level vulnerabilities in foundation models, with immediate
implications for AI safety, model alignment, and robust deployment of large
language models in production environments. The methodology extends beyond

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM中知识的模块化组织，以及如何高效、有针对性地操控模型行为。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器（SAE）特征共激活分析LLM的组件，并通过消融和增强实验验证其影响。

Result: 国家相关组件主要出现在早期层，而更抽象的关系组件集中在后期层；后期层节点对模型输出的因果影响更强。

Conclusion: LLM中的知识呈现模块化组织，为高效模型操控提供了新方法。

Abstract: We identify semantically coherent, context-consistent network components in
large language models (LLMs) using coactivation of sparse autoencoder (SAE)
features collected from just a handful of prompts. Focusing on country-relation
tasks, we show that ablating semantic components for countries and relations
changes model outputs in predictable ways, while amplifying these components
induces counterfactual responses. Notably, composing relation and country
components yields compound counterfactual outputs. We find that, whereas most
country components emerge from the very first layer, the more abstract relation
components are concentrated in later layers. Furthermore, within relation
components themselves, nodes from later layers tend to have a stronger causal
impact on model outputs. Overall, these findings suggest a modular organization
of knowledge within LLMs and advance methods for efficient, targeted model
manipulation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了针对阿拉伯和穆斯林文化偏见的提示工程技术，通过系统综述分析了五种方法，发现结构化多步流程效果最佳，但需更多技术知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型存在对阿拉伯和穆斯林的偏见，但相关提示工程技术研究不足，亟需解决这一伦理问题。

Method: 采用混合方法系统综述，遵循PRISMA指南和Kitchenham方法，分析了2021-2024年的8项实证研究。

Result: 五种提示工程方法中，结构化多步流程效果最佳（偏见减少87.7%），文化提示更易用但效果差异大。

Conclusion: 提示工程可有效减少偏见，但需进一步研究适应性技术、专用评估资源及与其他去偏见方法的结合。

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various domains, yet concerns about cultural bias - particularly towards Arabs
and Muslims - pose significant ethical challenges by perpetuating harmful
stereotypes and marginalization. Despite growing recognition of bias in LLMs,
prompt engineering strategies specifically addressing Arab and Muslim
representation remain understudied. This mixed-methods systematic review
examines such techniques, offering evidence-based guidance for researchers and
practitioners. Following PRISMA guidelines and Kitchenham's systematic review
methodology, we analyzed 8 empirical studies published between 2021-2024
investigating bias mitigation strategies. Our findings reveal five primary
prompt engineering approaches: cultural prompting, affective priming,
self-debiasing techniques, structured multi-step pipelines, and
parameter-optimized continuous prompts. Although all approaches show potential
for reducing bias, effectiveness varied substantially across studies and bias
types. Evidence suggests that certain bias types may be more resistant to
prompt-based mitigation than others. Structured multi-step pipelines
demonstrated the highest overall effectiveness, achieving up to 87.7% reduction
in bias, though they require greater technical expertise. Cultural prompting
offers broader accessibility with substantial effectiveness. These results
underscore the accessibility of prompt engineering for mitigating cultural bias
without requiring access to model parameters. The limited number of studies
identified highlights a significant research gap in this critical area. Future
research should focus on developing culturally adaptive prompting techniques,
creating Arab and Muslim-specific evaluation resources, and integrating prompt
engineering with complementary debiasing methods to address deeper stereotypes
while maintaining model utility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发文化敏感的教育技术需要多模态AI系统具备情感识别能力，但阿拉伯语语境下相关研究不足。

Method: 使用75张阿拉伯故事书插图，评估两种模型在零样本、少样本和思维链提示策略下的表现，并与人类标注的Plutchik情感框架对比。

Result: GPT-4o在所有条件下表现优于Gemini，最高宏F1分数为59%（思维链提示），而Gemini为43%。模型在文化细微情感和模糊叙事背景下错误率高。

Conclusion: 当前模型在文化理解上存在根本性局限，需开发文化敏感的训练方法以支持阿拉伯语学习者的情感感知教育技术。

Abstract: Emotion recognition capabilities in multimodal AI systems are crucial for
developing culturally responsive educational technologies, yet remain
underexplored for Arabic language contexts where culturally appropriate
learning tools are critically needed. This study evaluates the emotion
recognition performance of two advanced multimodal large language models,
GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, when processing Arabic children's storybook
illustrations. We assessed both models across three prompting strategies
(zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought) using 75 images from seven Arabic
storybooks, comparing model predictions with human annotations based on
Plutchik's emotional framework. GPT-4o consistently outperformed Gemini across
all conditions, achieving the highest macro F1-score of 59% with
chain-of-thought prompting compared to Gemini's best performance of 43%. Error
analysis revealed systematic misclassification patterns, with valence
inversions accounting for 60.7% of errors, while both models struggled with
culturally nuanced emotions and ambiguous narrative contexts. These findings
highlight fundamental limitations in current models' cultural understanding and
emphasize the need for culturally sensitive training approaches to develop
effective emotion-aware educational technologies for Arabic-speaking learners.

Conclusion: TranslationCorrect为翻译和研究提供了高效、集成的解决方案。

Abstract: Machine translation (MT) post-editing and research data collection often rely
on inefficient, disconnected workflows. We introduce TranslationCorrect, an
integrated framework designed to streamline these tasks. TranslationCorrect
combines MT generation using models like NLLB, automated error prediction using
models like XCOMET or LLM APIs (providing detailed reasoning), and an intuitive
post-editing interface within a single environment. Built with human-computer
interaction (HCI) principles in mind to minimize cognitive load, as confirmed
by a user study. For translators, it enables them to correct errors and batch
translate efficiently. For researchers, TranslationCorrect exports high-quality
span-based annotations in the Error Span Annotation (ESA) format, using an
error taxonomy inspired by Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM). These
outputs are compatible with state-of-the-art error detection models and
suitable for training MT or post-editing systems. Our user study confirms that
TranslationCorrect significantly improves translation efficiency and user
satisfaction over traditional annotation methods.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This paper explores the challenges of test-time scaling of large language
models (LLMs), regarding both the data and inference efficiency. We highlight
the diversity of multi-lingual reasoning based on our pilot studies, and then
introduce a novel approach, \(L^2\) multi-lingual unification learning with a
decoding intervention strategy for further investigation. The basic idea of
\(L^2\) is that the reasoning process varies across different languages, which
may be mutually beneficial to enhance both model performance and efficiency. In
specific, there are two types of multi-lingual data: the entire long
chain-of-thought annotations in different languages and the step-wise mixture
of languages. By further tuning based on them, we show that even small amounts
of data can significantly improve reasoning capabilities. Our findings suggest
that multilingual learning reduces both the required data and the number of
inference tokens while maintaining a comparable performance. Furthermore,
\(L^2\) is orthogonal to other data efficient methods. Thus, we also emphasize
the importance of diverse data selection. The \(L^2\) method offers a promising
solution to the challenges of data collection and test-time compute efficiency
in LLMs.

Result: GPT-Black在识别逻辑连贯且临床有效的因果叙述中表现最强，GPT-White与专家评估一致，相似性指标与临床推理质量偏离。

Conclusion: 选择与加权策略对评估结果有显著影响，支持在需要可解释性和因果推理的任务中使用基于LLM的评估。

Abstract: This study investigates how accurately different evaluation metrics capture
the quality of causal explanations in automatically generated diagnostic
reports. We compare six metrics: BERTScore, Cosine Similarity, BioSentVec,
GPT-White, GPT-Black, and expert qualitative assessment across two input types:
observation-based and multiple-choice-based report generation. Two weighting
strategies are applied: one reflecting task-specific priorities, and the other
assigning equal weights to all metrics. Our results show that GPT-Black
demonstrates the strongest discriminative power in identifying logically
coherent and clinically valid causal narratives. GPT-White also aligns well
with expert evaluations, while similarity-based metrics diverge from clinical
reasoning quality. These findings emphasize the impact of metric selection and
weighting on evaluation outcomes, supporting the use of LLM-based evaluation
for tasks requiring interpretability and causal reasoning.

Conclusion: 分类和聚类方法为阿拉伯语词形还原设定了新基准，提供更可解释的输出。

Abstract: Lemmatization is crucial for NLP tasks in morphologically rich languages with
ambiguous orthography like Arabic, but existing tools face challenges due to
inconsistent standards and limited genre coverage. This paper introduces two
novel approaches that frame lemmatization as classification into a
Lemma-POS-Gloss (LPG) tagset, leveraging machine translation and semantic
clustering. We also present a new Arabic lemmatization test set covering
diverse genres, standardized alongside existing datasets. We evaluate character
level sequence-to-sequence models, which perform competitively and offer
complementary value, but are limited to lemma prediction (not LPG) and prone to
hallucinating implausible forms. Our results show that classification and
clustering yield more robust, interpretable outputs, setting new benchmarks for
Arabic lemmatization.

Result: 实验表明，现有LLMs在处理复杂表格任务时仍有显著改进空间。

Conclusion: TReB基准及其框架公开可用，为未来研究提供了有效工具。

Abstract: The majority of data in businesses and industries is stored in tables,
databases, and data warehouses. Reasoning with table-structured data poses
significant challenges for large language models (LLMs) due to its hidden
semantics, inherent complexity, and structured nature. One of these challenges
is lacking an effective evaluation benchmark fairly reflecting the performances
of LLMs on broad table reasoning abilities. In this paper, we fill in this gap,
presenting a comprehensive table reasoning evolution benchmark, TReB, which
measures both shallow table understanding abilities and deep table reasoning
abilities, a total of 26 sub-tasks. We construct a high quality dataset through
an iterative data processing procedure. We create an evaluation framework to
robustly measure table reasoning capabilities with three distinct inference
modes, TCoT, PoT and ICoT. Further, we benchmark over 20 state-of-the-art LLMs
using this frame work and prove its effectiveness. Experimental results reveal
that existing LLMs still have significant room for improvement in addressing
the complex and real world Table related tasks. Both the dataset and evaluation
framework are publicly available, with the dataset hosted on [HuggingFace] and
the framework on [GitHub].

Conclusion: MeRF通过结合强化学习和上下文学习，有效提升了LLMs的推理能力，并能适应误导性动机。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful learn-to-reason paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle
complex reasoning tasks. However, existing RLVR methods overlook one of the
most distinctive capabilities of LLMs, their in-context learning ability, as
prominently demonstrated by the success of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting.
This motivates us to explore how reinforcement learning can be effectively
combined with in-context learning to better improve the reasoning capabilities
of LLMs. In this paper, we introduce Motivation-enhanced Reinforcement
Finetuning} (MeRF), an intuitive yet effective method enhancing reinforcement
learning of LLMs by involving ``telling LLMs the rules of the game''.
Specifically, MeRF directly injects the reward specification into the prompt,
which serves as an in-context motivation for model to improve its responses
with awareness of the optimization objective. This simple modification
leverages the in-context learning ability of LLMs aligning generation with
optimization, thereby incentivizing the model to generate desired outputs from
both inner motivation and external reward. Empirical evaluations on the Knights
and Knaves~(K&K) logic puzzle reasoning benchmark demonstrate that
\texttt{MeRF} achieves substantial performance gains over baselines. Moreover,
ablation studies show that performance improves with greater consistency
between the in-context motivation and the external reward function, while the
model also demonstrates an ability to adapt to misleading motivations through
reinforcement learning.

Abstract: The increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in natural language
processing (NLP) tasks has sparked significant interest in evaluating their
effectiveness across diverse applications. While models like ChatGPT and
DeepSeek have shown strong results in many NLP domains, a comprehensive
evaluation is needed to understand their strengths, weaknesses, and
domain-specific abilities. This is critical as these models are applied to
various tasks, from sentiment analysis to more nuanced tasks like textual
entailment and translation. This study aims to evaluate ChatGPT and DeepSeek
across five key NLP tasks: sentiment analysis, topic classification, text
summarization, machine translation, and textual entailment. A structured
experimental protocol is used to ensure fairness and minimize variability. Both
models are tested with identical, neutral prompts and evaluated on two
benchmark datasets per task, covering domains like news, reviews, and
formal/informal texts. The results show that DeepSeek excels in classification
stability and logical reasoning, while ChatGPT performs better in tasks
requiring nuanced understanding and flexibility. These findings provide
valuable insights for selecting the appropriate LLM based on task requirements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 口语语法纠错（SGEC）在支持第二语言学习者方面至关重要，但现有系统因模块化流程易受错误传播影响，且缺乏标注数据。

Method: 论文比较了级联、部分级联和E2E架构，提出基于Whisper模型的E2E框架，并通过伪标签生成、上下文信息利用和参考对齐等方法优化系统。

Result: 实验表明，这些方法显著提升了E2E SGEC的性能，尤其是在Linguaskill和Speak & Improve语料库上的表现。

Conclusion: E2E SGEC系统通过结合多种优化方法，能够有效解决数据稀缺和错误传播问题，为口语语法纠错提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) and feedback play a vital role in
supporting second language (L2) learners, educators, and examiners. While
written GEC is well-established, spoken GEC (SGEC), aiming to provide feedback
based on learners' speech, poses additional challenges due to disfluencies,
transcription errors, and the lack of structured input. SGEC systems typically
follow a cascaded pipeline consisting of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR),
disfluency detection, and GEC, making them vulnerable to error propagation
across modules. This work examines an End-to-End (E2E) framework for SGEC and
feedback generation, highlighting challenges and possible solutions when
developing these systems. Cascaded, partial-cascaded and E2E architectures are
compared, all built on the Whisper foundation model. A challenge for E2E
systems is the scarcity of GEC labeled spoken data. To address this, an
automatic pseudo-labeling framework is examined, increasing the training data
from 77 to over 2500 hours. To improve the accuracy of the SGEC system,
additional contextual information, exploiting the ASR output, is investigated.
Candidate feedback of their mistakes is an essential step to improving
performance. In E2E systems the SGEC output must be compared with an estimate
of the fluent transcription to obtain the feedback. To improve the precision of
this feedback, a novel reference alignment process is proposed that aims to
remove hypothesised edits that results from fluent transcription errors.
Finally, these approaches are combined with an edit confidence estimation
approach, to exclude low-confidence edits. Experiments on the in-house
Linguaskill (LNG) corpora and the publicly available Speak & Improve (S&I)
corpus show that the proposed approaches significantly boost E2E SGEC
performance.

Motivation: 探索微调预训练模型在特定任务中性能下降的原因，挑战传统迁移学习的有效性。

Method: 通过五种模型变体（包括全参数微调和参数高效的LoRA适配）进行实验，分析嵌入空间结构和训练动态。

Result: 微调破坏了基础模型在预训练中学习到的最优嵌入空间结构，导致性能下降。

Conclusion: 结果表明，传统迁移学习方法在饱和基准测试中可能无效，需要架构创新以实现改进。

Abstract: This paper investigates the counterintuitive phenomenon where fine-tuning
pre-trained transformer models degrades performance on the MS MARCO passage
ranking task. Through comprehensive experiments involving five model
variants-including full parameter fine-tuning and parameter efficient LoRA
adaptations-we demonstrate that all fine-tuning approaches underperform the
base sentence-transformers/all- MiniLM-L6-v2 model (MRR@10: 0.3026). Our
analysis reveals that fine-tuning disrupts the optimal embedding space
structure learned during the base model's extensive pre-training on 1 billion
sentence pairs, including 9.1 million MS MARCO samples. UMAP visualizations
show progressive embedding space flattening, while training dynamics analysis
and computational efficiency metrics further support our findings. These
results challenge conventional wisdom about transfer learning effectiveness on
saturated benchmarks and suggest architectural innovations may be necessary for
meaningful improvements.

Motivation: 仇恨言论检测是NLP应用中的重要任务，但定义模糊影响了模型性能。研究旨在明确仇恨言论的定义及其对模型的影响。

Method: 收集并分析现有仇恨言论定义，构建14个概念元素的分类法；在三种数据集上对三种LLM进行零样本评估。

Result: 不同定义（即不同具体程度的概念元素）对模型性能有影响，但这种影响因模型架构而异。

Conclusion: 仇恨言论定义的具体性会影响模型性能，但需考虑模型架构的差异。

Abstract: Detecting harmful content is a crucial task in the landscape of NLP
applications for Social Good, with hate speech being one of its most dangerous
forms. But what do we mean by hate speech, how can we define it, and how does
prompting different definitions of hate speech affect model performance? The
contribution of this work is twofold. At the theoretical level, we address the
ambiguity surrounding hate speech by collecting and analyzing existing
definitions from the literature. We organize these definitions into a taxonomy
of 14 Conceptual Elements-building blocks that capture different aspects of
hate speech definitions, such as references to the target of hate (individual
or groups) or of the potential consequences of it. At the experimental level,
we employ the collection of definitions in a systematic zero-shot evaluation of
three LLMs, on three hate speech datasets representing different types of data
(synthetic, human-in-the-loop, and real-world). We find that choosing different
definitions, i.e., definitions with a different degree of specificity in terms
of encoded elements, impacts model performance, but this effect is not
consistent across all architectures.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种并行连续思维链（PCCoT）方法，通过并行更新潜在思维令牌，显著提升了训练和推理效率，同时保持了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 连续思维链（CoT）虽然能有效节省推理令牌，但其顺序依赖性导致训练时间长，影响了效率。

Method: 采用Jacobi迭代法并行更新潜在思维令牌，替代原有的顺序更新方式。

Result: 实验表明，PCCoT在保持性能的同时，节省了近50%的训练和推理时间，且训练过程更稳定。

Conclusion: PCCoT通过并行化显著提升了连续思维链的效率，同时保持了其性能优势。

Abstract: Continuous chain-of-thought has been shown to be effective in saving
reasoning tokens for large language models. By reasoning with continuous latent
thought tokens, continuous CoT is able to perform implicit reasoning in a
compact manner. However, the sequential dependencies between latent thought
tokens spoil parallel training, leading to long training time. In this paper,
we propose Parallel Continuous Chain-of-Thought (PCCoT), which performs Jacobi
iteration on the latent thought tokens, updating them iteratively in parallel
instead of sequentially and thus improving both training and inference
efficiency of continuous CoT. Experiments demonstrate that by choosing the
proper number of iterations, we are able to achieve comparable or even better
performance while saving nearly 50% of the training and inference time.
Moreover, PCCoT shows better stability and robustness in the training process.

TL;DR: 论文讨论了大型语言模型（LLM）模拟中数据污染的潜在问题，但指出这并不妨碍研究LLM群体中真正涌现的动态行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 澄清数据污染问题对LLM群体动态研究的限制，并强调涌现行为的可研究性。

Method: 通过分析Barrie和Törnberg对Flint Ashery等人研究的批评，探讨LLM群体中自组织和模型依赖的涌现动态。

Result: 实证研究表明，LLM群体中存在社会规范等涌现动态。

Conclusion: 数据污染虽重要，但不妨碍研究LLM群体中的涌现行为，社会规范等动态已被实证观察。

Abstract: A potential concern when simulating populations of large language models
(LLMs) is data contamination, i.e. the possibility that training data may shape
outcomes in unintended ways. While this concern is important and may hinder
certain experiments with multi-agent models, it does not preclude the study of
genuinely emergent dynamics in LLM populations. The recent critique by Barrie
and T\"ornberg [1] of the results of Flint Ashery et al. [2] offers an
opportunity to clarify that self-organisation and model-dependent emergent
dynamics can be studied in LLM populations, highlighting how such dynamics have
been empirically observed in the specific case of social conventions.

*R. Prashanth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了语义相似性估计问题，比较了USE、InferSent和BERT等先进技术，发现BERT在特定领域数据集上表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语义相似性估计在自然语言处理和理解中有广泛应用，如问答、语义搜索等。研究旨在比较不同技术的性能。

Method: 使用USE、InferSent和BERT模型，分别在特定领域内部数据集和公开的Quora问题对数据集上进行实验。

Result: BERT模型表现最优，归因于其微调过程能够学习训练数据的模式。

Conclusion: BERT是处理特定领域数据的最佳选择。

Abstract: Estimation of semantic similarity is an important research problem both in
natural language processing and the natural language understanding, and that
has tremendous application on various downstream tasks such as question
answering, semantic search, information retrieval, document clustering,
word-sense disambiguation and machine translation. In this work, we carry out
the estimation of semantic similarity using different state-of-the-art
techniques including the USE (Universal Sentence Encoder), InferSent and the
most recent BERT, or Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers,
models. We use two question pairs datasets for the analysis, one is a domain
specific in-house dataset and the other is a public dataset which is the
Quora's question pairs dataset. We observe that the BERT model gave much
superior performance as compared to the other methods. This should be because
of the fine-tuning procedure that is involved in its training process, allowing
it to learn patterns based on the training data that is used. This works
demonstrates the applicability of BERT on domain specific datasets. We infer
from the analysis that BERT is the best technique to use in the case of domain
specific data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在公共演讲说服力理解上的表现。

Method: 使用3MT法语数据集，通过GPT-4o修改演讲文本，分析修辞和话语标记的变化。

Result: GPT-4o通过情感词汇和句法结构调整增强修辞效果，但缺乏人类式说服力优化。

Conclusion: GPT-4o在说服力生成上更注重风格而非内容优化。

Abstract: This study examines how large language models understand the concept of
persuasiveness in public speaking by modifying speech transcripts from PhD
candidates in the "Ma These en 180 Secondes" competition, using the 3MT French
dataset. Our contributions include a novel methodology and an interpretable
textual feature set integrating rhetorical devices and discourse markers. We
prompt GPT-4o to enhance or diminish persuasiveness and analyze linguistic
shifts between original and generated speech in terms of the new features.
Results indicate that GPT-4o applies systematic stylistic modifications rather
than optimizing persuasiveness in a human-like manner. Notably, it manipulates
emotional lexicon and syntactic structures (such as interrogative and
exclamatory clauses) to amplify rhetorical impact.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ByteSpan是一种基于信息驱动的新型子词分词器，通过外部字节级语言模型训练，将可预测的字节序列分组为子词，实验显示其在英语和多语言任务中表现优于BPE。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索是否可以通过将可预测的字节分组而非仅池化其表示，来生成有用的固定子词词汇表。

Method: 提出ByteSpan，利用外部字节级语言模型在训练中识别连续可预测的字节序列并将其分组为子词。

Result: ByteSpan生成的词汇表在英语中形态对齐分数高于BPE，同时在25种语言中表现出相似的压缩和Rényi效率。

Conclusion: ByteSpan是一种高效且多语言适用的子词分词方法。

Abstract: Recent dynamic tokenisation methods operate directly on bytes and pool their
latent representations into patches. This bears similarities to computational
models of word segmentation that determine lexical boundaries using spikes in
an autoregressive model's prediction error. Inspired by this connection, we
explore whether grouping predictable bytes - rather than pooling their
representations - can yield a useful fixed subword vocabulary. We propose a new
information-driven subword tokeniser, ByteSpan, that uses an external
byte-level LM during training to identify contiguous predictable byte sequences
and group them into subwords. Experiments show that ByteSpan yields efficient
vocabularies with higher morphological alignment scores than BPE for English.
Multilingual experiments show similar compression and R\'enyi efficiency for 25
languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的计算和能源成本因模型规模扩大和用户数量激增而急剧上升。分词器在模型效率中起关键作用，但现有分词器主要针对训练语料库优化，而非聊天对话场景。

Method: 使用公开的聊天机器人对话语料库重新设计分词器词汇表，并评估其在对话领域中的性能。

Result: 优化后的分词器在聊天对话中减少了令牌数量，实现了5%到10%的能源节省，同时对原始训练语料库的分词效率影响极小甚至略有提升。

Conclusion: 为聊天机器人对话优化分词器具有实际效益，能显著降低能源消耗，同时保持或略微提升原有性能。

Abstract: The computational and energy costs of Large Language Models (LLMs) have
increased exponentially driven by the growing model sizes and the massive
adoption of LLMs by hundreds of millions of users. The unit cost of an LLM is
the computation of a token. Therefore, the tokenizer plays an important role in
the efficiency of a model, and they are carefully optimized to minimize the
number of tokens for the text in their training corpus. One of the most popular
applications of LLMs are chatbots that interact with users. A key observation
is that, for those chatbots, what is important is the performance of the
tokenizer in the user text input and the chatbot responses. Those are most
likely different from the text in the training corpus. So, a question that
immediately arises is whether there is a potential benefit in optimizing
tokenizers for chatbot conversations. In this paper, this idea is explored for
different tokenizers by using a publicly available corpus of chatbot
conversations to redesign their vocabularies and evaluate their performance in
this domain. The results show that conversation-optimized tokenizers
consistently reduce the number of tokens in chatbot dialogues, which can lead
to meaningful energy savings, in the range of 5% to 10% while having minimal or
even slightly positive impact on tokenization efficiency for the original
training corpus.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有序列到序列系统在识别未训练词汇（如专有名词、缩写等）时的不足，尤其是发音与拼写不匹配的情况。

Method: 允许用户在推理过程中动态添加修正，以纠正替换错误。

Result: 在偏置词错误率上相对提升高达11%，同时保持整体词错误率的竞争力。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了语音识别系统对未训练词汇的识别能力，尤其是发音与拼写不匹配的词汇。

Abstract: Neural sequence-to-sequence systems deliver state-of-the-art performance for
automatic speech recognition. When using appropriate modeling units, e.g.,
byte-pair encoded characters, these systems are in principal open vocabulary
systems. In practice, however, they often fail to recognize words not seen
during training, e.g., named entities, acronyms, or domain-specific special
words. To address this problem, many context biasing methods have been
proposed; however, for words with a pronunciation-orthography mismatch, these
methods may still struggle. We propose a method which allows corrections of
substitution errors to improve the recognition accuracy of such challenging
words. Users can add corrections on the fly during inference. We show that with
this method we get a relative improvement in biased word error rate of up to
11\%, while maintaining a competitive overall word error rate.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注内容知识，缺乏对教学法理解的评估，填补这一空白对教育领域的AI应用至关重要。

Method: 基于教师专业发展考试的精心筛选问题集，涵盖教学策略和评估方法等子领域，开发了新的基准。

Result: 测试了97个模型，准确率在28%至89%之间，分析了成本与准确率的关系，并提供了在线排行榜。

Conclusion: 教育相关基准对衡量模型教学理解能力、支持教育实践及指导政策决策至关重要。

Abstract: Benchmarks like Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) have played a
pivotal role in evaluating AI's knowledge and abilities across diverse domains.
However, existing benchmarks predominantly focus on content knowledge, leaving
a critical gap in assessing models' understanding of pedagogy - the method and
practice of teaching. This paper introduces The Pedagogy Benchmark, a novel
dataset designed to evaluate large language models on their Cross-Domain
Pedagogical Knowledge (CDPK) and Special Education Needs and Disability (SEND)
pedagogical knowledge. These benchmarks are built on a carefully curated set of
questions sourced from professional development exams for teachers, which cover
a range of pedagogical subdomains such as teaching strategies and assessment
methods. Here we outline the methodology and development of these benchmarks.
We report results for 97 models, with accuracies spanning a range from 28% to
89% on the pedagogical knowledge questions. We consider the relationship
between cost and accuracy and chart the progression of the Pareto value
frontier over time. We provide online leaderboards at
https://rebrand.ly/pedagogy which are updated with new models and allow
interactive exploration and filtering based on various model properties, such
as cost per token and open-vs-closed weights, as well as looking at performance
in different subjects. LLMs and generative AI have tremendous potential to
influence education and help to address the global learning crisis.
Education-focused benchmarks are crucial to measure models' capacities to
understand pedagogical concepts, respond appropriately to learners' needs, and
support effective teaching practices across diverse contexts. They are needed
for informing the responsible and evidence-based deployment of LLMs and
LLM-based tools in educational settings, and for guiding both development and
policy decisions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在图形用户界面（GUIs）中依赖自动提示工程优化用户输入，但用户需求的多样性常导致误解和错误输出。

Method: 提出AGBS方法，模拟常见提示优化机制并保持语义稳定性，动态评估策略对LLM性能的影响，生成鲁棒对抗样本。

Result: 在开源和闭源LLMs上的实验表明，AGBS能有效平衡语义一致性和攻击效果。

Conclusion: 研究结果为设计更可靠的提示优化系统提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on automatic prompt
engineering in graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to refine user inputs and
enhance response accuracy. However, the diversity of user requirements often
leads to unintended misinterpretations, where automated optimizations distort
original intentions and produce erroneous outputs. To address this challenge,
we propose the Adaptive Greedy Binary Search (AGBS) method, which simulates
common prompt optimization mechanisms while preserving semantic stability. Our
approach dynamically evaluates the impact of such strategies on LLM
performance, enabling robust adversarial sample generation. Through extensive
experiments on open and closed-source LLMs, we demonstrate AGBS's effectiveness
in balancing semantic consistency and attack efficacy. Our findings offer
actionable insights for designing more reliable prompt optimization systems.

Result: 实验表明框架有效，提高了判决的客观性、公平性和合理性。

Conclusion: ASP2LJ框架和RareCases数据集为自动化司法系统研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: Legal Judgment Prediction (LJP) aims to predict judicial outcomes, including
relevant legal charge, terms, and fines, which is a crucial process in Large
Language Model(LLM). However, LJP faces two key challenges: (1)Long Tail
Distribution: Current datasets, derived from authentic cases, suffer from high
human annotation costs and imbalanced distributions, leading to model
performance degradation. (2)Lawyer's Improvement: Existing systems focus on
enhancing judges' decision-making but neglect the critical role of lawyers in
refining arguments, which limits overall judicial accuracy. To address these
issues, we propose an Adversarial Self-Play Lawyer Augmented Legal Judgment
Framework, called ASP2LJ, which integrates a case generation module to tackle
long-tailed data distributions and an adversarial self-play mechanism to
enhance lawyers' argumentation skills. Our framework enables a judge to
reference evolved lawyers' arguments, improving the objectivity, fairness, and
rationality of judicial decisions. Besides, We also introduce RareCases, a
dataset for rare legal cases in China, which contains 120 tail-end cases. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the SimuCourt dataset and our
RareCases dataset. Experimental results show our framework brings improvements,
indicating its utilization. Our contributions include an integrated framework,
a rare-case dataset, and publicly releasing datasets and code to support
further research in automated judicial systems.

Motivation: 确保大型语言模型的决策透明可信，需解决其内部推理的自相矛盾问题。

Method: 引入不一致性度量指标，并提出基于图和基于能量的两种自动化方法。

Result: 即使先进模型如DeepSeek-R1和GPT-o4-mini也未完全自一致，改进方法仅部分有效。

Conclusion: 自一致性对构建可靠、可解释AI至关重要，但完全解决仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have grown increasingly powerful, yet ensuring
their decisions remain transparent and trustworthy requires self-consistency --
no contradictions in their internal reasoning. Our study reveals that even on
simple tasks, such as comparing points on a line or a plane, or reasoning in a
family tree, all smaller models are highly inconsistent, and even
state-of-the-art models like DeepSeek-R1 and GPT-o4-mini are not fully
self-consistent. To quantify and mitigate these inconsistencies, we introduce
inconsistency metrics and propose two automated methods -- a graph-based and an
energy-based approach. While these fixes provide partial improvements, they
also highlight the complexity and importance of self-consistency in building
more reliable and interpretable AI. The code and data are available at

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively evaluated for general
summarization tasks as well as medical research assistance, but they have not
been specifically evaluated for the task of summarizing real-world evidence
(RWE) from structured output of RWE studies. We introduce RWESummary, a
proposed addition to the MedHELM framework (Bedi, Cui, Fuentes, Unell et al.,
2025) to enable benchmarking of LLMs for this task. RWESummary includes one
scenario and three evaluations covering major types of errors observed in
summarization of medical research studies and was developed using Atropos
Health proprietary data. Additionally, we use RWESummary to compare the
performance of different LLMs in our internal RWE summarization tool. At the
time of publication, with 13 distinct RWE studies, we found the Gemini 2.5
models performed best overall (both Flash and Pro). We suggest RWESummary as a
novel and useful foundation model benchmark for real-world evidence study
summarization.

Motivation: 解决长语音实时翻译的独特挑战，避免从头训练端到端模型。

Method: 使用Whisper Large-V3-Turbo进行语音识别，NLLB-3.3B进行机器翻译，结合前缀训练和自适应发射策略（如wait-$k$和RALCP）。

Result: 在ACL60/60数据集上BLEU得分为31.96，延迟2.94秒；IWSLT25Instruct测试集得分为29.8 BLEU。

Conclusion: 预训练模型经轻量级适应可有效实现长内容实时翻译，无需大量领域数据或端到端训练。

Abstract: This work describes the participation of the MLLP-VRAIN research group in the
shared task of the IWSLT 2025 Simultaneous Speech Translation track. Our
submission addresses the unique challenges of real-time translation of
long-form speech by developing a modular cascade system that adapts strong
pre-trained models to streaming scenarios. We combine Whisper Large-V3-Turbo
for ASR with the multilingual NLLB-3.3B model for MT, implementing lightweight
adaptation techniques rather than training new end-to-end models from scratch.
Our approach employs document-level adaptation with prefix training to enhance
the MT model's ability to handle incomplete inputs, while incorporating
adaptive emission policies including a wait-$k$ strategy and RALCP for managing
the translation stream. Specialized buffer management techniques and
segmentation strategies ensure coherent translations across long audio
sequences. Experimental results on the ACL60/60 dataset demonstrate that our
system achieves a favorable balance between translation quality and latency,
with a BLEU score of 31.96 and non-computational-aware StreamLAAL latency of
2.94 seconds. Our final model achieves a preliminary score on the official test
set (IWSLT25Instruct) of 29.8 BLEU. Our work demonstrates that carefully
adapted pre-trained components can create effective simultaneous translation
systems for long-form content without requiring extensive in-domain parallel
data or specialized end-to-end training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在长链推理中因过度思考导致的冗余计算和性能下降问题。

Method: 结合块级分类器和PID控制器，动态调整推理强度。

Result: 在GSM8K上准确率提升6%，令牌使用减少32%。

Conclusion: STUPID为动态推理校准提供了高效框架，兼顾性能与计算效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models employing extended chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
often suffer from the overthinking phenomenon, generating excessive and
redundant reasoning steps that increase computational costs while potentially
degrading performance. While recent work has explored static steering
approaches to mitigate this issue, they lack the adaptability to dynamically
adjust intervention strength based on real-time reasoning quality. We propose
STUPID (Steering Token Usage via PID controller), a novel training-free method
that employs a PID controller to dynamically modulate activation steering
strength during inference. Our approach combines a chunk-level classifier for
detecting redundant reasoning patterns with a PID control mechanism that
adaptively adjusts steering intensity based on the predicted redundancy
probability. Experimental evaluation on GSM8K demonstrates that STUPID achieves
a 6% improvement in accuracy while reducing token usage by 32%, outperforming
static steering baselines. Our method provides a principled framework for
dynamic reasoning calibration that maintains reasoning quality while
significantly improving computational efficiency.

Conclusion: 激励方法有效提升了LLM的超长文本生成能力，成果开源。

Abstract: Ultra-long generation by large language models (LLMs) is a widely demanded
scenario, yet it remains a significant challenge due to their maximum
generation length limit and overall quality degradation as sequence length
increases. Previous approaches, exemplified by LongWriter, typically rely on
''teaching'', which involves supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on synthetic
long-form outputs. However, this strategy heavily depends on synthetic SFT
data, which is difficult and costly to construct, often lacks coherence and
consistency, and tends to be overly artificial and structurally monotonous. In
this work, we propose an incentivization-based approach that, starting entirely
from scratch and without relying on any annotated or synthetic data, leverages
reinforcement learning (RL) to foster the emergence of ultra-long, high-quality
text generation capabilities in LLMs. We perform RL training starting from a
base model, similar to R1-Zero, guiding it to engage in reasoning that
facilitates planning and refinement during the writing process. To support
this, we employ specialized reward models that steer the LLM towards improved
length control, writing quality, and structural formatting. Experimental
evaluations show that our LongWriter-Zero model, trained from Qwen2.5-32B,
consistently outperforms traditional SFT methods on long-form writing tasks,
achieving state-of-the-art results across all metrics on WritingBench and
Arena-Write, and even surpassing 100B+ models such as DeepSeek R1 and
Qwen3-235B. We open-source our data and model checkpoints under

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability (MI) aims to explain how neural networks work by
uncovering their underlying causal mechanisms. As the field grows in influence,
it is increasingly important to examine not just models themselves, but the

argue that mechanistic interpretability needs philosophy: not as an

its methods, and assessing the epistemic and ethical stakes of interpreting AI
systems. Taking three open problems from the MI literature as examples, this
position paper illustrates the value philosophy can add to MI research, and

Conclusion: CommVQ方法高效减少了KV缓存内存占用，支持长上下文LLM推理在单GPU上运行。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in applications requiring
long context lengths, but the key-value (KV) cache often becomes a memory
bottleneck on GPUs as context grows. To address this, we propose Commutative
Vector Quantization (CommVQ) to significantly reduce memory usage for
long-context LLM inference. We first introduce additive quantization with a
lightweight encoder and codebook to compress the KV cache, which can be decoded
via simple matrix multiplication. To further reduce computational costs during
decoding, we design the codebook to be commutative with Rotary Position
Embedding (RoPE) and train it using an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.
This enables efficient integration of decoding into the self-attention
mechanism. Our approach achieves high accuracy with additive quantization and
low overhead via the RoPE-commutative codebook. Experiments on long-context
benchmarks and GSM8K show that our method reduces FP16 KV cache size by 87.5%
with 2-bit quantization, while outperforming state-of-the-art KV cache
quantization methods. Notably, it enables 1-bit KV cache quantization with
minimal accuracy loss, allowing a LLaMA-3.1 8B model to run with a 128K context
length on a single RTX 4090 GPU. The source code is available at:

TL;DR: OMEGA是一个新的数学问题评估基准，旨在测试大语言模型在三种不同泛化能力上的表现，发现模型在复杂问题上的表现显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型在数学问题上的局限性，特别是其在需要新颖思维方式的问题上的表现不足。

Method: 引入OMEGA基准，通过程序化生成的问题对模型在探索性、组合性和转化性三种泛化能力上进行评估。

Result: 前沿大语言模型在问题复杂性增加时表现显著下降；Qwen系列模型在探索性泛化上有改进，但在组合性和转化性泛化上表现有限。

Conclusion: OMEGA为提升大语言模型在数学创造力方面的研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent large-scale language models (LLMs) with long Chain-of-Thought
reasoning-such as DeepSeek-R1-have achieved impressive results on
Olympiad-level mathematics benchmarks. However, they often rely on a narrow set
of strategies and struggle with problems that require a novel way of thinking.
To systematically investigate these limitations, we introduce
OMEGA-Out-of-distribution Math Problems Evaluation with 3 Generalization Axes-a
controlled yet diverse benchmark designed to evaluate three axes of
out-of-distribution generalization, inspired by Boden's typology of creativity:
(1) Exploratory-applying known problem solving skills to more complex instances
within the same problem domain; (2) Compositional-combining distinct reasoning
skills, previously learned in isolation, to solve novel problems that require
integrating these skills in new and coherent ways; and (3)
Transformative-adopting novel, often unconventional strategies by moving beyond
familiar approaches to solve problems more effectively. OMEGA consists of
programmatically generated training-test pairs derived from templated problem
generators across geometry, number theory, algebra, combinatorics, logic, and
puzzles, with solutions verified using symbolic, numerical, or graphical
methods. We evaluate frontier (or top-tier) LLMs and observe sharp performance
degradation as problem complexity increases. Moreover, we fine-tune the
Qwen-series models across all generalization settings and observe notable
improvements in exploratory generalization, while compositional generalization
remains limited and transformative reasoning shows little to no improvement. By
isolating and quantifying these fine-grained failures, OMEGA lays the
groundwork for advancing LLMs toward genuine mathematical creativity beyond
mechanical proficiency.

TL;DR: ReasonFlux-PRM是一种新型的轨迹感知过程奖励模型，旨在评估轨迹-响应类型的推理过程，并在多个任务中表现优于现有PRM和人工基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PRM主要基于模型最终输出训练，难以稳健评估中间推理轨迹，尤其是在前沿推理模型生成的轨迹-响应输出中。

Method: ReasonFlux-PRM结合了步骤级和轨迹级监督，支持离线和在线奖励监督，包括数据选择、强化学习和测试时扩展。

Result: 在AIME、MATH500和GPQA-Diamond等基准测试中，ReasonFlux-PRM-7B表现优于Qwen2.5-Math-PRM-72B和人工基准，平均提升12.1%（监督微调）、4.5%（强化学习）和6.3%（测试时扩展）。

Conclusion: ReasonFlux-PRM在评估推理轨迹和提升模型性能方面具有显著优势，并提供了适用于资源受限场景的高效版本。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have recently emerged as a powerful framework
for supervising intermediate reasoning steps in large language models (LLMs).
Previous PRMs are primarily trained on model final output responses and
struggle to evaluate intermediate thinking trajectories robustly, especially in
the emerging setting of trajectory-response outputs generated by frontier
reasoning models like Deepseek-R1. In this work, we introduce ReasonFlux-PRM, a
novel trajectory-aware PRM explicitly designed to evaluate the
trajectory-response type of reasoning traces. ReasonFlux-PRM incorporates both
step-level and trajectory-level supervision, enabling fine-grained reward
assignment aligned with structured chain-of-thought data. We adapt
ReasonFlux-PRM to support reward supervision under both offline and online
settings, including (i) selecting high-quality model distillation data for
downstream supervised fine-tuning of smaller models, (ii) providing dense
process-level rewards for policy optimization during reinforcement learning,
and (iii) enabling reward-guided Best-of-N test-time scaling. Empirical results
on challenging downstream benchmarks such as AIME, MATH500, and GPQA-Diamond
demonstrate that ReasonFlux-PRM-7B selects higher quality data than strong PRMs
(e.g., Qwen2.5-Math-PRM-72B) and human-curated baselines. Furthermore, our
derived ReasonFlux-PRM-7B yields consistent performance improvements, achieving
average gains of 12.1% in supervised fine-tuning, 4.5% in reinforcement
learning, and 6.3% in test-time scaling. We also release our efficient
ReasonFlux-PRM-1.5B for resource-constrained applications and edge deployment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨提示和微调在低资源设置和分布偏移下的鲁棒性差异，为模型选择提供指导。

Method: 通过比较不同任务格式、提示风格和模型规模下的表现，分析内部表示以评估特征稳定性。

Result: 发现两种策略在知识内化和泛化方式上存在显著差异，提示在参数效率和灵活性上更优。

Conclusion: 为低数据场景下的模型选择提供实用建议，并丰富了提示与微调对比的实证研究。

Abstract: We investigate the generalization capabilities of small language models under
two popular adaptation paradigms: few-shot prompting and supervised
fine-tuning. While prompting is often favored for its parameter efficiency and
flexibility, it remains unclear how robust this approach is in low-resource
settings and under distributional shifts. This paper presents a comparative
study of prompting and fine-tuning across task formats, prompt styles, and
model scales, with a focus on their behavior in both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution (OOD) settings.
  Beyond accuracy, we analyze the internal representations learned by each
approach to assess the stability and abstraction of task-specific features. Our
findings highlight critical differences in how small models internalize and
generalize knowledge under different adaptation strategies. This work offers
practical guidance for model selection in low-data regimes and contributes
empirical insight into the ongoing debate over prompting versus fine-tuning.

### [272] [Individual Causal Inference with Structural Causal Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17300)
*Daniel T. Chang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于结构因果模型（SCM）的个体因果推断（ICI）方法，通过个体化操作符（indiv(W)）和个体因果查询（P(Y | indiv(W), do(X), Z)）来估计个体因果效应（ICE）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统因果推断方法基于群体，难以直接应用于个体。本文旨在利用SCM中的外生变量（U）捕捉个体差异，实现个体化的因果推断。

Method: 提出indiv(W)操作符和个体因果查询P(Y | indiv(W), do(X), Z)，将SCM个体化，以估计ICE。

Result: 论证了ICI是基于个体可能性的推断，而非反事实推断。

Conclusion: SCM为个体因果推断提供了理论框架，扩展了因果推断的应用范围。

Abstract: Individual causal inference (ICI) uses causal inference methods to understand
and predict the effects of interventions on individuals, considering their
specific characteristics / facts. It aims to estimate individual causal effect
(ICE), which varies across individuals. Estimating ICE can be challenging due
to the limited data available for individuals, and the fact that most causal
inference methods are population-based. Structural Causal Model (SCM) is
fundamentally population-based. Therefore, causal discovery (structural
learning and parameter learning), association queries and intervention queries
are all naturally population-based. However, exogenous variables (U) in SCM can
encode individual variations and thus provide the mechanism for individualized
population per specific individual characteristics / facts. Based on this, we
propose ICI with SCM as a "rung 3" causal inference, because it involves
"imagining" what would be the causal effect of a hypothetical intervention on
an individual, given the individual's observed characteristics / facts.
Specifically, we propose the indiv-operator, indiv(W), to formalize/represent
the population individualization process, and the individual causal query, P(Y
| indiv(W), do(X), Z), to formalize/represent ICI. We show and argue that ICI
with SCM is inference on individual alternatives (possible), not individual
counterfactuals (non-actual).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI系统需要在目标与价值观不同的多方环境中做出决策，传统契约主义方法达成协议成本高且耗时。

Method: 采用资源理性契约主义（RRC），结合规范性启发式方法，动态适应人类社会的复杂性。

Result: RRC框架使AI系统能够高效运作，并动态适应和理解不断变化的人类社会环境。

Conclusion: RRC为AI在复杂人类环境中的决策提供了一种高效且适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: AI systems will soon have to navigate human environments and make decisions
that affect people and other AI agents whose goals and values diverge.
Contractualist alignment proposes grounding those decisions in agreements that
diverse stakeholders would endorse under the right conditions, yet securing
such agreement at scale remains costly and slow -- even for advanced AI. We
therefore propose Resource-Rational Contractualism (RRC): a framework where AI
systems approximate the agreements rational parties would form by drawing on a
toolbox of normatively-grounded, cognitively-inspired heuristics that trade
effort for accuracy. An RRC-aligned agent would not only operate efficiently,
but also be equipped to dynamically adapt to and interpret the ever-changing
human social world.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly integrated into modern
healthcare, offering powerful support for clinical decision-making. However, in
real-world settings, AI systems may experience performance degradation over
time, due to factors such as shifting data distributions, changes in patient
characteristics, evolving clinical protocols, and variations in data quality.
These factors can compromise model reliability, posing safety concerns and
increasing the likelihood of inaccurate predictions or adverse outcomes. This
review presents a forward-looking perspective on monitoring and maintaining the
"health" of AI systems in healthcare. We highlight the urgent need for
continuous performance monitoring, early degradation detection, and effective
self-correction mechanisms. The paper begins by reviewing common causes of
performance degradation at both data and model levels. We then summarize key
techniques for detecting data and model drift, followed by an in-depth look at
root cause analysis. Correction strategies are further reviewed, ranging from
model retraining to test-time adaptation. Our survey spans both traditional
machine learning models and state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs),
offering insights into their strengths and limitations. Finally, we discuss
ongoing technical challenges and propose future research directions. This work
aims to guide the development of reliable, robust medical AI systems capable of
sustaining safe, long-term deployment in dynamic clinical settings.

TL;DR: OmniReflect是一个分层、反思驱动的框架，通过构建指导原则（constitution）提升LLM代理的性能，在动态环境中表现出高效性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM代理在复杂任务中的性能提升方法（如微调和自我修正）缺乏长期学习机制，且在动态环境中效率低下。

Method: OmniReflect采用两种模式：自我维持（单个代理定期反思）和协作（Meta-advisor从校准集中提取指导原则）。结合神经、符号和神经符号技术构建原则。

Result: 实验结果显示，OmniReflect在多个任务中显著提升性能（如ALFWorld +10.3%，BabyAI +23.8%），且轻量级代理在协作模式下优于基线。

Conclusion: OmniReflect在多样环境和模型上表现出鲁棒性和高效性，为LLM代理的长期学习和动态适应提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Efforts to improve Large Language Model (LLM) agent performance on complex
tasks have largely focused on fine-tuning and iterative self-correction.
However, these approaches often lack generalizable mechanisms for longterm
learning and remain inefficient in dynamic environments. We introduce
OmniReflect, a hierarchical, reflection-driven framework that constructs a
constitution, a compact set of guiding principles distilled from task
experiences, to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of an LLM agent.
OmniReflect operates in two modes: Self-sustaining, where a single agent
periodically curates its own reflections during task execution, and
Co-operative, where a Meta-advisor derives a constitution from a small
calibration set to guide another agent. To construct these constitutional
principles, we employ Neural, Symbolic, and NeuroSymbolic techniques, offering
a balance between contextual adaptability and computational efficiency.
Empirical results averaged across models show major improvements in task
success, with absolute gains of +10.3% on ALFWorld, +23.8% on BabyAI, and +8.3%
on PDDL in the Self-sustaining mode. Similar gains are seen in the Co-operative
mode, where a lightweight Qwen3-4B ReAct agent outperforms all Reflexion
baselines on BabyAI. These findings highlight the robustness and effectiveness
of OmniReflect across environments and backbones.

Motivation: 供应链操作中大量关键知识隐藏在非结构化通信中，传统RAG系统因数据质量差而效果有限。

Method: 采用多智能体系统（分类发现、分类、知识合成）离线处理支持票证，生成结构化知识库。

Result: 知识库体积减少至原始数据的3.4%，RAG系统性能提升（48.74% vs. 38.60%有效回答），减少77.4%无效响应。

Conclusion: 该方法通过离线处理将非结构化通信转化为可重用知识，显著提升供应链支持效率，实现50%未来票证自动解决。

Abstract: Supply chain operations generate vast amounts of operational data; however,
critical knowledge such as system usage practices, troubleshooting workflows,
and resolution techniques often remains buried within unstructured
communications like support tickets, emails, and chat logs. While RAG systems
aim to leverage such communications as a knowledge base, their effectiveness is
limited by raw data challenges: support tickets are typically noisy,
inconsistent, and incomplete, making direct retrieval suboptimal. Unlike
existing RAG approaches that focus on runtime optimization, we introduce a
novel offline-first methodology that transforms these communications into a
structured knowledge base. Our key innovation is a LLMs-based multi-agent
system orchestrating three specialized agents: Category Discovery for taxonomy
creation, Categorization for ticket grouping, and Knowledge Synthesis for
article generation. Applying our methodology to real-world support tickets with
resolution notes and comments, our system creates a compact knowledge base -
reducing total volume to just 3.4% of original ticket data while improving
quality. Experiments demonstrate that our prebuilt knowledge base in RAG
systems significantly outperforms traditional RAG implementations (48.74% vs.
38.60% helpful answers) and achieves a 77.4% reduction in unhelpful responses.
By automating institutional knowledge capture that typically remains siloed in
experts' heads, our solution translates to substantial operational efficiency:
reducing support workload, accelerating resolution times, and creating
self-improving systems that automatically resolve approximately 50% of future
supply chain tickets. Our approach addresses a key gap in knowledge management
by transforming transient communications into structured, reusable knowledge
through intelligent offline processing rather than latency-inducing runtime
architectures.

Conclusion: 万花筒式团队框架为AI代理的安全性评估提供了更全面的方法，尤其在复杂交互和多代理场景中。

Abstract: Warning: This paper contains content that may be inappropriate or offensive.
  AI agents have gained significant recent attention due to their autonomous
tool usage capabilities and their integration in various real-world
applications. This autonomy poses novel challenges for the safety of such
systems, both in single- and multi-agent scenarios. We argue that existing red
teaming or safety evaluation frameworks fall short in evaluating safety risks
in complex behaviors, thought processes and actions taken by agents. Moreover,
they fail to consider risks in multi-agent setups where various vulnerabilities
can be exposed when agents engage in complex behaviors and interactions with
each other. To address this shortcoming, we introduce the term kaleidoscopic
teaming which seeks to capture complex and wide range of vulnerabilities that
can happen in agents both in single-agent and multi-agent scenarios. We also
present a new kaleidoscopic teaming framework that generates a diverse array of
scenarios modeling real-world human societies. Our framework evaluates safety
of agents in both single-agent and multi-agent setups. In single-agent setup,
an agent is given a scenario that it needs to complete using the tools it has
access to. In multi-agent setup, multiple agents either compete against or
cooperate together to complete a task in the scenario through which we capture
existing safety vulnerabilities in agents. We introduce new in-context
optimization techniques that can be used in our kaleidoscopic teaming framework
to generate better scenarios for safety analysis. Lastly, we present
appropriate metrics that can be used along with our framework to measure safety
of agents. Utilizing our kaleidoscopic teaming framework, we identify
vulnerabilities in various models with respect to their safety in agentic
use-cases.

Motivation: 当前语言模型的引用不可靠，且依赖外部检索器引入延迟和噪声，研究旨在通过训练改进实现可靠引用。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：持续预训练绑定事实与文档标识符，指令微调引导引用行为；提出Active Indexing方法，通过合成QA对增强训练。

Result: Active Indexing在Qwen2.5-7B和3B上表现优于Passive Indexing，引用精度提升最高达30.2%。

Conclusion: Active Indexing方法有效提升语言模型的引用可靠性，且性能随数据增强规模持续提升。

Abstract: Trustworthy language models should provide both correct and verifiable
answers. While language models can sometimes attribute their outputs to
pretraining data, their citations are often unreliable due to hallucination. As
a result, current systems insert citations by querying an external retriever at
inference time, introducing latency, infrastructure dependence, and
vulnerability to retrieval noise. We explore whether LLMs can be made to
reliably attribute to the documents seen during (continual)
pretraining--without test-time retrieval--by revising the training process. To
evaluate this, we release CitePretrainBench, a benchmark that mixes real-world
corpora (Wikipedia, Common Crawl, arXiv) with novel, unseen documents and
probes both short-form (single fact) and long-form (multi-fact) citation tasks.
Our approach follows a two-stage process: (1) continual pretraining to bind
facts to persistent document identifiers, and (2) instruction tuning to elicit
citation behavior. We find that simple Passive Indexing, which appends an
identifier to each document, helps memorize verbatim text but fails on
paraphrased or compositional facts. Instead, we propose Active Indexing, which
continually pretrains on synthetic QA pairs that (1) restate each fact in
diverse compositional forms, and (2) require bidirectional source-to-fact and
fact-to-source generation, jointly teaching the model to generate content from
a cited source and to attribute its own answers. Experiments with Qwen2.5-7B
and 3B show that Active Indexing consistently outperforms Passive Indexing
across all tasks and models, with citation precision gains up to 30.2 percent.
Our ablation studies reveal that performance continues to improve as we scale
the amount of augmented data, showing a clear upward trend even at 16 times the
original token count.

Abstract: The real value of knowledge lies not just in its accumulation, but in its
potential to be harnessed effectively to conquer the unknown. Although recent
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit impressing multimodal
capabilities, they often fail in rarely encountered domain-specific tasks due
to limited relevant knowledge. To explore this, we adopt visual game cognition
as a testbed and select Monster Hunter: World as the target to construct a
multimodal knowledge graph (MH-MMKG), which incorporates multi-modalities and
intricate entity relations. We also design a series of challenging queries
based on MH-MMKG to evaluate the models' ability for complex knowledge
retrieval and reasoning. Furthermore, we propose a multi-agent retriever that
enables a model to autonomously search relevant knowledge without additional
training. Experimental results show that our approach significantly enhances
the performance of MLLMs, providing a new perspective on multimodal
knowledge-augmented reasoning and laying a solid foundation for future
research.

Abstract: Capture-the-Flag (CTF) competitions are crucial for cybersecurity education
and training. As large language models (LLMs) evolve, there is increasing
interest in their ability to automate CTF challenge solving. For example, DARPA
has organized the AIxCC competition since 2023 to advance AI-powered automated
offense and defense. However, this demands a combination of multiple abilities,
from knowledge to reasoning and further to actions. In this paper, we highlight
the importance of technical knowledge in solving CTF problems and deliberately
construct a focused benchmark, CTFKnow, with 3,992 questions to measure LLMs'
performance in this core aspect. Our study offers a focused and innovative
measurement of LLMs' capability in understanding CTF knowledge and applying it
to solve CTF challenges. Our key findings reveal that while LLMs possess
substantial technical knowledge, they falter in accurately applying this
knowledge to specific scenarios and adapting their strategies based on feedback
from the CTF environment.
  Based on insights derived from this measurement study, we propose CTFAgent, a
novel LLM-driven framework for advancing CTF problem-solving. CTFAgent
introduces two new modules: two-stage Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and
interactive Environmental Augmentation, which enhance LLMs' technical knowledge
and vulnerability exploitation on CTF, respectively. Our experimental results
show that, on two popular CTF datasets, CTFAgent both achieves over 80%
performance improvement. Moreover, in the recent picoCTF2024 hosted by CMU,
CTFAgent ranked in the top 23.6% of nearly 7,000 participating teams. This
reflects the benefit of our measurement study and the potential of our
framework in advancing LLMs' capabilities in CTF problem-solving.

Abstract: Physics problem-solving is a challenging domain for large AI models,
requiring integration of conceptual understanding, mathematical reasoning, and
interpretation of physical diagrams. Current evaluation methodologies show
notable limitations in capturing the breadth and complexity of
undergraduate-level physics, underscoring the need for more rigorous
assessments. To this end, we present PhysUniBench, a large-scale multimodal
benchmark designed to evaluate and improve the reasoning capabilities of
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) specifically on undergraduate-level
physics problems. PhysUniBench consists of 3,304 physics questions spanning 8
major sub-disciplines of physics, each accompanied by one visual diagrams. The
benchmark includes both open-ended and multiple-choice questions,
systematically curated and difficulty-rated through an iterative
model-in-the-loop process. The benchmark's construction involved a rigorous
multi-stage process, including multiple roll-outs, expert-level evaluation,
automated filtering of easily solved problems, and a nuanced difficulty grading
system with five levels. Through extensive experiments, we observe that current
state-of-the-art models encounter substantial challenges in physics reasoning.
For example, GPT-4o mini achieves only about 34.2\% accuracy in the proposed
PhysUniBench. These results highlight that current MLLMs struggle with advanced
physics reasoning, especially on multi-step problems and those requiring
precise diagram interpretation. By providing a broad and rigorous assessment
tool, PhysUniBench aims to drive progress in AI for Science, encouraging the
development of models with stronger physical reasoning, problem-solving skills,
and multimodal understanding. The benchmark and evaluation scripts are

### [282] [Beyond Syntax: Action Semantics Learning for App Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17697)
*Bohan Tang,Dezhao Luo,Jingxuan Chen,Shaogang Gong,Jianye Hao,Jun Wang,Kun Shao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ASL的新学习框架，通过捕捉动作语义而非语法形式来提升App代理的准确性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于提示的解决方案依赖封闭LLM API，计算成本高且依赖外部API；而微调开源LLM的方法因语法学习范式易受OOD问题影响。

Method: 提出ASL框架，定义动作语义为界面状态转换，并设计SEE计算语义奖励以训练代理生成语义对齐的动作。

Result: 理论分析和实验表明，ASL在OOD问题上优于现有语法学习范式，显著提升了代理的准确性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: ASL通过语义学习解决了现有方法的局限性，为App代理提供了更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) enables the rise of App agents
that interpret user intent and operate smartphone Apps through actions such as
clicking and scrolling. While prompt-based solutions with closed LLM APIs show
promising ability, they incur heavy compute costs and external API dependency.
Fine-tuning smaller open-source LLMs solves these limitations. However, current
fine-tuning methods use a syntax learning paradigm that forces agents to
reproduce exactly the ground truth action strings, leading to
out-of-distribution (OOD) vulnerability. To fill this gap, we propose Action
Semantics Learning (ASL), a novel learning framework, where the learning
objective is capturing the semantics of the ground truth actions. Specifically,
inspired by the programming language theory, we define the action semantics for
App agents as the state transition induced by the action in the user interface.
With this insight, ASL employs a novel SEmantic Estimator (SEE) to compute a
semantic reward to train the App agents in generating actions aligned with the
semantics of ground truth actions, even when the syntactic forms differ. To
support the effectiveness of ASL, we theoretically demonstrate the superior
robustness of ASL for the OOD problem compared with the existing syntax
learning paradigm. Extensive experiments on offline and online smartphone App
operation benchmarks show that ASL significantly improves the accuracy and
generalisation of App agents over existing methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于顺序结构的多智能体协作框架，取代传统的图结构，通过动态选择智能体角色和上下文信息，提升灵活性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖静态或图结构的通信拓扑，缺乏适应性和灵活性。

Method: 提出Next-Agent Prediction和Next-Context Selection，动态构建任务自适应的通信管道。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，同时显著降低通信开销。

Conclusion: 顺序结构框架为多智能体协作提供了更高的灵活性和效率。

Abstract: Recent progress in large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent collaboration
highlights the power of structured communication in enabling collective
intelligence. However, existing methods largely rely on static or graph-based
inter-agent topologies, lacking the potential adaptability and flexibility in
communication. In this work, we propose a new framework that rethinks
multi-agent coordination through a sequential structure rather than a graph
structure, offering a significantly larger topology space for multi-agent
communication. Our method focuses on two key directions: (1) Next-Agent
Prediction, which selects the most suitable agent role at each step, and (2)
Next-Context Selection (NCS), which enables each agent to selectively access
relevant information from any previous step. Together, these components
construct task-adaptive communication pipelines that support both role
flexibility and global information flow. Extensive evaluations across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance while
substantially reducing communication overhead.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种混合推理框架，结合结构化概率模型和LLM，解决了大型语言模型在社交推理任务中的局限性，并在Avalon游戏中击败了人类玩家。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在社交推理任务（如推断其他代理的信念和意图）中表现有限，尤其是在小型实时模型上表现不佳。

Method: 引入混合推理框架，将信念推断外化到结构化概率模型，同时利用LLM处理语言理解和交互。

Result: 该方法在Agent-Agent游戏中表现优异，击败人类玩家（67%胜率），并获得比基准和人类队友更高的评价。

Conclusion: 混合推理框架显著提升了LLM在社交推理任务中的性能，为未来研究提供了代码、模型和数据集支持。

Abstract: Social reasoning - inferring unobservable beliefs and intentions from partial
observations of other agents - remains a challenging task for large language
models (LLMs). We evaluate the limits of current reasoning language models in
the social deduction game Avalon and find that while the largest models
demonstrate strong performance, they require extensive test-time inference and
degrade sharply when distilled to smaller, real-time-capable variants. To
address this, we introduce a hybrid reasoning framework that externalizes
belief inference to a structured probabilistic model, while using an LLM for
language understanding and interaction. Our approach achieves competitive
performance with much larger models in Agent-Agent play and, notably, is the
first language agent to defeat human players in a controlled study - achieving
a 67% win rate and receiving higher qualitative ratings than both reasoning
baselines and human teammates. We release code, models, and a dataset to
support future work on social reasoning in LLM agents, which can be found at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统策略合成方法难以应对大规模状态空间，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 通过动态细化MDP并迭代选择最脆弱区域进行优化，平衡准确性与效率。

Result: 在包含1M状态的MDP中，性能比PRISM提升高达2倍。

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模MDP中的策略合成任务提供了高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Software-intensive systems, such as software product lines and robotics,
utilise Markov decision processes (MDPs) to capture uncertainty and analyse
sequential decision-making problems. Despite the usefulness of conventional
policy synthesis methods, they fail to scale to large state spaces. Our
approach addresses this issue and accelerates policy synthesis in large MDPs by
dynamically refining the MDP and iteratively selecting the most fragile MDP
regions for refinement. This iterative procedure offers a balance between
accuracy and efficiency, as refinement occurs only when necessary. Through a
comprehensive empirical evaluation comprising diverse case studies and MDPs up
to 1M states, we demonstrate significant performance improvements yielded by
our approach compared to the leading probabilistic model checker PRISM (up to
2x), thus offering a very competitive solution for real-world policy synthesis
tasks in larger MDPs.

*Carter Blair,Kate Larson,Edith Law*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种个性化奖励建模方法，通过语言模型引导用户反思对话，构建个性化奖励模型，解决了传统RLHF方法中少数群体偏好被压制的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类价值观具有多样性，传统RLHF方法通过单一奖励模型聚合反馈可能压制少数群体偏好，因此需要一种个性化奖励建模方法。

Method: 使用语言模型引导用户进行反思对话，构建个性化对话历史，并以此作为上下文训练个性化奖励模型（“语言奖励模型”）。

Result: 在30名参与者的实验中，该方法比非反思性语言奖励模型准确率提高了9-12%，且样本效率高于传统监督学习方法。

Conclusion: 个性化奖励建模方法能更准确地捕捉用户偏好，同时提高样本效率，为AI代理对齐人类价值观提供了新思路。

Abstract: AI agents are commonly aligned with "human values" through reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF), where a single reward model is learned
from aggregated human feedback and used to align an agent's behavior. However,
human values are not homogeneous--different people hold distinct and sometimes
conflicting values. Aggregating feedback into a single reward model risks
disproportionately suppressing minority preferences. To address this, we
present a novel reward modeling approach for learning individualized reward
models. Our approach uses a language model to guide users through reflective
dialogues where they critique agent behavior and construct their preferences.
This personalized dialogue history, containing the user's reflections and
critiqued examples, is then used as context for another language model that
serves as an individualized reward function (what we call a "verbal reward
model") for evaluating new trajectories. In studies with 30 participants, our
method achieved a 9-12% improvement in accuracy over non-reflective verbal
reward models while being more sample efficient than traditional supervised
learning methods.

Motivation: 当前AI安全和机制可解释性研究在泛化性和控制框架互操作性方面存在不足，需要更全面的对齐方法。

Result: 提出了一种基于形式最优控制理论的对齐框架，增强了AI系统的安全性和可靠性。

Conclusion: 通过结合最优控制理论和实际部署考虑，可以构建更全面的AI对齐框架，为政府和监管机构提供所需保障。

Abstract: This position paper argues that formal optimal control theory should be
central to AI alignment research, offering a distinct perspective from
prevailing AI safety and security approaches. While recent work in AI safety
and mechanistic interpretability has advanced formal methods for alignment,
they often fall short of the generalisation required of control frameworks for
other technologies. There is also a lack of research into how to render
different alignment/control protocols interoperable. We argue that by recasting
alignment through principles of formal optimal control and framing alignment in
terms of hierarchical stack from physical to socio-technical layers according
to which controls may be applied we can develop a better understanding of the
potential and limitations for controlling frontier models and agentic AI
systems. To this end, we introduce an Alignment Control Stack which sets out a
hierarchical layered alignment stack, identifying measurement and control
characteristics at each layer and how different layers are formally
interoperable. We argue that such analysis is also key to the assurances that
will be needed by governments and regulators in order to see AI technologies
sustainably benefit the community. Our position is that doing so will bridge
the well-established and empirically validated methods of optimal control with
practical deployment considerations to create a more comprehensive alignment
framework, enhancing how we approach safety and reliability for advanced AI
systems.

Result: 在基准数据集（FEVEROUS、HOVER、SciFact）上，系统比基线方法在Macro F1分数上提升了12.3%。

Conclusion: 该方法为自动化事实核查领域提供了更准确、高效且透明的验证方法，同时保持了实际应用的扩展性。

Abstract: The rapid spread of misinformation in the digital era poses significant
challenges to public discourse, necessitating robust and scalable fact-checking
solutions. Traditional human-led fact-checking methods, while credible,
struggle with the volume and velocity of online content, prompting the
integration of automated systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, existing automated approaches often face limitations, such as handling
complex claims, ensuring source credibility, and maintaining transparency. This
paper proposes a novel multi-agent system for automated fact-checking that
enhances accuracy, efficiency, and explainability. The system comprises four
specialized agents: an Input Ingestion Agent for claim decomposition, a Query
Generation Agent for formulating targeted subqueries, an Evidence Retrieval
Agent for sourcing credible evidence, and a Verdict Prediction Agent for
synthesizing veracity judgments with human-interpretable explanations.
Evaluated on benchmark datasets (FEVEROUS, HOVER, SciFact), the proposed system
achieves a 12.3% improvement in Macro F1-score over baseline methods. The
system effectively decomposes complex claims, retrieves reliable evidence from
trusted sources, and generates transparent explanations for verification
decisions. Our approach contributes to the growing field of automated
fact-checking by providing a more accurate, efficient, and transparent
verification methodology that aligns with human fact-checking practices while
maintaining scalability for real-world applications. Our source code is

Motivation: 随着云平台AI系统的复杂性和规模迅速扩大，日志数据量大、非结构化且语义模糊，给故障定位和系统自修复带来巨大挑战。

Method: 扩展预训练Transformer模型，结合多阶段语义推理机制，动态结构化日志，提取事件模板和语义模式，利用微调LLM和多轮注意力机制进行上下文推理，生成故障假设和根因路径，并引入基于强化学习的策略引导恢复规划器。

Result: 实验表明，LLM-ID在云平台日志数据集上故障定位准确率提升了16.2%，优于主流方法。

Conclusion: LLM-ID具有更强的语义理解能力、持续学习能力和异构环境适应性，为云平台故障定位和自修复提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: With the increasing complexity and rapid expansion of the scale of AI systems
in cloud platforms, the log data generated during system operation is massive,
unstructured, and semantically ambiguous, which brings great challenges to
fault location and system self-repair. In order to solve this problem, this
paper proposes an intelligent log processing and automatic debugging framework
based on Large Language Model (LLM), named Intelligent Debugger (LLM-ID). This
method is extended on the basis of the existing pre-trained Transformer model,
and integrates a multi-stage semantic inference mechanism to realize the
context understanding of system logs and the automatic reconstruction of fault
chains. Firstly, the system log is dynamically structured, and the unsupervised
clustering and embedding mechanism is used to extract the event template and
semantic schema. Subsequently, the fine-tuned LLM combined with the multi-round
attention mechanism to perform contextual reasoning on the log sequence to
generate potential fault assumptions and root cause paths. Furthermore, this
paper introduces a reinforcement learning-based policy-guided recovery planner,
which is driven by the remediation strategy generated by LLM to support dynamic
decision-making and adaptive debugging in the cloud environment. Compared with
the existing rule engine or traditional log analysis system, the proposed model
has stronger semantic understanding ability, continuous learning ability and
heterogeneous environment adaptability. Experiments on the cloud platform log
dataset show that LLM-ID improves the fault location accuracy by 16.2%, which
is significantly better than the current mainstream methods

Motivation: 现有GUI代理系统依赖试错决策，缺乏渐进式推理能力，且评估指标过于简单，无法反映真实GUI交互的复杂性。

Method: 结合Kahneman的双过程理论，设计了一个包含视觉语义分析引擎（omni parser）和基于相对奖励的优化代理（GRPO）的双系统框架。

Result: CogniGUI在现有基准测试和新提出的ScreenSeek基准测试中均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CogniGUI通过自适应学习和高效交互路径优化，显著提升了GUI代理的性能和适应性。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents have made significant progress in
automating digital tasks through the utilization of computer vision and
language models. Nevertheless, existing agent systems encounter notable
limitations. Firstly, they predominantly depend on trial and error decision
making rather than progressive reasoning, thereby lacking the capability to
learn and adapt from interactive encounters. Secondly, these systems are
assessed using overly simplistic single step accuracy metrics, which do not
adequately reflect the intricate nature of real world GUI interactions. In this
paper, we present CogniGUI, a cognitive framework developed to overcome these
limitations by enabling adaptive learning for GUI automation resembling
human-like behavior. Inspired by Kahneman's Dual Process Theory, our approach
combines two main components: (1) an omni parser engine that conducts immediate
hierarchical parsing of GUI elements through quick visual semantic analysis to
identify actionable components, and (2) a Group based Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) grounding agent that assesses multiple interaction paths
using a unique relative reward system, promoting minimal and efficient
operational routes. This dual-system design facilitates iterative ''exploration
learning mastery'' cycles, enabling the agent to enhance its strategies over
time based on accumulated experience. Moreover, to assess the generalization
and adaptability of agent systems, we introduce ScreenSeek, a comprehensive
benchmark that includes multi application navigation, dynamic state
transitions, and cross interface coherence, which are often overlooked
challenges in current benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that
CogniGUI surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both the current GUI grounding
benchmarks and our newly proposed benchmark.

Result: 在分类、多选问答、生成和数学推理任务中表现优异，且运行效率良好。

Conclusion: 该研究为上下文学习机制研究提供了新方向，并呼吁开发更开放的搜索算法以优化LLM提示。

Abstract: We propose a novel prompt design paradigm that challenges conventional wisdom
in large language model (LLM) prompting. While conventional wisdom prioritizes
well-crafted instructions and demonstrations for in-context learning (ICL), we
show that pruning random demonstrations into seemingly incoherent "gibberish"
can remarkably improve performance across diverse tasks. Notably, the
"gibberish" always matches or surpasses state-of-the-art automatic prompt
optimization techniques, achieving substantial gains regardless of LLM
alignment. Nevertheless, discovering an effective pruning strategy is
non-trivial, as existing attribution methods and prompt compression algorithms
fail to deliver robust results, let alone human intuition. In terms of this, we
propose a self-discover prompt optimization framework, PromptQuine, an
evolutionary search framework that automatically searches for the pruning
strategy by itself using only low-data regimes. Much like the emergent
complexity in nature--such as symbiosis and self-organization--arising in
response to resource constraints, our framework evolves and refines
unconventional yet highly effective prompts by leveraging only the tokens
present within the context. We demonstrate its effectiveness across
classification, multi-choice question answering, generation and math reasoning
tasks across LLMs, while achieving decent runtime efficiency. We hope our
findings can guide mechanistic studies on in-context learning, and provide a
call to action, to pave the way for more open-ended search algorithms for more
effective LLM prompting.

Abstract: The role of pharmacists is evolving from medicine dispensing to delivering
comprehensive pharmaceutical services within multidisciplinary healthcare
teams. Central to this shift is access to accurate, up-to-date medicinal
product information supported by robust data integration. Leveraging artificial
intelligence and semantic technologies, Knowledge Graphs (KGs) uncover hidden
relationships and enable data-driven decision-making. This paper presents
medicX-KG, a pharmacist-oriented knowledge graph supporting clinical and
regulatory decisions. It forms the semantic layer of the broader medicX
platform, powering predictive and explainable pharmacy services. medicX-KG
integrates data from three sources, including, the British National Formulary
(BNF), DrugBank, and the Malta Medicines Authority (MMA) that addresses Malta's
regulatory landscape and combines European Medicines Agency alignment with
partial UK supply dependence. The KG tackles the absence of a unified national
drug repository, reducing pharmacists' reliance on fragmented sources. Its
design was informed by interviews with practicing pharmacists to ensure
real-world applicability. We detail the KG's construction, including data
extraction, ontology design, and semantic mapping. Evaluation demonstrates that
medicX-KG effectively supports queries about drug availability, interactions,
adverse reactions, and therapeutic classes. Limitations, including missing
detailed dosage encoding and real-time updates, are discussed alongside
directions for future enhancements.

Abstract: AI agents have experienced a paradigm shift, from early dominance by
reinforcement learning (RL) to the rise of agents powered by large language
models (LLMs), and now further advancing towards a synergistic fusion of RL and
LLM capabilities. This progression has endowed AI agents with increasingly
strong abilities. Despite these advances, to accomplish complex real-world
tasks, agents are required to plan and execute effectively, maintain reliable
memory, and coordinate smoothly with other agents. Achieving these capabilities
involves contending with ever-present intricate information, operations, and
interactions. In light of this challenge, data structurization can play a
promising role by transforming intricate and disorganized data into
well-structured forms that agents can more effectively understand and process.
In this context, graphs, with their natural advantage in organizing, managing,
and harnessing intricate data relationships, present a powerful data paradigm
for structurization to support the capabilities demanded by advanced AI agents.
To this end, this survey presents a first systematic review of how graphs can
empower AI agents. Specifically, we explore the integration of graph techniques
with core agent functionalities, highlight notable applications, and identify
prospective avenues for future research. By comprehensively surveying this
burgeoning intersection, we hope to inspire the development of next-generation
AI agents equipped to tackle increasingly sophisticated challenges with graphs.

Motivation: 传统动作语言与现代ASP语言之间存在表达能力的差距，限制了其在知识表示中的应用。

Method: 通过定义BC+的语义基于命题公式的稳定模型语义，将现代ASP语言构造（如选择规则、聚合等）视为命题公式的简写。

Result: BC+能够涵盖其他动作语言（如B、C、C+、BC）的最佳特性，并可通过ASP求解器实现计算。

Conclusion: BC+成功填补了动作语言与现代ASP语言之间的差距，并通过扩展系统cplus2asp实现了该语言。

Abstract: Action languages are formal models of parts of natural language that are
designed to describe effects of actions. Many of these languages can be viewed
as high level notations of answer set programs structured to represent
transition systems. However, the form of answer set programs considered in the
earlier work is quite limited in comparison with the modern Answer Set
Programming (ASP) language, which allows several useful constructs for
knowledge representation, such as choice rules, aggregates, and abstract
constraint atoms. We propose a new action language called BC+, which closes the
gap between action languages and the modern ASP language. The main idea is to
define the semantics of BC+ in terms of general stable model semantics for
propositional formulas, under which many modern ASP language constructs can be
identified with shorthands for propositional formulas. Language BC+ turns out
to be sufficiently expressive to encompass the best features of other action
languages, such as languages B, C, C+, and BC. Computational methods available
in ASP solvers are readily applicable to compute BC+, which led to an
implementation of the language by extending system cplus2asp.

These agents are designed to tackle complex, multi-turn informational research
tasks by leveraging a combination of dynamic reasoning, adaptive long-horizon
planning, multi-hop information retrieval, iterative tool use, and the
generation of structured analytical reports. In this paper, we conduct a
detailed analysis of the foundational technologies and architectural components
that constitute Deep Research agents. We begin by reviewing information
acquisition strategies, contrasting API-based retrieval methods with
browser-based exploration. We then examine modular tool-use frameworks,
including code execution, multimodal input processing, and the integration of
Model Context Protocols (MCPs) to support extensibility and ecosystem
development. To systematize existing approaches, we propose a taxonomy that
differentiates between static and dynamic workflows, and we classify agent
architectures based on planning strategies and agent composition, including
single-agent and multi-agent configurations. We also provide a critical
evaluation of current benchmarks, highlighting key limitations such as
restricted access to external knowledge, sequential execution inefficiencies,
and misalignment between evaluation metrics and the practical objectives of DR
agents. Finally, we outline open challenges and promising directions for future
research. A curated and continuously updated repository of DR agent research is

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CI-HRL的两层框架，用于解决多约束追逃游戏中无人机群的协同规避与形成覆盖任务，通过高层的共识推断和低层的强化学习实现高效协作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多约束追逃游戏中的协同规避与形成覆盖任务在通信受限条件下极具挑战性，需解决高维复杂问题。

Method: 采用共识推断分层强化学习（CI-HRL），高层策略通过ConsMAC模块实现全局信息感知与共识建立，低层策略使用AT-M和策略蒸馏完成控制。

Result: 实验验证CI-HRL在协同规避和任务完成能力上表现优异。

Conclusion: CI-HRL为复杂环境下的无人机群协作提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Multiple quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems have garnered
widespread research interest and fostered tremendous interesting applications,
especially in multi-constrained pursuit-evasion games (MC-PEG). The Cooperative
Evasion and Formation Coverage (CEFC) task, where the UAV swarm aims to
maximize formation coverage across multiple target zones while collaboratively
evading predators, belongs to one of the most challenging issues in MC-PEG,
especially under communication-limited constraints. This multifaceted problem,
which intertwines responses to obstacles, adversaries, target zones, and
formation dynamics, brings up significant high-dimensional complications in
locating a solution. In this paper, we propose a novel two-level framework
(i.e., Consensus Inference-based Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (CI-HRL)),
which delegates target localization to a high-level policy, while adopting a
low-level policy to manage obstacle avoidance, navigation, and formation.
Specifically, in the high-level policy, we develop a novel multi-agent
reinforcement learning module, Consensus-oriented Multi-Agent Communication
(ConsMAC), to enable agents to perceive global information and establish
consensus from local states by effectively aggregating neighbor messages.
Meanwhile, we leverage an Alternative Training-based Multi-agent proximal
policy optimization (AT-M) and policy distillation to accomplish the low-level
control. The experimental results, including the high-fidelity
software-in-the-loop (SITL) simulations, validate that CI-HRL provides a
superior solution with enhanced swarm's collaborative evasion and task
completion capabilities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了模型合并的机制，提出了一种自增强框架SE-Merging，通过动态识别任务和调整合并系数提升多任务能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管模型合并在实践中表现出色，但其机制尚不明确，研究旨在揭示其背后的工作原理。

Method: 从表示角度分析模型合并，发现其通过区分任务样本和适应专家模型实现多任务能力，并提出了SE-Merging框架。

Result: SE-Merging在不增加训练的情况下显著提升了性能，且与现有技术兼容。

Conclusion: 模型合并的多任务能力源于任务区分和专家适应，SE-Merging进一步优化了这一过程。

Abstract: Model merging has gained increasing attention due to its intriguing property:
interpolating the parameters of different task-specific fine-tuned models leads
to multi-task abilities. However, despite its empirical success, the underlying
mechanisms of model merging remain poorly understood. In this work, we delve
into the mechanism behind model merging from a representation perspective. Our
analysis reveals that model merging achieves multi-task abilities through two
key capabilities: i) distinguishing samples from different tasks, and ii)
adapting to the corresponding expert model for each sample. These two
capabilities allow the merged model to retain task-specific expertise, enabling
efficient multi-task adaptation. Building on these insights, we propose
\texttt{SE-Merging}, a self-enhanced model merging framework that leverages
these two characteristics to dynamically identify the corresponding task for
each sample and then adaptively rescales the merging coefficients to further
enhance task-specific expertise in the merged model. Notably,
\texttt{SE-Merging} achieves dynamic model merging without additional training.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{SE-Merging} achieves significant
performance improvements while remaining compatible with existing model merging
techniques.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了CoachGPT，一种基于大型语言模型的写作助手，旨在为学术写作提供个性化反馈和指导，弥补传统写作助手的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学术写作对学生至关重要，但传统方法（如教师指导或字典查询）和早期写作助手存在局限性，如缺乏上下文理解或成本高昂。大型语言模型虽强大，但直接生成答案可能不利于学习。

Method: 开发CoachGPT，基于大型语言模型，通过教育者指令生成子任务，并提供实时反馈和建议。

Result: 用户研究证明CoachGPT在学术写作中的实用性和潜力，提供沉浸式写作体验。

Conclusion: CoachGPT通过独特的脚手架结构，为学术写作提供有效支持，展示了大型语言模型在教育领域的潜力。

Abstract: Academic writing skills are crucial for students' success, but can feel
overwhelming without proper guidance and practice, particularly when writing in
a second language. Traditionally, students ask instructors or search
dictionaries, which are not universally accessible. Early writing assistants
emerged as rule-based systems that focused on detecting misspellings,
subject-verb disagreements, and basic punctuation errors; however, they are
inaccurate and lack contextual understanding. Machine learning-based assistants
demonstrate a strong ability for language understanding but are expensive to
train. Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in
generating responses in natural languages based on given prompts. Still, they
have a fundamental limitation in education: they generate essays without
teaching, which can have detrimental effects on learning when misused. To
address this limitation, we develop CoachGPT, which leverages large language
models (LLMs) to assist individuals with limited educational resources and
those who prefer self-paced learning in academic writing. CoachGPT is an AI
agent-based web application that (1) takes instructions from experienced
educators, (2) converts instructions into sub-tasks, and (3) provides real-time
feedback and suggestions using large language models. This unique scaffolding
structure makes CoachGPT unique among existing writing assistants. Compared to
existing writing assistants, CoachGPT provides a more immersive writing
experience with personalized feedback and guidance. Our user studies prove the
usefulness of CoachGPT and the potential of large language models for academic
writing.

Motivation: 探索LLMs是否具有人类认知特征，以评估其透明度和伦理部署。

Method: 使用结构化提示和自动评分，评估多个专有和开源模型。

Result: 模型能生成连贯叙述，易受积极框架影响，道德判断偏向自由/压迫问题，并表现出自我矛盾但合理化。

Conclusion: 研究为AI透明度和伦理部署提供启示，并建议未来结合认知心理学与AI安全。

Abstract: We investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit human-like
cognitive patterns under four established frameworks from psychology: Thematic
Apperception Test (TAT), Framing Bias, Moral Foundations Theory (MFT), and
Cognitive Dissonance. We evaluated several proprietary and open-source models
using structured prompts and automated scoring. Our findings reveal that these
models often produce coherent narratives, show susceptibility to positive
framing, exhibit moral judgments aligned with Liberty/Oppression concerns, and
demonstrate self-contradictions tempered by extensive rationalization. Such
behaviors mirror human cognitive tendencies yet are shaped by their training
data and alignment methods. We discuss the implications for AI transparency,
ethical deployment, and future work that bridges cognitive psychology and AI
safety

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Chain-of-Memory (CoM)的新方法，用于显式建模GUI代理的短期和长期记忆，显著提升了跨应用任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖历史截图或动作隐式表示任务状态，导致GUI代理难以准确理解任务状态，缺乏有效机制存储复杂跨应用任务中的关键信息。

Method: CoM通过捕获动作描述、整合任务相关屏幕信息，并维护专用内存模块来存储和管理信息，实现显式记忆表示。

Result: 实验表明，CoM显著提升了GUI代理在跨应用任务中的性能，并使7B模型具备与72B模型相当的内存管理能力。

Conclusion: CoM为GUI代理提供了显式记忆管理能力，解决了任务状态理解和历史信息存储的挑战，数据集和代码将开源。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are attracting growing attention in
the development of Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents. Existing approaches
often rely on historical screenshots or actions to implicitly represent the
task state. This reliance poses challenges for GUI agents in accurately
understanding task states and underscores the absence of effective mechanisms
to store critical information in complex and lengthy cross-app tasks. To
address these challenges, we propose Chain-of-Memory (CoM), a novel approach
for explicitly modeling short-term and long-term memory in GUI agents. CoM
achieves this by capturing action descriptions, integrating task-relevant
screen information, and maintaining a dedicated memory module to store and
manage this information. By leveraging explicit memory representations, CoM
enables GUI agents to better understand task states and retain critical
historical information persistently. To equip GUI agents with memory management
capabilities and evaluate the effectiveness of CoM, we developed the GUI
Odyssey-CoM, a dataset comprising 111k screen-action pairs annotated with
Chain-of-Memory. Experimental results demonstrate that CoM significantly
improves GUI agents' performance in cross-application tasks. Additionally, GUI
Odyssey-CoM enables 7B models to achieve memory management capabilities
comparable to 72B models. The dataset and code will be open-sourced.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了推理语言模型的不确定性量化问题，发现模型通常过于自信，尤其是错误答案时，且更深层次的推理会加剧这一问题。通过自省方法可以改善部分模型的校准，但效果不一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理模型在生成答案时容易产生自信但错误的幻觉，了解何时信任模型对安全部署至关重要。

Method: 引入自省不确定性量化（UQ），评估模型校准情况，并测试自省方法对校准的影响。

Result: 推理模型通常过于自信（尤其是错误时），更深推理会加剧这一问题；自省方法可改善部分模型校准，但效果不一致。

Conclusion: 需进一步研究设计UQ基准和改进推理模型校准的方法。

Abstract: Reasoning language models have set state-of-the-art (SOTA) records on many
challenging benchmarks, enabled by multi-step reasoning induced using
reinforcement learning. However, like previous language models, reasoning
models are prone to generating confident, plausible responses that are
incorrect (hallucinations). Knowing when and how much to trust these models is
critical to the safe deployment of reasoning models in real-world applications.
To this end, we explore uncertainty quantification of reasoning models in this
work. Specifically, we ask three fundamental questions: First, are reasoning
models well-calibrated? Second, does deeper reasoning improve model
calibration? Finally, inspired by humans' innate ability to double-check their
thought processes to verify the validity of their answers and their confidence,
we ask: can reasoning models improve their calibration by explicitly reasoning
about their chain-of-thought traces? We introduce introspective uncertainty
quantification (UQ) to explore this direction. In extensive evaluations on SOTA
reasoning models across a broad range of benchmarks, we find that reasoning
models: (i) are typically overconfident, with self-verbalized confidence
estimates often greater than 85% particularly for incorrect responses, (ii)
become even more overconfident with deeper reasoning, and (iii) can become
better calibrated through introspection (e.g., o3-Mini and DeepSeek R1) but not
uniformly (e.g., Claude 3.7 Sonnet becomes more poorly calibrated). Lastly, we
conclude with important research directions to design necessary UQ benchmarks
and improve the calibration of reasoning models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨药物不依从性对精神分裂症患者不良后果的影响，为临床和政策提供依据。

Method: 采用生存分析框架，结合T-learner、S-learner和最近邻匹配等因果推断方法，利用不同时间段的纵向数据（3、6、9、12个月）。

Result: 发现不依从性使不良事件提前1至4个月发生，且不同药物类型和剂型结果一致。

Conclusion: 研究强调了药物依从性的重要性，并展示了生存分析与因果推断结合的政策价值，但需注意因果解释的假设。

Abstract: This study quantifies the association between non-adherence to antipsychotic
medications and adverse outcomes in individuals with schizophrenia. We frame
the problem using survival analysis, focusing on the time to the earliest of
several adverse events (early death, involuntary hospitalization, jail
booking). We extend standard causal inference methods (T-learner, S-learner,
nearest neighbor matching) to utilize various survival models to estimate
individual and average treatment effects, where treatment corresponds to
medication non-adherence. Analyses are repeated using different amounts of
longitudinal information (3, 6, 9, and 12 months). Using data from Allegheny
County in western Pennsylvania, we find strong evidence that non-adherence
advances adverse outcomes by approximately 1 to 4 months. Ablation studies
confirm that county-provided risk scores adjust for key confounders, as their
removal amplifies the estimated effects. Subgroup analyses by medication
formulation (injectable vs. oral) and medication type consistently show that
non-adherence is associated with earlier adverse events. These findings
highlight the clinical importance of adherence in delaying psychiatric crises
and show that integrating survival analysis with causal inference tools can
yield policy-relevant insights. We caution that although we apply causal
inference, we only make associative claims and discuss assumptions needed for
causal interpretation.

Result: 框架提升评估的透明性、可比性和可解释性，帮助识别方法弱点并支持政策制定。

Conclusion: 该框架为AI能力评估提供了实用工具，适用于研究者、实践者和政策制定者。

Abstract: As AI systems advance and integrate into society, well-designed and
transparent evaluations are becoming essential tools in AI governance,
informing decisions by providing evidence about system capabilities and risks.
Yet there remains a lack of clarity on how to perform these assessments both
comprehensively and reliably. To address this gap, we propose a conceptual
framework for analyzing AI capability evaluations, offering a structured,
descriptive approach that systematizes the analysis of widely used methods and
terminology without imposing new taxonomies or rigid formats. This framework
supports transparency, comparability, and interpretability across diverse
evaluations. It also enables researchers to identify methodological weaknesses,
assists practitioners in designing evaluations, and provides policymakers with
an accessible tool to scrutinize, compare, and navigate complex evaluation
landscapes.

Motivation: 探索模型扩展的第四维度（VLD），研究参数复用对模型性能的影响，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 通过精心设计的对照实验，分析VLD扩展对知识容量和推理能力的影响。

Result: VLD扩展能显著提升推理能力，但对知识容量影响较小；参数数量与推理能力无关。

Conclusion: 在特定条件下，无需增加参数即可提升推理能力，这一发现在多种模型配置中均成立。

Abstract: Scaling the size of large language models typically involves three
dimensions: depth, width, and the number of parameters. In this work, we
explore a fourth dimension, virtual logical depth (VLD), which increases the
effective algorithmic depth without changing the overall parameter count by
reusing parameters within the model. Although parameter reuse is not a new
concept, its potential and characteristics in model scaling have not been
thoroughly studied. Through carefully designed controlled experiments, we make
the following key discoveries regarding VLD scaling:
  VLD scaling forces the knowledge capacity of the model to remain almost
constant, with only minor variations.
  VLD scaling enables a significant improvement in reasoning capability,
provided the scaling method is properly implemented.
  The number of parameters correlates with knowledge capacity, but not with
reasoning capability. Under certain conditions, it is not necessary to increase
the parameter count to enhance reasoning.
  These findings are consistent across various model configurations and are
likely to be generally valid within the scope of our experiments.

Conclusion: 模拟互动和同行评审动态对LLM自主研究具有重要价值。

Abstract: Scientific progress increasingly relies on effective collaboration among
researchers, a dynamic that large language models (LLMs) have only begun to
emulate. While recent LLM-based scientist agents show promise in autonomous
scientific discovery, they often lack the interactive reasoning and evaluation
mechanisms essential to real-world research. We propose IDVSCI (Internal
Discussion and Vote SCIentists), a multi-agent framework built on LLMs that
incorporates two key innovations: a Dynamic Knowledge Exchange mechanism
enabling iterative feedback among agents, and a Dual-Diversity Review paradigm
that simulates heterogeneous expert evaluation. These components jointly
promote deeper reasoning and the generation of more creative and impactful
scientific ideas. To evaluate the effectiveness and generalizability of our
approach, we conduct experiments on two datasets: a widely used benchmark in
computer science and a new dataset we introduce in the health sciences domain.
Results show that IDVSCI consistently achieves the best performance across both
datasets, outperforming existing systems such as AI Scientist and VIRSCI. These
findings highlight the value of modeling interaction and peer review dynamics
in LLM-based autonomous research.

Result: 在3类电路上测试，优化效率提升2.32至26.6倍。

Conclusion: LLM能有效修剪模拟电路尺寸的搜索空间，为LLM与传统设计方法的结合提供新方案。

Abstract: In the design process of the analog circuit pre-layout phase, device sizing
is an important step in determining whether an analog circuit can meet the
required performance metrics. Many existing techniques extract the circuit
sizing task as a mathematical optimization problem to solve and continuously
improve the optimization efficiency from a mathematical perspective. But they
ignore the automatic introduction of prior knowledge, fail to achieve effective
pruning of the search space, which thereby leads to a considerable compression
margin remaining in the search space. To alleviate this problem, we propose a
large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent framework for analog circuits'
sizing relationships extraction from academic papers. The search space in the
sizing process can be effectively pruned based on the sizing relationship
extracted by this framework. Eventually, we conducted tests on 3 types of
circuits, and the optimization efficiency was improved by $2.32 \sim 26.6
\times$. This work demonstrates that the LLM can effectively prune the search
space for analog circuit sizing, providing a new solution for the combination
of LLMs and conventional analog circuit design automation methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现，模型编辑后的行为在微调过程中通常无法持久，即使微调与编辑无关。这揭示了当前编辑方法的局限性，并强调了开发更鲁棒技术的必要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨模型编辑与微调之间的交互作用，以解决编辑行为是否会在微调后保留的问题，这对AI安全和实际应用具有重要意义。

Method: 在T2I扩散模型（Stable Diffusion和FLUX）上，结合两种编辑技术（UCE和ReFACT）和三种微调方法（DreamBooth、LoRA和DoRA），通过广泛的实证分析进行研究。

Result: 编辑行为在微调后普遍失效，其中DoRA的编辑反转效果最强，而UCE在微调后保留的编辑效果优于ReFACT。

Conclusion: 当前编辑方法在微调后难以持久，需开发更鲁棒的技术以确保AI系统的长期控制和安全性。同时，微调可作为恶意编辑的补救手段，但需在微调后重新编辑以维持有益的安全属性。

Abstract: Model editing offers a low-cost technique to inject or correct a particular
behavior in a pre-trained model without extensive retraining, supporting
applications such as factual correction and bias mitigation. Despite this
common practice, it remains unknown whether edits persist after fine-tuning or
whether they are inadvertently reversed. This question has fundamental
practical implications. For example, if fine-tuning removes prior edits, it
could serve as a defence mechanism against hidden malicious edits. Vice versa,
the unintended removal of edits related to bias mitigation could pose serious
safety concerns. We systematically investigate the interaction between model
editing and fine-tuning in the context of T2I diffusion models, which are known
to exhibit biases and generate inappropriate content. Our study spans two T2I
model families (Stable Diffusion and FLUX), two sota editing techniques, and
three fine-tuning methods (DreamBooth, LoRA, and DoRA). Through an extensive
empirical analysis across diverse editing tasks and evaluation metrics, our
findings reveal a trend: edits generally fail to persist through fine-tuning,
even when fine-tuning is tangential or unrelated to the edits. Notably, we
observe that DoRA exhibits the strongest edit reversal effect. At the same
time, among editing methods, UCE demonstrates greater robustness, retaining
significantly higher efficacy post-fine-tuning compared to ReFACT. These
findings highlight a crucial limitation in current editing methodologies,
emphasizing the need for more robust techniques to ensure reliable long-term
control and alignment of deployed AI systems. These findings have dual
implications for AI safety: they suggest that fine-tuning could serve as a
remediation mechanism for malicious edits while simultaneously highlighting the
need for re-editing after fine-tuning to maintain beneficial safety and
alignment properties.

Conclusion: 该系统为标准化适用性推理提供了首个端到端解决方案，支持可扩展且可解释的AI辅助监管科学。

Abstract: Identifying the appropriate regulatory standard applicability remains a
critical yet understudied challenge in medical device compliance, frequently
necessitating expert interpretation of fragmented and heterogeneous
documentation across different jurisdictions. To address this challenge, we
introduce a modular AI system that leverages a retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) pipeline to automate standard applicability determination. Given a
free-text device description, our system retrieves candidate standards from a
curated corpus and uses large language models to infer jurisdiction-specific
applicability, classified as Mandatory, Recommended, or Not Applicable, with
traceable justifications. We construct an international benchmark dataset of
medical device descriptions with expert-annotated standard mappings, and
evaluate our system against retrieval-only, zero-shot, and rule-based
baselines. The proposed approach attains a classification accuracy of 73% and a
Top-5 retrieval recall of 87%, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying
relevant regulatory standards. We introduce the first end-to-end system for
standard applicability reasoning, enabling scalable and interpretable
AI-supported regulatory science. Notably, our region-aware RAG agent performs
cross-jurisdictional reasoning between Chinese and U.S. standards, supporting
conflict resolution and applicability justification across regulatory
frameworks.

five pillars: Humans, Data, Process, System, and Governance. The development of
the question bank involved an iterative, multi-source approach, incorporating
insights from literature reviews, D&I guidelines, Responsible AI frameworks,
and a simulated user study. The simulated evaluation, conducted with 70
AI-generated personas related to different AI jobs, assessed the question
bank's relevance and effectiveness for AI inclusivity across diverse roles and
application domains. The findings highlight the importance of integrating D&I
principles into AI development workflows and governance structures. The
question bank provides an actionable tool for researchers, practitioners, and
policymakers to systematically assess and enhance the inclusivity of AI
systems, paving the way for more equitable and responsible AI technologies.

TL;DR: 提出T-CPDL框架，结合时间、因果和概率逻辑，提升语言模型的结构化推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在时间约束、因果关系和概率推理方面的不足。

Method: 扩展传统描述逻辑，加入时间区间算子、显式因果关系和概率标注，提出两种T-CPDL变体。

Result: 实验证明T-CPDL显著提高了推理准确性、可解释性和置信度校准。

Conclusion: T-CPDL增强了语言模型的透明推理能力，为Logic-RAG框架奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large language models excel at generating fluent text but frequently struggle
with structured reasoning involving temporal constraints, causal relationships,
and probabilistic reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose Temporal
Causal Probabilistic Description Logic (T-CPDL), an integrated framework that
extends traditional Description Logic with temporal interval operators,
explicit causal relationships, and probabilistic annotations. We present two
distinct variants of T-CPDL: one capturing qualitative temporal relationships
through Allen's interval algebra, and another variant enriched with explicit
timestamped causal assertions. Both variants share a unified logical structure,
enabling complex reasoning tasks ranging from simple temporal ordering to
nuanced probabilistic causation. Empirical evaluations on temporal reasoning
and causal inference benchmarks confirm that T-CPDL substantially improves
inference accuracy, interpretability, and confidence calibration of language
model outputs. By delivering transparent reasoning paths and fine-grained
temporal and causal semantics, T-CPDL significantly enhances the capability of
language models to support robust, explainable, and trustworthy
decision-making. This work also lays the groundwork for developing advanced
Logic-Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Logic-RAG) frameworks, potentially
boosting the reasoning capabilities and efficiency of knowledge graph-enhanced
RAG systems.

Conclusion: Airalogy平台通过平衡通用性与标准化，有望推动多学科AI驱动的科学进步。

Abstract: Research data are the foundation of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven
science, yet current AI applications remain limited to a few fields with
readily available, well-structured, digitized datasets. Achieving comprehensive
AI empowerment across multiple disciplines is still out of reach. Present-day
research data collection is often fragmented, lacking unified standards,
inefficiently managed, and difficult to share. Creating a single platform for
standardized data digitization needs to overcome the inherent challenge of
balancing between universality (supporting the diverse, ever-evolving needs of
various disciplines) and standardization (enforcing consistent formats to fully
enable AI). No existing platform accommodates both facets. Building a truly
multidisciplinary platform requires integrating scientific domain knowledge
with sophisticated computing skills. Researchers often lack the computational
expertise to design customized and standardized data recording methods, whereas
platform developers rarely grasp the intricate needs of multiple scientific
domains. These gaps impede research data standardization and hamper AI-driven
progress. In this study, we address these challenges by developing Airalogy
(https://airalogy.com), the world's first AI- and community-driven platform
that balances universality and standardization for digitizing research data
across multiple disciplines. Airalogy represents entire research workflows
using customizable, standardized data records and offers an advanced AI
research copilot for intelligent Q&A, automated data entry, analysis, and
research automation. Already deployed in laboratories across all four schools
of Westlake University, Airalogy has the potential to accelerate and automate
scientific innovation in universities, industry, and the global research
community-ultimately benefiting humanity as a whole.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在RAG设置中产生幻觉的问题，提升模型可靠性。

Method: 提出AggTruth方法，通过分析上下文注意力分数分布检测幻觉，包含四种变体。

Result: 在不同任务中表现稳定，优于现有方法，且注意力头选择对性能至关重要。

Conclusion: AggTruth能有效检测LLM幻觉，注意力头选择是关键。

Abstract: In real-world applications, Large Language Models (LLMs) often hallucinate,
even in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) settings, which poses a
significant challenge to their deployment. In this paper, we introduce
AggTruth, a method for online detection of contextual hallucinations by
analyzing the distribution of internal attention scores in the provided context
(passage). Specifically, we propose four different variants of the method, each
varying in the aggregation technique used to calculate attention scores. Across
all LLMs examined, AggTruth demonstrated stable performance in both same-task
and cross-task setups, outperforming the current SOTA in multiple scenarios.
Furthermore, we conducted an in-depth analysis of feature selection techniques
and examined how the number of selected attention heads impacts detection
performance, demonstrating that careful selection of heads is essential to
achieve optimal results.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DLBC的新方法，用于在MARL中动态调节组内和组间的行为一致性，以提升协作和任务分工。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注组内行为一致性，而忽略了组间行为一致性的重要性，DLBC旨在填补这一空白。

Method: DLBC将智能体分组，动态调节组内和组间的行为多样性，通过约束策略函数实现广泛适用性。

Result: 实验表明，DLBC显著提升了组内协作和组间任务分工，性能大幅提升。

Conclusion: DLBC为多智能体系统行为一致性控制提供了新思路，未来可探索更复杂任务中的应用。

Abstract: Behavioral diversity in Multi-agent reinforcement learning(MARL) represents
an emerging and promising research area. Prior work has largely centered on
intra-group behavioral consistency in multi-agent systems, with limited
attention given to behavioral consistency in multi-agent grouping scenarios. In
this paper, we introduce Dual-Level Behavioral Consistency (DLBC), a novel MARL
control method designed to explicitly regulate agent behaviors at both
intra-group and inter-group levels. DLBC partitions agents into distinct groups
and dynamically modulates behavioral diversity both within and between these
groups. By dynamically modulating behavioral diversity within and between these
groups, DLBC achieves enhanced division of labor through inter-group
consistency, which constrains behavioral strategies across different groups.
Simultaneously, intra-group consistency, achieved by aligning behavioral
strategies within each group, fosters stronger intra-group cooperation.
Crucially, DLBC's direct constraint of agent policy functions ensures its broad
applicability across various algorithmic frameworks. Experimental results in
various grouping cooperation scenarios demonstrate that DLBC significantly
enhances both intra-group cooperative performance and inter-group task
specialization, yielding substantial performance improvements. DLBC provides
new ideas for behavioral consistency control of multi-intelligent body systems,
and its potential for application in more complex tasks and dynamic
environments can be further explored in the future.

TL;DR: 论文提出Programming by Backprop（PBB）作为大语言模型（LLMs）通过源代码训练增强推理能力的潜在机制，并验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs通过源代码训练提升推理能力的机制，尤其是无需输入输出示例（I/O）时的表现。

Method: 通过微调LLMs在两组程序（带I/O和不带I/O）上进行实验，比较其表现。

Result: 发现PBB在源代码形式下表现更优，且LLMs能通过隐式评估程序生成输出，链式思考（chain-of-thought）进一步提升了可靠性。

Conclusion: 源代码训练使LLMs内化可重用算法抽象，未来研究可进一步优化符号化过程学习。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) on source code significantly enhances
their general-purpose reasoning abilities, but the mechanisms underlying this
generalisation are poorly understood. In this paper, we propose Programming by
Backprop (PBB) as a potential driver of this effect - teaching a model to
evaluate a program for inputs by training on its source code alone, without
ever seeing I/O examples. To explore this idea, we finetune LLMs on two sets of
programs representing simple maths problems and algorithms: one with source
code and I/O examples (w/ IO), the other with source code only (w/o IO). We
find evidence that LLMs have some ability to evaluate w/o IO programs for
inputs in a range of experimental settings, and make several observations.
Firstly, PBB works significantly better when programs are provided as code
rather than semantically equivalent language descriptions. Secondly, LLMs can
produce outputs for w/o IO programs directly, by implicitly evaluating the
program within the forward pass, and more reliably when stepping through the
program in-context via chain-of-thought. We further show that PBB leads to more
robust evaluation of programs across inputs than training on I/O pairs drawn
from a distribution that mirrors naturally occurring data. Our findings suggest
a mechanism for enhanced reasoning through code training: it allows LLMs to
internalise reusable algorithmic abstractions. Significant scope remains for
future work to enable LLMs to more effectively learn from symbolic procedures,
and progress in this direction opens other avenues like model alignment by
training on formal constitutional principles.

Abstract: TRIZ, the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving, is a structured,
knowledge-based framework for innovation and abstracting problems to find
inventive solutions. However, its application is often limited by the
complexity and deep interdisciplinary knowledge required. Advancements in Large
Language Models (LLMs) have revealed new possibilities for automating parts of
this process. While previous studies have explored single LLMs in TRIZ
applications, this paper introduces a multi-agent approach. We propose an
LLM-based multi-agent system, called TRIZ agents, each with specialized
capabilities and tool access, collaboratively solving inventive problems based
on the TRIZ methodology. This multi-agent system leverages agents with various
domain expertise to efficiently navigate TRIZ steps. The aim is to model and
simulate an inventive process with language agents. We assess the effectiveness
of this team of agents in addressing complex innovation challenges based on a
selected case study in engineering. We demonstrate the potential of agent
collaboration to produce diverse, inventive solutions. This research
contributes to the future of AI-driven innovation, showcasing the advantages of
decentralized problem-solving in complex ideation tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出ConciseHint框架，通过注入文本提示在推理过程中鼓励模型生成简洁推理，同时自适应调整提示强度以保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型推理模型（LRMs）倾向于生成冗长推理过程，导致效率问题，而现有方法忽略了在生成过程中直接干预的潜力。

Method: 提出ConciseHint框架，在推理过程中注入文本提示（手动设计或基于简洁数据训练），并自适应调整提示强度。

Result: 在DeepSeek-R1和Qwen-3等模型上实验，推理长度减少65%（GSM8K基准），且几乎无准确率损失。

Conclusion: ConciseHint能有效生成简洁推理过程，同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) like DeepSeek-R1 and
OpenAI o1 series have achieved notable performance enhancements on complex
reasoning tasks by scaling up the generation length by Chain-of-Thought (CoT).
However, an emerging issue is their inclination to produce excessively verbose
reasoning processes, leading to the inefficiency problem. Existing literature
on improving efficiency mainly adheres to the before-reasoning paradigms such
as prompting and reasoning or fine-tuning and reasoning, but ignores the
promising direction of directly encouraging the model to speak concisely by
intervening during the generation of reasoning. In order to fill the blank, we
propose a framework dubbed ConciseHint, which continuously encourages the
reasoning model to speak concisely by injecting the textual hint (manually
designed or trained on the concise data) during the token generation of the
reasoning process. Besides, ConciseHint is adaptive to the complexity of the
query by adaptively adjusting the hint intensity, which ensures it will not
undermine model performance. Experiments on the state-of-the-art LRMs,
including DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen-3 series, demonstrate that our method can
effectively produce concise reasoning processes while maintaining performance
well. For instance, we achieve a reduction ratio of 65\% for the reasoning
length on GSM8K benchmark with Qwen-3 4B with nearly no accuracy loss.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何通过激活语言模型中的潜在子空间，实现对科学代码生成中编程语言选择的精确控制。

Method: 开发了梯度优化的自适应激活框架（G-ACT），通过聚类每提示激活差异并训练轻量级层探针，选择适当的导向向量。

Result: 在LLaMA-3.2 3B模型中，G-ACT将平均探针分类准确率提高了15%，早期层（0-6）的准确率提高了61.5%。

Conclusion: G-ACT提供了一种可扩展、可解释且高效的机制，适用于实际代理系统的概念级控制。

Abstract: This work examines whether activating latent subspaces in language models
(LLMs) can steer scientific code generation toward a specific programming
language. Five causal LLMs were first evaluated on scientific coding prompts to
quantify their baseline bias among four programming languages. A static
neuron-attribution method, perturbing the highest activated MLP weight for a
C++ or CPP token, proved brittle and exhibited limited generalization across
prompt styles and model scales. To address these limitations, a
gradient-refined adaptive activation steering framework (G-ACT) was developed:
per-prompt activation differences are clustered into a small set of steering
directions, and lightweight per-layer probes are trained and refined online to
select the appropriate steering vector. In LLaMA-3.2 3B, this approach reliably
biases generation towards the CPP language by increasing the average probe
classification accuracy by 15% and the early layers (0-6) improving the probe
classification accuracy by 61.5% compared to the standard ACT framework. For
LLaMA-3.3 70B, where attention-head signals become more diffuse, targeted
injections at key layers still improve language selection. Although per-layer
probing introduces a modest inference overhead, it remains practical by
steering only a subset of layers and enables reproducible model behavior. These
results demonstrate a scalable, interpretable and efficient mechanism for
concept-level control for practical agentic systems.
