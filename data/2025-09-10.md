### [1] [CellPainTR: Generalizable Representation Learning for Cross-Dataset Cell Painting Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06986)
*Cedric Caruzzo,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CellPainTR是一个基于Transformer的架构，用于学习对批次效应具有鲁棒性的细胞形态基础表示，能够在无需微调的情况下有效泛化到未见数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模生物发现需要整合海量异构数据集，但技术批次效应和缺乏可泛化模型是关键障碍。

Method: 采用Transformer架构，设计源特定上下文标记，实现无需重新训练即可有效进行分布外泛化。

Result: 在JUMP数据集上优于ComBat和Harmony等现有方法，在未见Bray数据集上保持高性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了创建真正基础模型的重要一步，可实现更可靠和可扩展的跨研究生物分析。

Abstract: Large-scale biological discovery requires integrating massive, heterogeneous
datasets like those from the JUMP Cell Painting consortium, but technical batch
effects and a lack of generalizable models remain critical roadblocks. To
address this, we introduce CellPainTR, a Transformer-based architecture
designed to learn foundational representations of cellular morphology that are
robust to batch effects. Unlike traditional methods that require retraining on
new data, CellPainTR's design, featuring source-specific context tokens, allows
for effective out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization to entirely unseen
datasets without fine-tuning. We validate CellPainTR on the large-scale JUMP
dataset, where it outperforms established methods like ComBat and Harmony in
both batch integration and biological signal preservation. Critically, we
demonstrate its robustness through a challenging OOD task on the unseen Bray et
al. dataset, where it maintains high performance despite significant domain and
feature shifts. Our work represents a significant step towards creating truly
foundational models for image-based profiling, enabling more reliable and
scalable cross-study biological analysis.

### [2] [FusWay: Multimodal hybrid fusion approach. Application to Railway Defect Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06987)
*Alexey Zhukov,Jenny Benois-Pineau,Amira Youssef,Akka Zemmari,Mohamed Mosbah,Virginie Taillandier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于YOLO和Vision Transformer的多模态融合架构，结合图像和音频信息进行铁路缺陷检测，相比单模态方法精度提升0.2个点


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单模态检测方法在铁路结构元素检测中存在过度检测问题，特别是当缺陷外观与正常结构元素相似时，需要多模态信息来提高检测精度

Method: 使用YOLOv8n进行快速目标检测，结合Vision Transformer融合图像多层级特征（第7、16、19层）和音频表征，针对铁路断裂和表面缺陷两类缺陷进行音像融合

Result: 在真实铁路数据集上实验表明，多模态融合相比纯视觉方法精度和整体准确率提升0.2个点，t检验证实差异具有统计显著性

Conclusion: 提出的多模态融合架构能有效提升铁路缺陷检测性能，证明了音频信息在视觉检测任务中的补充价值

Abstract: Multimodal fusion is a multimedia technique that has become popular in the
wide range of tasks where image information is accompanied by a signal/audio.
The latter may not convey highly semantic information, such as speech or music,
but some measures such as audio signal recorded by mics in the goal to detect
rail structure elements or defects. While classical detection approaches such
as You Only Look Once (YOLO) family detectors can be efficiently deployed for
defect detection on the image modality, the single modality approaches remain
limited. They yield an overdetection in case of the appearance similar to
normal structural elements. The paper proposes a new multimodal fusion
architecture built on the basis of domain rules with YOLO and Vision
transformer backbones. It integrates YOLOv8n for rapid object detection with a
Vision Transformer (ViT) to combine feature maps extracted from multiple layers
(7, 16, and 19) and synthesised audio representations for two defect classes:
rail Rupture and Surface defect. Fusion is performed between audio and image.
Experimental evaluation on a real-world railway dataset demonstrates that our
multimodal fusion improves precision and overall accuracy by 0.2 points
compared to the vision-only approach. Student's unpaired t-test also confirms
statistical significance of differences in the mean accuracy.

### [3] [Frustratingly Easy Feature Reconstruction for Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06988)
*Yingsheng Wang,Shuo Lu,Jian Liang,Aihua Zheng,Ran He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练数据的后处理OOD检测方法ClaFR，通过分类器权重的正交分解提取类已知子空间，计算特征重构误差来实现OOD检测，在多个基准测试中达到领先性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于特征的后处理方法需要访问训练数据，这在数据隐私保护场景下不适用。需要开发不依赖训练数据的OOD检测方法。

Method: ClaFR方法：1）对分类器权重进行正交分解提取类已知子空间；2）将原始特征映射到该子空间获得新表示；3）计算子空间内的特征重构误差作为OOD分数。

Result: 在多个OOD基准测试中取得了领先性能，且不需要访问训练数据。

Conclusion: ClaFR是一种简单有效的后处理OOD检测方法，解决了数据隐私场景下的限制，性能优越。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection helps models identify data outside the
training categories, crucial for security applications. While feature-based
post-hoc methods address this by evaluating data differences in the feature
space without changing network parameters, they often require access to
training data, which may not be suitable for some data privacy scenarios. This
may not be suitable in scenarios where data privacy protection is a concern. In
this paper, we propose a simple yet effective post-hoc method, termed
Classifier-based Feature Reconstruction (ClaFR), from the perspective of
subspace projection. It first performs an orthogonal decomposition of the
classifier's weights to extract the class-known subspace, then maps the
original data features into this subspace to obtain new data representations.
Subsequently, the OOD score is determined by calculating the feature
reconstruction error of the data within the subspace. Compared to existing OOD
detection algorithms, our method does not require access to training data while
achieving leading performance on multiple OOD benchmarks. Our code is released
at https://github.com/Aie0923/ClaFR.

### [4] [DIET-CP: Lightweight and Data Efficient Self Supervised Continued Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06990)
*Bryan Rodas,Natalie Montesino,Jakob Ambsdorf,David Klindt,Randall Balestriero*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DIET-CP是一种简单的持续预训练策略，能够在小型数据集上有效调整基础模型到新领域，无需标签和额外超参数


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在专业领域中，可用数据集通常很小，限制了SSL方法的适用性，且预训练模型通常只发布骨干权重，缺乏继续预训练的重要信息

Method: 提出DIET-CP策略，使用简单的目标函数，无需标签，不引入比监督微调更多的超参数，可以引导任何强大的基础模型适应新的数据分布

Result: 该方法在不同数据模态和骨干网络选择上表现稳定，仅使用1000张图像就能为DINOv3等最先进模型带来显著性能提升

Conclusion: DIET-CP为小规模专业领域数据集的持续预训练提供了简单有效的解决方案

Abstract: Continued pretraining offers a promising solution for adapting foundation
models to a new target domain. However, in specialized domains, available
datasets are often very small, limiting the applicability of SSL methods
developed for large-scale pretraining and making hyperparameter search
infeasible. In addition, pretrained models are usually released as
backbone-weights only, lacking important information to continue pretraining.
We propose to bridge this gap with DIET-CP, a simple continued pretraining
strategy, where any strong foundation model can be steered towards the new data
distribution of interest. DIET-CP relies on a very simple objective, requires
no labels, and introduces no more hyperparameters than supervised finetuning.
It is stable across data modalities and backbone choices, while providing a
significant performance boost for state-of-the-art models such as DINOv3 using
only 1000 images.

### [5] [FedAPT: Federated Adversarial Prompt Tuning for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06992)
*Kun Zhai,Siheng Chen,Xingjun Ma,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedAPT是一种联邦对抗提示调优方法，通过类别感知提示生成器和跨层生成器共享策略，解决非IID设置下的类别信息差距问题，显著提升联邦提示调优的对抗鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦提示调优(FPT)方法虽然高效，但存在对抗攻击脆弱性，特别是在非IID设置下存在客户端与全局模型之间的类别信息差距问题。

Method: 提出类别感知提示生成器，利用全局标签嵌入作为引导生成视觉提示；采用跨层生成器共享策略增强不同层间的提示耦合。

Result: 在多个图像分类数据集上，FedAPT显著优于现有方法，在对抗鲁棒性方面表现优异，并在跨域和跨数据集场景中展现出卓越的泛化能力。

Conclusion: FedAPT有效解决了联邦提示调优中的对抗鲁棒性问题，具有实际应用价值，特别是在非IID数据分布的现实场景中。

Abstract: Federated Prompt Tuning (FPT) is an efficient method for cross-client
collaborative fine-tuning of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However,
models tuned using FPT are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, leading to
misclassification in downstream tasks. In this work, we introduce Federated
Adversarial Prompt Tuning (\textbf{FedAPT}), a novel method designed to enhance
the adversarial robustness of FPT. We identify a key issue in FedAPT under
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) settings: a \textit{class
information gap} between clients and the global model. Clients rely solely on
limited local label information to generate adversarial samples for training,
while the global model must defend against adversarial attacks from global
labels. To address this issue, we propose a \textbf{class-aware prompt
generator} that generates visual prompts from text prompts. This generator is
guided by a \emph{Global Label Embedding} (serving as a ``beacon") which
encodes cross-client label information to create more globally-aligned visual
prompts. Additionally, we propose a \textbf{cross-layer generator sharing}
strategy to enhance prompt coupling across different layers of the model,
further boosting adversarial robustness. Extensive experiments on multiple
image classification datasets demonstrate the superiority of FedAPT in
improving adversarial robustness, outperforming existing methods by a large
margin. FedAPT also exhibits exceptional generalization in cross-domain and
cross-dataset scenarios, indicating its effectiveness in real-world
applications.

### [7] [VLMs-in-the-Wild: Bridging the Gap Between Academic Benchmarks and Enterprise Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06994)
*Srihari Bandraupalli,Anupam Purwar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViLD框架填补了学术评估与企业部署需求之间的差距，通过10个关键业务任务评估视觉语言模型，并提出了创新的BlockWeaver算法来比较OCR输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于选择题和合成数据的基准测试无法捕捉真实企业应用的复杂性，如社交媒体内容分析，需要更贴近实际部署需求的评估框架。

Method: 开发ViLD框架，定义10个业务关键任务，提出BlockWeaver算法比较无序OCR输出，构建包含7500个真实样本的基准数据集，结合语义匹配、传统指标和新方法进行评估。

Result: 通过评估领先开源VLM模型（Qwen、MIMO、InternVL）与专有基线的对比，提供了首个基于行业实际任务的VLM能力评估。

Conclusion: ViLD框架为企业环境中VLM的部署提供了可操作的见解，填补了学术评估与企业需求之间的重要空白。

Abstract: Open-source Vision-Language Models show immense promise for enterprise
applications, yet a critical disconnect exists between academic evaluation and
enterprise deployment requirements. Current benchmarks rely heavily on
multiple-choice questions and synthetic data, failing to capture the complexity
of real-world business applications like social media content analysis. This
paper introduces VLM-in-the-Wild (ViLD), a comprehensive framework to bridge
this gap by evaluating VLMs on operational enterprise requirements. We define
ten business-critical tasks: logo detection, OCR, object detection, human
presence and demographic analysis, human activity and appearance analysis,
scene detection, camera perspective and media quality assessment, dominant
colors, comprehensive description, and NSFW detection. To this framework, we
bring an innovative BlockWeaver Algorithm that solves the challenging problem
of comparing unordered, variably-grouped OCR outputs from VLMs without relying
on embeddings or LLMs, achieving remarkable speed and reliability. To
demonstrate efficacy of ViLD, we constructed a new benchmark dataset of 7,500
diverse samples, carefully stratified from a corpus of one million real-world
images and videos. ViLD provides actionable insights by combining semantic
matching (both embedding-based and LLM-as-a-judge approaches), traditional
metrics, and novel methods to measure the completeness and faithfulness of
descriptive outputs. By benchmarking leading open-source VLMs (Qwen, MIMO, and
InternVL) against a powerful proprietary baseline as per ViLD framework, we
provide one of the first industry-grounded, task-driven assessment of VLMs
capabilities, offering actionable insights for their deployment in enterprise
environments.

### [8] [The Protocol Genome A Self Supervised Learning Framework from DICOM Headers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06995)
*Jimmy Joseph*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Protocol Genome是一个自监督学习系统，通过分析DICOM头部数据学习协议相关性，在外部验证中达到AUROC 0.901（基准0.847）和ECE 0.036（基准0.058），提高了跨模态和厂商的校准性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床影像通过PACS/DICOM系统处理，扫描协议选择（扫描仪型号、序列、参数等）会影响图像对比度、噪声和伪影，这些潜在混杂因素阻碍了纯图像网络在不同站点间的泛化能力。

Method: 将结构化DICOM头部作为标签，通过三种方式学习协议感知但临床鲁棒的图像表示：(1)协议-图像对比学习，(2)掩码协议预测，(3)协议-协议转换。使用126万项研究数据（7个医疗系统，31台扫描仪，3个厂商）。

Result: 在三个临床任务上表现优异：肺栓塞胸部CT分诊（+0.046 AUROC）、脑胶质瘤MRI分级（+0.058 AUROC）、心胸比异常检测（+0.041 AUROC），获得25-37%的校准改进（p < 0.01）。使用10-20%标注数据仍能保持优势。

Conclusion: Protocol Genome能减少协议边界处的假阳性，适用于PACS系统，提供了模型卡片和部署指南，包括去标识化和偏倚审计，为临床影像分析提供了更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Protocol Genome, a self-supervised learning
system that learns correlations from DICOM headers and achieves AUROC 0.901 (vs
0.847 baseline) and ECE 0.036 (vs 0.058) on fully held-out external validation.
Our method also improves calibration and robustness across modalities (CT, MRI,
CXR) and vendors. Clinical imaging is funneled through PACS/DICOM, where
procedure choices (scanner make/model, sequence, kernel, kVp, TR/TE, and slice
thickness) have consequences for contrast, noise, and artifact. These latent
confounders impede the generalization of image-only networks across sites. We
consider structured DICOM headers as a label and learn protocol-aware but
clinically robust image representations. Protocol Genome obtains tokenized
embeddings of de-identified header fields and models them along with image
features using: (1) protocol-image contrastive learning, (2) masked protocol
prediction, and (3) protocol-protocol translation. With 1.26M studies (7 health
systems, 31 scanners, 3 vendors; CT, MR, CR/DR), we experiment on: (A) chest CT
triage for PE, (B) brain MRI glioma grading, and (C) chest radiograph
cardiomegaly detection. Relative to strong SSL baselines (SimCLR, MAE) as well
as ImageNet transfer, Protocol Genome (+0.046: PE, +0.058: glioma, +0.041:
cardiomegaly) is associated with higher external AUROC; 25-37% calibration
improvements are obtained (p < 0.01, DeLong tests). While the gains may be
task-dependent, they are preserved with 10-20% of labeled data. From a clinical
point of view, the technique reduces false positives at protocol borders and is
applicable in a PACS (DICOM C-FIND/C-MOVE, DICOMweb QIDO/WADO). We publish a
model card and deployment guide, complete with both de-identification and bias
audits.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 视觉语言模型在文字突变情况下识别能力不如人类，显示出结构性限制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究高级视觉语言模型是否像人类一样具备对文字突变的弹性识别能力

Method: 构建中文象形文字和英语字母词汇的心理物理受测量，通过切割、重组和叠加字形创造"可见但不可读"的刺激物

Result: 当代VLMs在这些干扰下表现严重下降，经常产生无关或不连贯输出，显示结构性限制

Conclusion: 需要编码符号分割、组合和绑定的架构和训练策略，以提升多模态系统在教育、无障碍等领域的应用

Abstract: Writing is a universal cultural technology that reuses vision for symbolic
communication. Humans display striking resilience: we readily recognize words
even when characters are fragmented, fused, or partially occluded. This paper
investigates whether advanced vision language models (VLMs) share this
resilience. We construct two psychophysics inspired benchmarks across distinct
writing systems, Chinese logographs and English alphabetic words, by splicing,
recombining, and overlaying glyphs to yield ''visible but unreadable'' stimuli
for models while remaining legible to humans. Despite strong performance on
clean text, contemporary VLMs show a severe drop under these perturbations,
frequently producing unrelated or incoherent outputs. The pattern suggests a
structural limitation: models heavily leverage generic visual invariances but
under rely on compositional priors needed for robust literacy. We release
stimuli generation code, prompts, and evaluation protocols to facilitate
transparent replication and follow up work. Our findings motivate architectures
and training strategies that encode symbol segmentation, composition, and
binding across scripts, and they delineate concrete challenges for deploying
multimodal systems in education, accessibility, cultural heritage, and
security.

*Guan Yu,Zhang Jianhua,Liang Dong,Liu Qiegen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过频域特征学习和时间融合策略生成k空间数据，解决动态心脏MRI数据稀缺问题，在极稀缺数据情况下仍能稳定生成高质量k空间数据


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态心脏MRI拍摄因其动态性和复杂性，很难获得高质量、多样化的k空间数据，影响了动态心脏MRI的稳健重建

Method: 在频域进行特征层面学习，利用傅里叶变换的全局表征能力，将频域作为全局特征空间；采用时间融合策略作为生成指导，整合不同时间框的k空间数据

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在低数据情况下体现出强大的生成能力

Conclusion: 该方法具有实用潜力，可以有效缓解动态MRI重建中的数据稀缺问题

Abstract: Owing to the inherently dynamic and complex characteristics of cardiac
magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, high-quality and diverse k-space data are
rarely available in practice, which in turn hampers robust reconstruction of
dynamic cardiac MRI. To address this challenge, we perform feature-level
learning directly in the frequency domain and employ a temporal-fusion strategy
as the generative guidance to synthesize k-space data. Specifically, leveraging
the global representation capacity of the Fourier transform, the frequency
domain can be considered a natural global feature space. Therefore, unlike
traditional methods that use pixel-level convolution for feature learning and
modeling in the image domain, this letter focuses on feature-level modeling in
the frequency domain, enabling stable and rich generation even with ultra
low-data regimes. Moreover, leveraging the advantages of feature-level modeling
in the frequency domain, we integrate k-space data across time frames with
multiple fusion strategies to steer and further optimize the generative
trajectory. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method possesses
strong generative ability in low-data regimes, indicating practical potential
to alleviate data scarcity in dynamic MRI reconstruction.

*Liviu Nicolae Fircă,Antonio Bărbălau,Dan Oneata,Elena Burceanu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文首次明确评估模型在语义和感知上差异较大的类别间的属性知识过渡能力，发现模型表现随着训练测试集相关性减弱而冲击性下降


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估模型能否在语义和感知差异较大的类别间过渡属性知识，比如识别"有四条腿"属性同时应用于"狗"和"椅子"

Method: 通过LLM驱动语义分组、嵌入相似度阈值、嵌入聚类和超类分区等方法构建训练测试集分割策略，逐渐减少训练测试集间的相关性

Result: 随着训练测试集相关性减弱，模型性能冲击性下降；聚类方法在减少隐藏相关性和保持可学习性方面表现最佳

Conclusion: 当前表示学习方法对分割设计敏感，在跨语义属性推理方面有限制，为未来评测标准构建提供了见解

Abstract: Can models generalize attribute knowledge across semantically and
perceptually dissimilar categories? While prior work has addressed attribute
prediction within narrow taxonomic or visually similar domains, it remains
unclear whether current models can abstract attributes and apply them to
conceptually distant categories. This work presents the first explicit
evaluation for the robustness of the attribute prediction task under such
conditions, testing whether models can correctly infer shared attributes
between unrelated object types: e.g., identifying that the attribute "has four
legs" is common to both "dogs" and "chairs". To enable this evaluation, we
introduce train-test split strategies that progressively reduce correlation
between training and test sets, based on: LLM-driven semantic grouping,
embedding similarity thresholding, embedding-based clustering, and
supercategory-based partitioning using ground-truth labels. Results show a
sharp drop in performance as the correlation between training and test
categories decreases, indicating strong sensitivity to split design. Among the
evaluated methods, clustering yields the most effective trade-off, reducing
hidden correlations while preserving learnability. These findings offer new
insights into the limitations of current representations and inform future
benchmark construction for attribute reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出了一个人类参与循环的定量评估框架，用于评估LLM生成的3D模型，通过多模态输入比较生成质量，发现代码级提示能实现完美重建


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏评估LLM生成3D模型几何和结构保真度的稳健方法，需要开发定量评估框架来支持CAD设计民主化、逆向工程和快速原型等应用

Method: 提出了一套全面的相似性和复杂性度量指标（体积精度、表面对齐、尺寸保真度、拓扑复杂性），使用L型支架组件作为案例研究，比较四种输入模态（2D正交视图、等距草图、几何结构树、代码修正提示）下的LLM性能

Result: 研究发现语义丰富度增加能提高生成保真度，代码级提示在所有度量指标上实现了完美重建，定量评估方法相比传统定性方法能显著加快向真实值的收敛速度

Conclusion: 该工作不仅推进了对AI辅助形状合成的理解，还为验证和优化生成模型提供了可扩展的方法论，适用于各种CAD应用

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly capable of interpreting multimodal
inputs to generate complex 3D shapes, yet robust methods to evaluate geometric
and structural fidelity remain underdeveloped. This paper introduces a human in
the loop framework for the quantitative evaluation of LLM generated 3D models,
supporting applications such as democratization of CAD design, reverse
engineering of legacy designs, and rapid prototyping. We propose a
comprehensive suite of similarity and complexity metrics, including volumetric
accuracy, surface alignment, dimensional fidelity, and topological intricacy,
to benchmark generated models against ground truth CAD references. Using an L
bracket component as a case study, we systematically compare LLM performance
across four input modalities: 2D orthographic views, isometric sketches,
geometric structure trees, and code based correction prompts. Our findings
demonstrate improved generation fidelity with increased semantic richness, with
code level prompts achieving perfect reconstruction across all metrics. A key
contribution of this work is demonstrating that our proposed quantitative
evaluation approach enables significantly faster convergence toward the ground
truth, especially compared to traditional qualitative methods based solely on
visual inspection and human intuition. This work not only advances the
understanding of AI assisted shape synthesis but also provides a scalable
methodology to validate and refine generative models for diverse CAD
applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MEGS²是一个内存高效的3D高斯泼溅框架，通过联合优化基元数量和每个基元的参数，实现了前所未有的内存压缩，在保持渲染质量的同时显著降低显存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅技术虽然在新视角合成中表现出色，但其高内存消耗限制了在边缘设备上的应用。现有压缩方法大多只关注存储压缩，未能解决渲染内存的关键瓶颈问题。

Method: 提出MEGS²框架：1）用轻量级的任意方向球面高斯瓣替代内存密集的球谐函数作为颜色表示；2）提出统一的软剪枝框架，将基元数量和瓣数剪枝建模为单一约束优化问题。

Result: 实验显示MEGS²相比现有方法实现了50%的静态显存减少和40%的渲染显存减少，同时保持了相当的渲染质量。

Conclusion: MEGS²通过联合优化基元数量和参数表示，有效解决了3D高斯泼溅的内存瓶颈问题，为边缘设备部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a dominant novel-view synthesis
technique, but its high memory consumption severely limits its applicability on
edge devices. A growing number of 3DGS compression methods have been proposed
to make 3DGS more efficient, yet most only focus on storage compression and
fail to address the critical bottleneck of rendering memory. To address this
problem, we introduce MEGS$^{2}$, a novel memory-efficient framework that
tackles this challenge by jointly optimizing two key factors: the total
primitive number and the parameters per primitive, achieving unprecedented
memory compression. Specifically, we replace the memory-intensive spherical
harmonics with lightweight arbitrarily-oriented spherical Gaussian lobes as our
color representations. More importantly, we propose a unified soft pruning
framework that models primitive-number and lobe-number pruning as a single
constrained optimization problem. Experiments show that MEGS$^{2}$ achieves a
50% static VRAM reduction and a 40% rendering VRAM reduction compared to
existing methods, while maintaining comparable rendering quality.

TL;DR: 通过空间域矩和频谱域功率谱的组合损失函数，推动文本生成图像模型的潜在空间向标准正态分布对齐，以支持下游任务优化


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在文本生成图像模型的潜在空间中进行有效的优化，需要一种能够使样本与标准正态分布对齐的正则化方法

Method: 将高维样本元素视为一维标准正态变量，设计组合损失函数（空间域矩正则化+频谱域功率谱正则化），通过随机排列保证排列不变性

Result: 新正则化方法在生成模型中超越以往正态性正则化，有效防止奖励欺骗，加快收敛速度，在美学评价和文本对齐任务上表现优异

Conclusion: 该统一框架为潜在空间优化提供了高效的正则化方法，能够统一解释现有正态性正则化方法，并在实际应用中表现出优异性能

Abstract: We propose a novel regularization loss that enforces standard Gaussianity,
encouraging samples to align with a standard Gaussian distribution. This
facilitates a range of downstream tasks involving optimization in the latent
space of text-to-image models. We treat elements of a high-dimensional sample
as one-dimensional standard Gaussian variables and define a composite loss that
combines moment-based regularization in the spatial domain with power
spectrum-based regularization in the spectral domain. Since the expected values
of moments and power spectrum distributions are analytically known, the loss
promotes conformity to these properties. To ensure permutation invariance, the
losses are applied to randomly permuted inputs. Notably, existing
Gaussianity-based regularizations fall within our unified framework: some
correspond to moment losses of specific orders, while the previous
covariance-matching loss is equivalent to our spectral loss but incurs higher
time complexity due to its spatial-domain computation. We showcase the
application of our regularization in generative modeling for test-time reward

text alignment. Our regularization outperforms previous Gaussianity
regularization, effectively prevents reward hacking and accelerates

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型如SAM存在大量不透明的调优参数，需要大量手动优化，限制了在实时流数据分析中的可用性

Method: 构建基于成像系统物理特性的奖励函数（如颗粒尺寸分布、几何形状等），通过奖励驱动的优化框架来微调SAM模型

Result: 开发了优化版本SAM*，提高了模型在多样化分割任务中的适应性和性能，特别适用于实时流数据分割

Conclusion: 奖励函数优化方法有效提升了基础分割模型在显微镜成像等需要精确分割的应用中的性能，实现了更好的实时分析能力

Abstract: Image segmentation is a critical task in microscopy, essential for accurately
analyzing and interpreting complex visual data. This task can be performed
using custom models trained on domain-specific datasets, transfer learning from
pre-trained models, or foundational models that offer broad applicability.
However, foundational models often present a considerable number of
non-transparent tuning parameters that require extensive manual optimization,
limiting their usability for real-time streaming data analysis. Here, we
introduce a reward function-based optimization to fine-tune foundational models
and illustrate this approach for SAM (Segment Anything Model) framework by
Meta. The reward functions can be constructed to represent the physics of the
imaged system, including particle size distributions, geometries, and other
criteria. By integrating a reward-driven optimization framework, we enhance
SAM's adaptability and performance, leading to an optimized variant, SAM$^{*}$,
that better aligns with the requirements of diverse segmentation tasks and
particularly allows for real-time streaming data segmentation. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of this approach in microscopy imaging, where precise
segmentation is crucial for analyzing cellular structures, material interfaces,
and nanoscale features.

*Juan Manuel Contreras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文介绍了Aymara图像公平性评估基准，用于评估AI生成图像中的社会偏见。研究发现大型多模态模型不仅复制而且放大了职业性别刻板印象，存在显著的默认男性偏见，且不同模型的偏见程度差异很大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究虽然识别了大型多模态模型中的性别偏见，但方法学限制阻碍了大规模、可比较的跨模型分析。需要开发标准化评估工具来促进AI开发的问责制和公平性。

Method: 使用75个程序生成的性别中性提示词，测试13个商业可用的大型多模态模型，生成刻板男性、刻板女性和非刻板职业的人物图像，然后使用经过验证的LLM-as-a-judge系统对965张结果图像进行性别代表性评分。

Result: 研究发现：1）LMMs系统性放大职业性别刻板印象；2）模型存在强烈的默认男性偏见；3）不同模型的偏见程度差异显著（46.7%到73.3%）。表现最佳的模型实现了接近性别平等的最高公平性得分。

Conclusion: 高度偏见并非不可避免的结果，而是设计选择的结果。这项工作提供了迄今为止最全面的跨模型性别偏见基准，强调了标准化自动化评估工具对于促进AI开发公平性的必要性。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have revolutionized text-to-image generation,
but they risk perpetuating the harmful social biases in their training data.
Prior work has identified gender bias in these models, but methodological
limitations prevented large-scale, comparable, cross-model analysis. To address
this gap, we introduce the Aymara Image Fairness Evaluation, a benchmark for
assessing social bias in AI-generated images. We test 13 commercially available
LMMs using 75 procedurally-generated, gender-neutral prompts to generate people
in stereotypically-male, stereotypically-female, and non-stereotypical
professions. We then use a validated LLM-as-a-judge system to score the 965
resulting images for gender representation. Our results reveal (p < .001 for
all): 1) LMMs systematically not only reproduce but actually amplify
occupational gender stereotypes relative to real-world labor data, generating
men in 93.0% of images for male-stereotyped professions but only 22.5% for
female-stereotyped professions; 2) Models exhibit a strong default-male bias,
generating men in 68.3% of the time for non-stereotyped professions; and 3) The
extent of bias varies dramatically across models, with overall male
representation ranging from 46.7% to 73.3%. Notably, the top-performing model
de-amplified gender stereotypes and approached gender parity, achieving the
highest fairness scores. This variation suggests high bias is not an inevitable
outcome but a consequence of design choices. Our work provides the most
comprehensive cross-model benchmark of gender bias to date and underscores the
necessity of standardized, automated evaluation tools for promoting
accountability and fairness in AI development.

TL;DR: 通过使用优化的块稀疏内核替换传统Transformer模型中的全局注意力机制，实现了多视图重建任务的高效推理，速度提升4倍以上保持相当性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Transformer基础的多视图重建模型（如VGGT和π^3）因全局注意力的平方复杂度导致的运行时急冲问题，提高大规模图像集的可扩展性。

Method: 通过对注意力矩阵进行实证分析，发现概率分布集中在少数跨视图几何匹配的patch交互上，从而提出使用高度优化的块稀疏内核替换密集全局注意操作。

Result: 在多视图测试集上评估显示，方法能够达到相当任务性能的同时，推理速度提升达4倍以上，而且无需重新训练基础模型。

Conclusion: 稀疏注意力机制是一种高效的替代方案，可以在保持多视图重建模型性能的同时显著提升计算效率，支持大规模图像集的处理。

Abstract: Efficient and accurate feed-forward multi-view reconstruction has long been
an important task in computer vision. Recent transformer-based models like VGGT
and $\pi^3$ have achieved impressive results with simple architectures, yet
they face an inherent runtime bottleneck, due to the quadratic complexity of
the global attention layers, that limits the scalability to large image sets.
In this paper, we empirically analyze the global attention matrix of these
models and observe that probability mass concentrates on a small subset of
patch-patch interactions that correspond to cross-view geometric matches.
Motivated by the structured attention and inspired by recent advancement in
large language models, we propose a replacement for the dense global attention
operation based on highly optimized block-sparse kernels, yielding up to
$4\times$ faster inference with comparable task performance. Our retrofit
requires no retraining of the backbone, extends to both VGGT and $\pi^3$, and
supports large image collections. Evaluations on a comprehensive suite of
multi-view benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对边缘服务器VIO系统中姿态欺骗攻击的无监督检测与恢复机制，通过攻击无关会话学习运动时序规律来检测运行时偏差并恢复姿态一致性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前将VIO卸载到边缘服务器的趋势导致服务器端存在威胁面，微小的姿态欺骗可能累积成显著漂移，同时规避启发式检查

Method: 在无攻击会话上训练模型学习运动时序规律，检测运行时偏差并启动恢复机制来恢复姿态一致性

Result: 在ILLIXR测试床上使用多种欺骗强度进行评估，实验结果显示在轨迹和姿态误差方面相比无防御基线有显著降低

Conclusion: 该无监督、无标签的检测恢复机制能有效应对VIO系统中的姿态欺骗攻击，提升系统安全性

Abstract: Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) supports immersive Virtual Reality (VR) by
fusing camera and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data for real-time pose.
However, current trend of offloading VIO to edge servers can lead server-side
threat surface where subtle pose spoofing can accumulate into substantial
drift, while evading heuristic checks. In this paper, we study this threat and
present an unsupervised, label-free detection and recovery mechanism. The
proposed model is trained on attack-free sessions to learn temporal
regularities of motion to detect runtime deviations and initiate recovery to
restore pose consistency. We evaluate the approach in a realistic offloaded-VIO
environment using ILLIXR testbed across multiple spoofing intensities.
Experimental results in terms of well-known performance metrics show
substantial reductions in trajectory and pose error compared to a no-defense
baseline.

Motivation: 研究假设面部增强技术在提升感知质量的同时会降低深度伪造检测器的性能，旨在系统评估这些技术是否具有反取证作用。

Method: 使用传统图像处理方法和先进的GAN增强技术，在FaceForensics++、DeepFakeDetection和CelebDF-v2数据集上评估朴素、空间和频域检测方法的鲁棒性，并进行对抗训练实验。

Result: 实验表明基础增强滤波器可显著降低检测准确率（ASR达64.63%），GAN技术进一步利用这些漏洞（ASR达75.12%）。

Conclusion: 面部增强方法能有效作为反取证工具，强调需要更具弹性和适应性的取证方法。

Abstract: Face enhancement techniques are widely used to enhance facial appearance.
However, they can inadvertently distort biometric features, leading to
significant decrease in the accuracy of deepfake detectors. This study
hypothesizes that these techniques, while improving perceptual quality, can
degrade the performance of deepfake detectors. To investigate this, we
systematically evaluate whether commonly used face enhancement methods can
serve an anti-forensic role by reducing detection accuracy. We use both
traditional image processing methods and advanced GAN-based enhancements to
evaluate the robustness of deepfake detectors. We provide a comprehensive
analysis of the effectiveness of these enhancement techniques, focusing on
their impact on Na\"ive, Spatial, and Frequency-based detection methods.
Furthermore, we conduct adversarial training experiments to assess whether
exposure to face enhancement transformations improves model robustness.
Experiments conducted on the FaceForensics++, DeepFakeDetection, and CelebDF-v2
datasets indicate that even basic enhancement filters can significantly reduce
detection accuracy achieving ASR up to 64.63\%. In contrast, GAN-based
techniques further exploit these vulnerabilities, achieving ASR up to 75.12\%.
Our results demonstrate that face enhancement methods can effectively function
as anti-forensic tools, emphasizing the need for more resilient and adaptive
forensic methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督学习需要大量标注数据，但在开放世界场景中可能出现新类别，现有方法主要关注半监督学习，本文探索完全无监督的新类别发现方法

Method: 使用Vision Transformer生成向量嵌入，通过注意力机制估计聚类数量，并整合流形学习技术利用数据内在几何结构来优化嵌入表示

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、ImageNet-100和Tiny ImageNet上实现了单模态聚类和新类别发现的state-of-the-art结果，无论聚类数量是否已知

Conclusion: 提出的完全无监督方法在图像聚类和新类别发现任务中表现出色，为开放世界学习提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Working with annotated data is the cornerstone of supervised learning.
Nevertheless, providing labels to instances is a task that requires significant
human effort. Several critical real-world applications make things more
complicated because no matter how many labels may have been identified in a
task of interest, it could be the case that examples corresponding to novel
classes may appear in the future. Not unsurprisingly, prior work in this,
so-called, `open-world' context has focused a lot on semi-supervised
approaches.
  Focusing on image classification, somehow paradoxically, we propose a fully
unsupervised approach to the problem of determining the novel categories in a
particular dataset. Our approach relies on estimating the number of clusters
using Vision Transformers, which utilize attention mechanisms to generate
vector embeddings. Furthermore, we incorporate manifold learning techniques to
refine these embeddings by exploiting the intrinsic geometry of the data,
thereby enhancing the overall image clustering performance. Overall, we
establish new State-of-the-Art results on single-modal clustering and Novel
Class Discovery on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, and Tiny ImageNet. We do
so, both when the number of clusters is known or unknown ahead of time. The

### [22] [XBusNet: Text-Guided Breast Ultrasound Segmentation via Multimodal Vision-Language Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07213)
*Raja Mallina,Bryar Shareef*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XBusNet是一种双提示双分支多模态模型，通过结合全局语义和局部边界精确性，在乳腺超声分割任务中实现了独到的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精确的乳腺超声分割对可靠测量和定量分析至关重要，但小或低对比度病变因模糊边缘和斑点噪声而难以分割。文本提示能添加临床上下文，但直接应用弱定位文本-56fe像符号容易产生粗糕的分割结果。

Method: 设计XBusNet双提示双分支多模态模型：全局路径基于CLIP Vision Transformer，编码整体图像语义；局部U-Net路径强调精确边界，通过描述形状、边缘和BI-RADS术语的提示进行调制。提示从结构化元数据自动组装，无需手动点击。

Result: 在BLU数据集上进行五折交叉验证，XBusNet实现独到的性能（Dice: 0.8765, IoU: 0.8149），超迈六个强基线。小病变显示最大收益，缺失区域和假阵之间激活更少。分离研究证明全局上下文、局部边界建模和提示调制的补充作用。

Conclusion: 双提示双分支多模态设计通过融合全局语义和局部精度，产生了准确的乳腺超声分割掩码，提高了小型低对比度病变的稳健性。

Abstract: Background: Precise breast ultrasound (BUS) segmentation supports reliable
measurement, quantitative analysis, and downstream classification, yet remains
difficult for small or low-contrast lesions with fuzzy margins and speckle
noise. Text prompts can add clinical context, but directly applying weakly
localized text-image cues (e.g., CAM/CLIP-derived signals) tends to produce
coarse, blob-like responses that smear boundaries unless additional mechanisms
recover fine edges. Methods: We propose XBusNet, a novel dual-prompt,
dual-branch multimodal model that combines image features with clinically
grounded text. A global pathway based on a CLIP Vision Transformer encodes
whole-image semantics conditioned on lesion size and location, while a local
U-Net pathway emphasizes precise boundaries and is modulated by prompts that
describe shape, margin, and Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS)
terms. Prompts are assembled automatically from structured metadata, requiring
no manual clicks. We evaluate on the Breast Lesions USG (BLU) dataset using
five-fold cross-validation. Primary metrics are Dice and Intersection over
Union (IoU); we also conduct size-stratified analyses and ablations to assess
the roles of the global and local paths and the text-driven modulation.
Results: XBusNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on BLU, with mean Dice
of 0.8765 and IoU of 0.8149, outperforming six strong baselines. Small lesions
show the largest gains, with fewer missed regions and fewer spurious
activations. Ablation studies show complementary contributions of global
context, local boundary modeling, and prompt-based modulation. Conclusions: A
dual-prompt, dual-branch multimodal design that merges global semantics with
local precision yields accurate BUS segmentation masks and improves robustness
for small, low-contrast lesions.

Conclusion: 高级生成模型与可解释特征的协同效应能够创建高精度医学诊断工具

Abstract: Data scarcity hinders deep learning for medical imaging. We propose a
framework for breast cancer classification in thermograms that addresses this
using a Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DPM) for data augmentation. Our
DPM-based augmentation is shown to be superior to both traditional methods and
a ProGAN baseline. The framework fuses deep features from a pre-trained
ResNet-50 with handcrafted nonlinear features (e.g., Fractal Dimension) derived
from U-Net segmented tumors. An XGBoost classifier trained on these fused
features achieves 98.0\% accuracy and 98.1\% sensitivity. Ablation studies and
statistical tests confirm that both the DPM augmentation and the nonlinear
feature fusion are critical, statistically significant components of this
success. This work validates the synergy between advanced generative models and
interpretable features for creating highly accurate medical diagnostic tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态模型训练依赖图像-文本对，但文本标注通常稀疏且缺乏细粒度视觉细节，导致理解与生成之间存在偏差

Method: 提出重建对齐(RecA)方法，利用模型自身的视觉理解嵌入作为条件，通过自监督重建损失优化图像重建，实现理解与生成的对齐

Result: 仅用27 GPU小时，在GenEval(0.73→0.90)和DPGBench(80.93→88.15)上显著提升生成性能，编辑基准也有明显改善(ImgEdit 3.38→3.75, GEdit 6.94→7.25)，超越更大开源模型

Conclusion: RecA是一种高效通用的后训练对齐策略，适用于多种UMM架构，能够有效弥合视觉理解与生成之间的差距

Abstract: Unified multimodal models (UMMs) unify visual understanding and generation
within a single architecture. However, conventional training relies on
image-text pairs (or sequences) whose captions are typically sparse and miss
fine-grained visual details--even when they use hundreds of words to describe a
simple image. We introduce Reconstruction Alignment (RecA), a
resource-efficient post-training method that leverages visual understanding
encoder embeddings as dense "text prompts," providing rich supervision without
captions. Concretely, RecA conditions a UMM on its own visual understanding
embeddings and optimizes it to reconstruct the input image with a
self-supervised reconstruction loss, thereby realigning understanding and
generation. Despite its simplicity, RecA is broadly applicable: across
autoregressive, masked-autoregressive, and diffusion-based UMMs, it
consistently improves generation and editing fidelity. With only 27 GPU-hours,
post-training with RecA substantially improves image generation performance on
GenEval (0.73$\rightarrow$0.90) and DPGBench (80.93$\rightarrow$88.15), while
also boosting editing benchmarks (ImgEdit 3.38$\rightarrow$3.75, GEdit
6.94$\rightarrow$7.25). Notably, RecA surpasses much larger open-source models
and applies broadly across diverse UMM architectures, establishing it as an
efficient and general post-training alignment strategy for UMMs

Method: 设计双域增强模块(DDE)包含跨尺度小波Mamba(CSWM)和傅里叶细节恢复块(FDR)来增强低光照图像；设计优先级引导Mamba融合模块(PGMF)通过优先级扫描从局部目标特征开始融合，减少冗余信息影响

Result: 在DroneVehicle和VEDAI数据集上的实验表明，DEPF在目标检测方面表现优异，优于最先进的方法

Conclusion: DEPF方法有效解决了无人机多光谱目标检测的关键挑战，通过双域增强和优先级Mamba融合实现了良好的检测性能

Abstract: Multispectral remote sensing object detection is one of the important
application of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). However, it faces three
challenges. Firstly, the low-light remote sensing images reduce the
complementarity during multi-modality fusion. Secondly, the local small target
modeling is interfered with redundant information in the fusion stage easily.
Thirdly, due to the quadratic computational complexity, it is hard to apply the
transformer-based methods on the UAV platform. To address these limitations,
motivated by Mamba with linear complexity, a UAV multispectral object detector
with dual-domain enhancement and priority-guided mamba fusion (DEPF) is
proposed. Firstly, to enhance low-light remote sensing images, Dual-Domain
Enhancement Module (DDE) is designed, which contains Cross-Scale Wavelet Mamba
(CSWM) and Fourier Details Recovery block (FDR). CSWM applies cross-scale mamba
scanning for the low-frequency components to enhance the global brightness of
images, while FDR constructs spectrum recovery network to enhance the frequency
spectra features for recovering the texture-details. Secondly, to enhance local
target modeling and reduce the impact of redundant information during fusion,
Priority-Guided Mamba Fusion Module (PGMF) is designed. PGMF introduces the
concept of priority scanning, which starts from local targets features
according to the priority scores obtained from modality difference. Experiments
on DroneVehicle dataset and VEDAI dataset reports that, DEPF performs well on
object detection, comparing with state-of-the-art methods. Our code is
available in the supplementary material.

Conclusion: G³CN方法通过拓扑优化和门控机制有效解决了骨架动作识别中的模糊动作区分问题，具有良好的泛化性

Abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have proven to be highly effective for
skeleton-based action recognition, primarily due to their ability to leverage
graph topology for feature aggregation, a key factor in extracting meaningful
representations. However, despite their success, GCNs often struggle to
effectively distinguish between ambiguous actions, revealing limitations in the
representation of learned topological and spatial features. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel approach, Gaussian Topology Refinement Gated
Graph Convolution (G$^{3}$CN), to address the challenge of distinguishing
ambiguous actions in skeleton-based action recognition. G$^{3}$CN incorporates
a Gaussian filter to refine the skeleton topology graph, improving the
representation of ambiguous actions. Additionally, Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)
are integrated into the GCN framework to enhance information propagation
between skeleton points. Our method shows strong generalization across various
GCN backbones. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA
benchmarks demonstrate that G$^{3}$CN effectively improves action recognition,
particularly for ambiguous samples.

Motivation: 现有解析图方法主要关注单模态建模，忽略了多模态融合的潜力。语言可以提供丰富的空间关系先验，但现有的全局特征融合方法在遮挡区域响应较弱且存在对齐和定位问题

Method: 提出PGVL方法，包含引导模块(GM)。低层节点关注局部特征保持遮挡区域响应，高层节点整合全局特征推断遮挡部位。GM使高语义节点引导经过交叉注意力的低语义节点特征更新，实现有效信息融合。包含自上而下分解和自下而上组合两阶段

Result: 在主流姿态估计数据集上验证了PGVL和相应网络的有效性

Conclusion: PGVL通过新颖的引导模块实现了有效的视觉-语言多模态融合，解决了遮挡场景下的人体姿态估计问题

Abstract: Parse graphs boost human pose estimation (HPE) by integrating context and
hierarchies, yet prior work mostly focuses on single modality modeling,
ignoring the potential of multimodal fusion. Notably, language offers rich HPE
priors like spatial relations for occluded scenes, but existing visual-language
fusion via global feature integration weakens occluded region responses and
causes alignment and location failures. To address this issue, we propose Parse
Graph-based Visual-Language interaction (PGVL) with a core novel Guided Module
(GM). In PGVL, low-level nodes focus on local features, maximizing the
maintenance of responses in occluded areas and high-level nodes integrate
global features to infer occluded or invisible parts. GM enables high semantic
nodes to guide the feature update of low semantic nodes that have undergone
cross attention. It ensuring effective fusion of diverse information. PGVL
includes top-down decomposition and bottom-up composition. In the first stage,
modality specific parse graphs are constructed. Next stage. recursive
bidirectional cross-attention is used, purified by GM. We also design network
based on PGVL. The PGVL and our network is validated on major pose estimation
datasets. We will release the code soon.

modeling, either baking textures into simple vertex colors or leaving texture
synthesis to post-processing with image diffusion models. To achieve end-to-end
PBR-ready 3D asset generation, we present Lightweight Gaussian Asset Adapter
(LGAA), a novel framework that unifies the modeling of geometry and PBR
materials by exploiting multi-view (MV) diffusion priors from a novel
perspective. The LGAA features a modular design with three components.
Specifically, the LGAA Wrapper reuses and adapts network layers from MV
diffusion models, which encapsulate knowledge acquired from billions of images,
enabling better convergence in a data-efficient manner. To incorporate multiple
diffusion priors for geometry and PBR synthesis, the LGAA Switcher aligns
multiple LGAA Wrapper layers encapsulating different knowledge. Then, a tamed
variational autoencoder (VAE), termed LGAA Decoder, is designed to predict 2D
Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) with PBR channels. Finally, we introduce a dedicated
post-processing procedure to effectively extract high-quality, relightable mesh
assets from the resulting 2DGS. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of LGAA with both text-and
image-conditioned MV diffusion models. Additionally, the modular design enables
flexible incorporation of multiple diffusion priors, and the
knowledge-preserving scheme leads to efficient convergence trained on merely
69k multi-view instances. Our code, pre-trained weights, and the dataset used
will be publicly available via our project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了EgoGazeVQA基准，利用注视信息提升多模态大模型对第一人称视频的理解能力，通过注视引导的意图提示方法显著改善性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准忽略了注视作为用户意图指示器的重要作用，第一人称视频通过统一坐标系直接捕捉用户焦点、动作和上下文，为个性化AI体验提供了机会

Method: 构建了基于注视的问答对数据集，采用注视引导的意图提示方法整合空间、时间和意图相关线索，并进行注视相关的微调实验

Result: 现有MLLMs难以准确解释用户意图，而注视引导方法显著提升了性能，注视估计准确性影响提示效果

Conclusion: 注视信息对于在第一人称场景中实现更个性化和有效的AI助手具有重要价值

Abstract: The emergence of advanced multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has
significantly enhanced AI assistants' ability to process complex information
across modalities. Recently, egocentric videos, by directly capturing user
focus, actions, and context in an unified coordinate, offer an exciting
opportunity to enable proactive and personalized AI user experiences with
MLLMs. However, existing benchmarks overlook the crucial role of gaze as an
indicator of user intent. To address this gap, we introduce EgoGazeVQA, an
egocentric gaze-guided video question answering benchmark that leverages gaze
information to improve the understanding of longer daily-life videos.
EgoGazeVQA consists of gaze-based QA pairs generated by MLLMs and refined by
human annotators. Our experiments reveal that existing MLLMs struggle to
accurately interpret user intentions. In contrast, our gaze-guided intent
prompting methods significantly enhance performance by integrating spatial,
temporal, and intent-related cues. We further conduct experiments on
gaze-related fine-tuning and analyze how gaze estimation accuracy impacts
prompting effectiveness. These results underscore the value of gaze for more
personalized and effective AI assistants in egocentric settings.

Conclusion: 该研究构建了一个完整的跨视角地理定位流程，将多模态多视角对齐与可解释性分析相结合，统一了准确的跨视角匹配和可解释的理由分析，推进了地理定位领域的透明度和可扩展性

Abstract: Cross-View Geo-Localization (CVGL) focuses on identifying correspondences
between images captured from distinct perspectives of the same geographical
location. However, existing CVGL approaches are typically restricted to a
single view or modality, and their direct visual matching strategy lacks
interpretability: they merely predict whether two images correspond, without
explaining the rationale behind the match. In this paper, we present GLEAM-C, a
foundational CVGL model that unifies multiple views and modalities-including
UAV imagery, street maps, panoramic views, and ground photographs-by aligning
them exclusively with satellite imagery. Our framework enhances training
efficiency through optimized implementation while achieving accuracy comparable
to prior modality-specific CVGL models through a two-phase training strategy.
Moreover, to address the lack of interpretability in traditional CVGL methods,
we leverage the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) to propose a new task, GLEAM-X, which combines cross-view
correspondence prediction with explainable reasoning. To support this task, we
construct a bilingual benchmark using GPT-4o and Doubao-1.5-Thinking-Vision-Pro
to generate training and testing data. The test set is further refined through
detailed human revision, enabling systematic evaluation of explainable
cross-view reasoning and advancing transparency and scalability in
geo-localization. Together, GLEAM-C and GLEAM-X form a comprehensive CVGL
pipeline that integrates multi-modal, multi-view alignment with interpretable
correspondence analysis, unifying accurate cross-view matching with explainable
reasoning and advancing Geo-Localization by enabling models to better Explain
And Match. Code and datasets used in this work will be made publicly accessible

TL;DR: XOCT是一个深度学习框架，通过跨维度监督和多尺度特征融合实现层感知的OCT到OCTA血管重建，显著提升视网膜血管成像质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统OCTA成像存在运动敏感性和高成本问题，现有深度学习方法忽略视网膜层间血管差异，难以重建诊断所需的密集血管细节

Method: 结合跨维度监督模块（利用分层en-face投影作为监督信号）和多尺度特征融合网络（通过多尺度特征提取和通道重加权策略增强血管描绘）

Result: 在OCTA-500数据集上验证了性能提升，特别是在临床评估关键的en-face投影方面表现优异

Conclusion: XOCT有潜力提高OCTA的可及性、可靠性和诊断价值，用于眼科疾病的检测和监测

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) and its derived en-face
projections provide high-resolution visualization of the retinal and choroidal
vasculature, which is critical for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of retinal
diseases. However, acquiring high-quality OCTA images is challenging due to
motion sensitivity and the high costs associated with software modifications
for conventional OCT devices. Moreover, current deep learning methods for
OCT-to-OCTA translation often overlook the vascular differences across retinal
layers and struggle to reconstruct the intricate, dense vascular details
necessary for reliable diagnosis. To overcome these limitations, we propose
XOCT, a novel deep learning framework that integrates Cross-Dimensional
Supervision (CDS) with a Multi-Scale Feature Fusion (MSFF) network for
layer-aware vascular reconstruction. Our CDS module leverages 2D layer-wise
en-face projections, generated via segmentation-weighted z-axis averaging, as
supervisory signals to compel the network to learn distinct representations for
each retinal layer through fine-grained, targeted guidance. Meanwhile, the MSFF
module enhances vessel delineation through multi-scale feature extraction
combined with a channel reweighting strategy, effectively capturing vascular
details at multiple spatial scales. Our experiments on the OCTA-500 dataset
demonstrate XOCT's improvements, especially for the en-face projections which
are significant for clinical evaluation of retinal pathologies, underscoring
its potential to enhance OCTA accessibility, reliability, and diagnostic value
for ophthalmic disease detection and monitoring. The code is available at

Conclusion: 通过深度学习图像转换方法和Swin Transformer模型，可以提高森林碳库存估算的准确性，为大规模森林碳监测提供更有效的技术支撑

Abstract: Forests function as crucial carbon reservoirs on land, and their carbon sinks
can efficiently reduce atmospheric CO2 concentrations and mitigate climate
change. Currently, the overall trend for monitoring and assessing forest carbon
stocks is to integrate ground monitoring sample data with satellite remote
sensing imagery. This style of analysis facilitates large-scale observation.
However, these techniques require improvement in accuracy. We used GF-1 WFV and
Landsat TM images to analyze Huize County, Qujing City, Yunnan Province in
China. Using the style transfer method, we introduced Swin Transformer to
extract global features through attention mechanisms, converting the carbon
stock estimation into an image translation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于机器遗忘的偏置缓解方法，通过选择性移除有偏样本或特征表示来减少视觉模型中的多种偏置形式，在三个基准数据集上显著改善了人口统计公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在训练数据中经常依赖虚假相关性，导致在医疗和自动驾驶等安全关键领域产生有偏或不公平的预测。传统偏置缓解方法需要从头重新训练或重新设计数据管道，而机器遗忘技术提供了一种有前景的后处理模型修正替代方案。

Method: 基于隐私保护遗忘技术，评估了多种策略包括梯度上升、LoRA和师生蒸馏方法。在三个基准数据集（CUB-200-2011的姿态偏置、CIFAR-10的合成补丁偏置、CelebA的微笑检测中的性别偏置）上进行实证分析。

Result: 后处理遗忘能够显著减少子群差异，在CUB-200上人口统计公平性改善达94.86%，CIFAR-10上30.28%，CelebA上97.37%。这些改进以最小的准确率损失实现，在效用、公平性、质量和隐私的联合评估中平均得分为0.62。

Conclusion: 研究结果确立了机器遗忘作为一个实用框架，可以在不需要完全重新训练的情况下增强已部署视觉系统的公平性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks often rely on spurious correlations in training data,
leading to biased or unfair predictions in safety-critical domains such as
medicine and autonomous driving. While conventional bias mitigation typically
requires retraining from scratch or redesigning data pipelines, recent advances
in machine unlearning provide a promising alternative for post-hoc model
correction. In this work, we investigate \textit{Bias-Aware Machine
Unlearning}, a paradigm that selectively removes biased samples or feature
representations to mitigate diverse forms of bias in vision models. Building on
privacy-preserving unlearning techniques, we evaluate various strategies
including Gradient Ascent, LoRA, and Teacher-Student distillation. Through
empirical analysis on three benchmark datasets, CUB-200-2011 (pose bias),
CIFAR-10 (synthetic patch bias), and CelebA (gender bias in smile detection),
we demonstrate that post-hoc unlearning can substantially reduce subgroup
disparities, with improvements in demographic parity of up to \textbf{94.86\%}
on CUB-200, \textbf{30.28\%} on CIFAR-10, and \textbf{97.37\%} on CelebA. These
gains are achieved with minimal accuracy loss and with methods scoring an
average of 0.62 across the 3 settings on the joint evaluation of utility,
fairness, quality, and privacy. Our findings establish machine unlearning as a
practical framework for enhancing fairness in deployed vision systems without
necessitating full retraining.

Conclusion: ANYPORTAL是一个训练免费、效果优秀的视频背景替换框架，成功解决了前景一致性和时间连贯重新光照的挑战

Abstract: Despite the rapid advancements in video generation technology, creating
high-quality videos that precisely align with user intentions remains a
significant challenge. Existing methods often fail to achieve fine-grained
control over video details, limiting their practical applicability. We
introduce ANYPORTAL, a novel zero-shot framework for video background
replacement that leverages pre-trained diffusion models. Our framework
collaboratively integrates the temporal prior of video diffusion models with
the relighting capabilities of image diffusion models in a zero-shot setting.
To address the critical challenge of foreground consistency, we propose a
Refinement Projection Algorithm, which enables pixel-level detail manipulation
to ensure precise foreground preservation. ANYPORTAL is training-free and
overcomes the challenges of achieving foreground consistency and temporally
coherent relighting. Experimental results demonstrate that ANYPORTAL achieves
high-quality results on consumer-grade GPUs, offering a practical and efficient
solution for video content creation and editing.

MedicalPatchNet matches the classification performance (AUROC 0.907 vs. 0.908)
of EfficientNet-B0, while substantially improving interpretability:
MedicalPatchNet demonstrates substantially improved interpretability with
higher pathology localization accuracy (mean hit-rate 0.485 vs. 0.376 with
Grad-CAM) on the CheXlocalize dataset. By providing explicit, reliable
explanations accessible even to non-AI experts, MedicalPatchNet mitigates risks

Abstract: Vector graphics, known for their scalability and user-friendliness, provide a
unique approach to visual content compared to traditional pixel-based images.
Animation of these graphics, driven by the motion of their elements, offers
enhanced comprehensibility and controllability but often requires substantial
manual effort. To automate this process, we propose a novel method that
integrates implicit neural representations with text-to-video diffusion models
for vector graphic animation. Our approach employs layered implicit neural
representations to reconstruct vector graphics, preserving their inherent
properties such as infinite resolution and precise color and shape constraints,
which effectively bridges the large domain gap between vector graphics and
diffusion models. The neural representations are then optimized using video
score distillation sampling, which leverages motion priors from pretrained
text-to-video diffusion models. Finally, the vector graphics are warped to
match the representations resulting in smooth animation. Experimental results
validate the effectiveness of our method in generating vivid and natural vector
graphic animations, demonstrating significant improvement over existing
techniques that suffer from limitations in flexibility and animation quality.

Abstract: We address vision-language-driven indoor navigation to assist visually
impaired individuals in reaching a target location using images and natural
language guidance. Traditional navigation systems are ineffective indoors due
to the lack of precise location data. Our approach integrates vision and
language models to generate step-by-step navigational instructions, enhancing
accessibility and independence. We fine-tune the BLIP-2 model with Low Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) on a manually annotated indoor navigation dataset. We propose
an evaluation metric that refines the BERT F1 score by emphasizing directional

navigational performance. After applying LoRA, the model significantly improved
in generating directional instructions, overcoming limitations in the original
BLIP-2 model.

Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅在渲染方面效果出色，但由于表示的非结构化和缺乏显式几何监督，难以实现准确完整的表面重建。

Method: 提出统一框架DiGS，将SDF学习直接嵌入3DGS流程，为每个高斯基元关联可学习SDF值，并设计几何引导的多尺度网格增长策略。

Result: 在DTU、Mip-NeRF 360和Tanks&Temples等标准基准测试中，DiGS在保持高渲染保真度的同时，显著提高了重建准确性和完整性。

Conclusion: DiGS通过引入SDF学习和几何引导策略，成功解决了3DGS在表面重建方面的挑战，实现了渲染质量和几何精度之间的平衡。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for
photorealistic view synthesis, representing scenes with spatially distributed
Gaussian primitives. While highly effective for rendering, achieving accurate
and complete surface reconstruction remains challenging due to the unstructured
nature of the representation and the absence of explicit geometric supervision.
In this work, we propose DiGS, a unified framework that embeds Signed Distance
Field (SDF) learning directly into the 3DGS pipeline, thereby enforcing strong
and interpretable surface priors. By associating each Gaussian with a learnable
SDF value, DiGS explicitly aligns primitives with underlying geometry and
improves cross-view consistency. To further ensure dense and coherent coverage,
we design a geometry-guided grid growth strategy that adaptively distributes
Gaussians along geometry-consistent regions under a multi-scale hierarchy.
Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, including DTU, Mip-NeRF 360, and
Tanks& Temples, demonstrate that DiGS consistently improves reconstruction
accuracy and completeness while retaining high rendering fidelity.

Conclusion: 局部混合策略和logits优化能有效提升对抗性攻击的转移性和突破能力

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing
significant security threats to their deployment in remote sensing
applications. Research on adversarial attacks not only reveals model
vulnerabilities but also provides critical insights for enhancing robustness.
Although current mixing-based strategies have been proposed to increase the
transferability of adversarial examples, they either perform global blending or
directly exchange a region in the images, which may destroy global semantic
features and mislead the optimization of adversarial examples. Furthermore,
their reliance on cross-entropy loss for perturbation optimization leads to
gradient diminishing during iterative updates, compromising adversarial example
quality. To address these limitations, we focus on non-targeted attacks and
propose a novel framework via local mixing and logits optimization. First, we
present a local mixing strategy to generate diverse yet semantically consistent
inputs. Different from MixUp, which globally blends two images, and MixCut,
which stitches images together, our method merely blends local regions to
preserve global semantic information. Second, we adapt the logit loss from
targeted attacks to non-targeted scenarios, mitigating the gradient vanishing
problem of cross-entropy loss. Third, a perturbation smoothing loss is applied
to suppress high-frequency noise and enhance transferability. Extensive
experiments on FGSCR-42 and MTARSI datasets demonstrate superior performance
over 12 state-of-the-art methods across 6 surrogate models. Notably, with
ResNet as the surrogate on MTARSI, our method achieves a 17.28% average
improvement in black-box attack success rate.

Conclusion: MVAT证明了利用时序多视图信息可以有效解决弱监督3D检测中的投影模糊性问题，无需任何3D框标注即可实现接近全监督的性能

Abstract: Annotating 3D data remains a costly bottleneck for 3D object detection,
motivating the development of weakly supervised annotation methods that rely on
more accessible 2D box annotations. However, relying solely on 2D boxes
introduces projection ambiguities since a single 2D box can correspond to
multiple valid 3D poses. Furthermore, partial object visibility under a single
viewpoint setting makes accurate 3D box estimation difficult. We propose MVAT,
a novel framework that leverages temporal multi-view present in sequential data
to address these challenges. Our approach aggregates object-centric point
clouds across time to build 3D object representations as dense and complete as
possible. A Teacher-Student distillation paradigm is employed: The Teacher
network learns from single viewpoints but targets are derived from temporally
aggregated static objects. Then the Teacher generates high quality
pseudo-labels that the Student learns to predict from a single viewpoint for
both static and moving objects. The whole framework incorporates a multi-view
2D projection loss to enforce consistency between predicted 3D boxes and all
available 2D annotations. Experiments on the nuScenes and Waymo Open datasets
demonstrate that MVAT achieves state-of-the-art performance for weakly
supervised 3D object detection, significantly narrowing the gap with fully
supervised methods without requiring any 3D box annotations. % \footnote{Code

Abstract: Hand gesture understanding is essential for several applications in
human-computer interaction, including automatic clinical assessment of hand
dexterity. While deep learning has advanced static gesture recognition, dynamic
gesture understanding remains challenging due to complex spatiotemporal
variations. Moreover, existing datasets often lack multimodal and multi-view
diversity, precise ground-truth tracking, and an action quality component
embedded within gestures. This paper introduces EHWGesture, a multimodal video
dataset for gesture understanding featuring five clinically relevant gestures.
It includes over 1,100 recordings (6 hours), captured from 25 healthy subjects
using two high-resolution RGB-Depth cameras and an event camera. A motion
capture system provides precise ground-truth hand landmark tracking, and all
devices are spatially calibrated and synchronized to ensure cross-modal
alignment. Moreover, to embed an action quality task within gesture
understanding, collected recordings are organized in classes of execution speed
that mirror clinical evaluations of hand dexterity. Baseline experiments
highlight the dataset's potential for gesture classification, gesture trigger
detection, and action quality assessment. Thus, EHWGesture can serve as a
comprehensive benchmark for advancing multimodal clinical gesture

### [42] [Universal Few-Shot Spatial Control for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07530)
*Kiet T. Nguyen,Chanhuyk Lee,Donggyun Kim,Dong Hoon Lee,Seunghoon Hong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UFC是一个通用的少样本控制适配器，能够通过少量样本快速适应新的空间控制任务，在多个扩散模型架构上实现细粒度控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的控制适配器在面对与训练任务差异较大的新空间控制条件时，适应性有限且训练成本高，需要一种能够快速适应新任务的通用解决方案。

Method: 提出UFC方法，通过查询条件和支持条件之间的类比来构建任务特定的控制特征，使用匹配机制和小型任务特定参数集进行更新，仅需30个标注样本即可微调。

Result: 在6个新空间控制任务上的实验表明，UFC仅使用0.1%的全训练数据就能达到与全监督基线相当的性能，适用于UNet和DiT等多种扩散模型架构。

Conclusion: UFC提供了一种高效且通用的少样本空间控制解决方案，显著降低了新控制任务的适应成本，同时保持了高质量的控制性能。

Abstract: Spatial conditioning in pretrained text-to-image diffusion models has
significantly improved fine-grained control over the structure of generated
images. However, existing control adapters exhibit limited adaptability and
incur high training costs when encountering novel spatial control conditions
that differ substantially from the training tasks. To address this limitation,
we propose Universal Few-Shot Control (UFC), a versatile few-shot control
adapter capable of generalizing to novel spatial conditions. Given a few
image-condition pairs of an unseen task and a query condition, UFC leverages
the analogy between query and support conditions to construct task-specific
control features, instantiated by a matching mechanism and an update on a small
set of task-specific parameters. Experiments on six novel spatial control tasks
show that UFC, fine-tuned with only 30 annotated examples of novel tasks,
achieves fine-grained control consistent with the spatial conditions. Notably,
when fine-tuned with 0.1% of the full training data, UFC achieves competitive
performance with the fully supervised baselines in various control tasks. We
also show that UFC is applicable agnostically to various diffusion backbones
and demonstrate its effectiveness on both UNet and DiT architectures. Code is

TL;DR: 通过HU基于前景掩码策略改进MIM在3D医学图像分割中的表征学习，重点关注解剖结构密度而非随机掩码


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决随机掩码策略在3D医学图像中忽视解剖结构密度的问题，提高预文任务的有效性

Method: 采用基于Hounsfield Unit(HU)测量的前景掩码策略，重点掩码内臭器官等解剖结构，排除空气、液体等无诊断价值的区域

Result: 在5个公开3D医学图像数据集上持续改善性能，分割质量和Dice分数显著提升(BTCV:~84.64%，Flare22:~92.43%，MM-WHS:~90.67%，Amos22:~88.64%，BraTS:~78.55%)

Conclusion: 预训练方法需要考虑领域特定知识，HU基于掩码策略为医学图像表征学习提供了有前景的方向

Abstract: While Masked Image Modeling (MIM) has revolutionized fields of computer
vision, its adoption in 3D medical image computing has been limited by the use
of random masking, which overlooks the density of anatomical objects. To
address this limitation, we enhance the pretext task with a simple yet
effective masking strategy. Leveraging Hounsfield Unit (HU) measurements, we
implement an HU-based Foreground Masking, which focuses on the intensity
distribution of visceral organs and excludes non-tissue regions, such as air
and fluid, that lack diagnostically meaningful features. Extensive experiments
on five public 3D medical imaging datasets demonstrate that our masking
consistently improves performance, both in quality of segmentation and Dice
score (BTCV:~84.64\%, Flare22:~92.43\%, MM-WHS:~90.67\%, Amos22:~88.64\%,
BraTS:~78.55\%). These results underscore the importance of domain-centric MIM
and suggest a promising direction for representation learning in medical image
segmentation. Implementation is available at github.com/AISeedHub/SubFore/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文档图像包含丰富知识，语音查询具有便携性和灵活性，但此前没有工作探索在视觉文档图像上直接使用语音查询进行知识库问答。

Method: 提出端到端框架，直接解释语音、检索相关视觉知识并生成答案；集成布局感知重排序机制来优化检索性能。

Result: 实验显示在效率和准确性方面都有显著提升；发布了首个双语语音-文档RAG数据集（中英文语音查询+多模态文档内容）。

Conclusion: TextlessRAG为语音文档问答提供了创新解决方案，通过消除传统文本处理步骤实现了更高效的端到端处理，推动了该研究方向的发展。

Abstract: Document images encapsulate a wealth of knowledge, while the portability of
spoken queries enables broader and flexible application scenarios. Yet, no
prior work has explored knowledge base question answering over visual document
images with queries provided directly in speech. We propose TextlessRAG, the
first end-to-end framework for speech-based question answering over large-scale
document images. Unlike prior methods, TextlessRAG eliminates ASR, TTS and OCR,
directly interpreting speech, retrieving relevant visual knowledge, and
generating answers in a fully textless pipeline. To further boost performance,
we integrate a layout-aware reranking mechanism to refine retrieval.
Experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in both efficiency and
accuracy. To advance research in this direction, we also release the first
bilingual speech--document RAG dataset, featuring Chinese and English voice
queries paired with multimodal document content. Both the dataset and our
pipeline will be made available at

TL;DR: 从单张无姿势图像通过单次前向传播完成高斯全头部重建，避免了以往GAN逆向化和测试时优化的耗时问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从单张无姿势图像快速重建3D全头部模型的挑战，避免传统方法的计算成本和时间消耗

Method: 使用大规模合成数据集训练，采用由粗到细的高斯头部生成流水线，通过双分支框架聚合球面三平面特征和点基特征进行高效重建

Result: 实验结果表明该框架在高斯头部重建方面显示出了有效性

Conclusion: 该前向传播框架能够实现快速的单图全头部重建和渲染，为3D头部生成领域提供了一种高效的解决方案

Abstract: We present a feed-forward framework for Gaussian full-head synthesis from a
single unposed image. Unlike previous work that relies on time-consuming GAN
inversion and test-time optimization, our framework can reconstruct the
Gaussian full-head model given a single unposed image in a single forward pass.
This enables fast reconstruction and rendering during inference. To mitigate
the lack of large-scale 3D head assets, we propose a large-scale synthetic
dataset from trained 3D GANs and train our framework using only synthetic data.
For efficient high-fidelity generation, we introduce a coarse-to-fine Gaussian
head generation pipeline, where sparse points from the FLAME model interact
with the image features by transformer blocks for feature extraction and coarse
shape reconstruction, which are then densified for high-fidelity
reconstruction. To fully leverage the prior knowledge residing in pretrained 3D
GANs for effective reconstruction, we propose a dual-branch framework that
effectively aggregates the structured spherical triplane feature and
unstructured point-based features for more effective Gaussian head
reconstruction. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our framework
towards existing work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在黑盒性质限制了其在需要信任和问责的高风险应用中的采用，特别是在3D形状识别任务中需要可解释的模型。

Method: 使用图注意力卷积和内在注意力机制，通过注意力rollout可视化决策过程，评估了局部平均曲率和到质心距离等节点特征，以及模型深度的影响。

Result: 结合局部平均曲率和到质心距离的节点特征获得了0.76加权F1分数，并产生了更全面的注意力可视化效果，包含指向全局CLS节点的有向边的模型产生了更直观的注意力图。

Conclusion: CGAT架构能够生成人类可理解的注意力图，增强信任并促进专家验证模型决策，虽然基于牙科数据演示，但广泛适用于基于图的分类和回归任务。

Abstract: Deep learning offers a promising avenue for automating many recognition tasks
in fields such as medicine and forensics. However, the black-box nature of
these models hinders their adoption in high-stakes applications where trust and
accountability are required. For 3D shape recognition tasks in particular, this
paper introduces the Class Node Graph Attention Network (CGAT) architecture to
address this need. Applied to 3D meshes of third molars derived from CBCT
images, for Demirjian stage allocation, CGAT utilizes graph attention
convolutions and an inherent attention mechanism, visualized via attention
rollout, to explain its decision-making process. We evaluated the local mean
curvature and distance to centroid node features, both individually and in
combination, as well as model depth, finding that models incorporating directed
edges to a global CLS node produced more intuitive attention maps, while also
yielding desirable classification performance. We analyzed the attention-based
explanations of the models, and their predictive performances to propose
optimal settings for the CGAT. The combination of local mean curvature and
distance to centroid as node features yielded a slight performance increase
with 0.76 weighted F1 score, and more comprehensive attention visualizations.
The CGAT architecture's ability to generate human-understandable attention maps
can enhance trust and facilitate expert validation of model decisions. While
demonstrated on dental data, CGAT is broadly applicable to graph-based
classification and regression tasks, promoting wider adoption of transparent
and competitive deep learning models in high-stakes environments.

TL;DR: 提出了Visual-TableQA数据集，包含2.5K个LaTeX渲染表格和6K个推理密集型QA对，通过多LLM协作生成，成本低于100美元，显著提升模型在表格视觉推理任务上的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在表格图像推理方面的基准测试在规模、多样性和推理深度方面存在局限，需要大规模开放域多模态数据集来评估和增强复杂表格数据的视觉推理能力

Method: 采用模块化、可扩展的全自动生成流水线，多个推理LLM在不同角色（生成、验证、启发）上协作，通过跨模型提示和LLM陪审团过滤实现多模型协作数据生成

Conclusion: Visual-TableQA为表格视觉推理提供了有效的训练资源，证明了合成数据生成方法的有效性，相关资源和完整流水线已公开

Abstract: Visual reasoning over structured data such as tables is a critical capability
for modern vision-language models (VLMs), yet current benchmarks remain limited
in scale, diversity, or reasoning depth, especially when it comes to rendered
table images. Addressing this gap, we introduce Visual-TableQA, a large-scale,
open-domain multimodal dataset specifically designed to evaluate and enhance
visual reasoning over complex tabular data. Our generation pipeline is modular,
scalable, and fully autonomous, involving multiple reasoning LLMs collaborating
across distinct roles: generation, validation, and inspiration. Visual-TableQA
comprises 2.5k richly structured LaTeX-rendered tables and 6k
reasoning-intensive QA pairs, all produced at a cost of under USD 100. To
promote diversity and creativity, our pipeline performs multi-model
collaborative data generation via cross-model prompting ('inspiration') and
LLM-jury filtering. Stronger models seed layouts and topics that weaker models
elaborate, collectively distilling diverse reasoning patterns and visual
structures into the dataset. Empirical results show that models fine-tuned on
Visual-TableQA generalize robustly to external benchmarks, outperforming
several proprietary models despite the dataset's synthetic nature. The full
pipeline and resources are publicly available at

Abstract: Temporal image forensics is the science of estimating the age of a digital
image. Usually, time-dependent traces (age traces) introduced by the image
acquisition pipeline are exploited for this purpose. In this review, a
comprehensive overview of the field of temporal image forensics based on
time-dependent traces from the image acquisition pipeline is given. This
includes a detailed insight into the properties of known age traces (i.e.,
in-field sensor defects and sensor dust) and temporal image forensics
techniques. Another key aspect of this work is to highlight the problem of
content bias and to illustrate how important eXplainable Artificial
Intelligence methods are to verify the reliability of temporal image forensics
techniques. Apart from reviewing material presented in previous works, in this
review: (i) a new (probably more realistic) forensic setting is proposed; (ii)
the main properties (growth rate and spatial distribution) of in-field sensor
defects are verified; (iii) it is shown that a method proposed to utilize
in-field sensor defects for image age approximation actually exploits other
traces (most likely content bias); (iv) the features learned by a neural
network dating palmprint images are further investigated; (v) it is shown how
easily a neural network can be distracted from learning age traces. For this
purpose, previous work is analyzed, re-implemented if required and experiments
are conducted.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源多模态模型存在推理模式单调、交互轮次有限的问题，难以处理需要试错探索的复杂视觉任务。

Method: 构建Visual Probe数据集、开发迭代数据收集管道获取多样化推理轨迹、提出超轮次掩码策略平衡训练效率和测试可扩展性。

Result: 模型在仅6轮交互训练的情况下，推理时可自然扩展到数十轮，准确率随轮次增加而提升，在挑战性视觉搜索任务上达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: Mini-o3通过规模化工具交互和深度多轮推理，成功解决了复杂视觉搜索问题，产生了丰富的推理模式和深度思考路径。

Abstract: Recent advances in large multimodal models have leveraged image-based tools
with reinforcement learning to tackle visual problems. However, existing
open-source approaches often exhibit monotonous reasoning patterns and allow
only a limited number of interaction turns, making them inadequate for
difficult tasks that require trial-and-error exploration. In this work, we
address this limitation by scaling up tool-based interactions and introduce
Mini-o3, a system that executes deep, multi-turn reasoning -- spanning tens of
steps -- and achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging visual search
tasks. Our recipe for reproducing OpenAI o3-style behaviors comprises three key
components. First, we construct the Visual Probe Dataset, a collection of
thousands of challenging visual search problems designed for exploratory
reasoning. Second, we develop an iterative data collection pipeline to obtain
cold-start trajectories that exhibit diverse reasoning patterns, including
depth-first search, trial-and-error, and goal maintenance. Third, we propose an
over-turn masking strategy that prevents penalization of over-turn responses
(those that hit the maximum number of turns) during reinforcement learning,
thereby balancing training-time efficiency with test-time scalability. Despite
training with an upper bound of only six interaction turns, our model generates
trajectories that naturally scale to tens of turns at inference time, with
accuracy improving as the number of turns increases. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Mini-o3 produces rich reasoning patterns and deep thinking
paths, effectively solving challenging visual search problems.

TL;DR: 研究发现视觉语言基础模型中的性别偏见评估容易受到非性别特征（如物体和背景）的干扰，即使微小扰动也会显著改变偏见得分，建议在报告偏见指标时同时报告特征敏感性测量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于真实世界图像的性别偏见评估基准存在性别与非性别特征之间的虚假相关性，需要研究这些虚假特征是否扭曲了性别偏见评估的可靠性。

Method: 系统性地扰动四个广泛使用的基准（COCO-gender、FACET、MIAP、PHASE）和各种VLMs中的非性别特征，量化它们对偏见评估的影响。

Result: 即使最小扰动（如仅遮蔽10%物体或轻微模糊背景）也能显著改变偏见得分，生成式VLMs指标变化高达175%，CLIP变体变化达43%。

Conclusion: 当前偏见评估往往反映模型对虚假特征的反应而非真实性别偏见，建议在报告偏见指标时同时报告特征敏感性测量以实现更可靠的偏见评估。

Abstract: Gender bias in vision-language foundation models (VLMs) raises concerns about
their safe deployment and is typically evaluated using benchmarks with gender
annotations on real-world images. However, as these benchmarks often contain
spurious correlations between gender and non-gender features, such as objects
and backgrounds, we identify a critical oversight in gender bias evaluation: Do
spurious features distort gender bias evaluation? To address this question, we
systematically perturb non-gender features across four widely used benchmarks
(COCO-gender, FACET, MIAP, and PHASE) and various VLMs to quantify their impact
on bias evaluation. Our findings reveal that even minimal perturbations, such
as masking just 10% of objects or weakly blurring backgrounds, can dramatically
alter bias scores, shifting metrics by up to 175% in generative VLMs and 43% in
CLIP variants. This suggests that current bias evaluations often reflect model
responses to spurious features rather than gender bias, undermining their
reliability. Since creating spurious feature-free benchmarks is fundamentally
challenging, we recommend reporting bias metrics alongside feature-sensitivity
measurements to enable a more reliable bias assessment.

Motivation: 现有医疗视觉-语言模型存在三个主要问题：元数据利用不充分、缺乏临床诊断知识集成、以3D医学形态应用效果有限。需要一种数据高效的方法来充分利用现有模型能力并适配到3D医学形态。

Method: 1. 将结构化元数据转换为合成报告，丰富文本输入以改善图像-文本对齐

Conclusion: 该研究提出的数据高效细调流水线有效解决了医疗视觉-语言模型在3D医学形态中的应用挑战，通过元数据利用和临床指标集成显著提升了模型性能，为医学AI领域提供了一种可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (Med-VLMs) have shown impressive results in
tasks such as report generation and visual question answering, but they still
face several limitations. Most notably, they underutilize patient metadata and
lack integration of clinical diagnostic knowledge. Moreover, most existing
models are typically trained from scratch or fine-tuned on large-scale 2D
image-text pairs, requiring extensive computational resources, and their
effectiveness on 3D medical imaging is often limited due to the absence of
structural information. To address these gaps, we propose a data-efficient
fine-tuning pipeline to adapt 3D CT-based Med-VLMs for 3D MRI and demonstrate
its application in Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. Our system introduces
two key innovations. First, we convert structured metadata into synthetic
reports, enriching textual input for improved image-text alignment. Second, we
add an auxiliary token trained to predict the mini-mental state examination
(MMSE) score, a widely used clinical measure of cognitive function that
correlates with AD severity. This provides additional supervision for
fine-tuning. Applying lightweight prompt tuning to both image and text
modalities, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on two AD
datasets using 1,500 training images, outperforming existing methods fine-tuned
on 10,000 images. Code will be released upon publication.

Motivation: 解决传统深度学习方法对大量标签数据的依赖以及表征可解释性不足的问题。

Method: 提出自监督跨编码器框架，通过对比学习约束静态表征，通过输入梯度正则化指导动态表征学习，并利用纵向MRI扫描的时间连续性进行监督。

Result: 在ADNI数据集上实现了更高的分类准确性和改进的可解释性，并在OASIS和PPMI数据集上展现出强劲的零样本和跨任务泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为神经退行性疾病的MRI诊断提供了一种无需大量标签数据、具有较高可解释性且泛化能力强的新方案。

Abstract: Deep learning has shown significant potential in diagnosing neurodegenerative
diseases from MRI data. However, most existing methods rely heavily on large
volumes of labeled data and often yield representations that lack
interpretability. To address both challenges, we propose a novel
self-supervised cross-encoder framework that leverages the temporal continuity
in longitudinal MRI scans for supervision. This framework disentangles learned
representations into two components: a static representation, constrained by
contrastive learning, which captures stable anatomical features; and a dynamic
representation, guided by input-gradient regularization, which reflects
temporal changes and can be effectively fine-tuned for downstream
classification tasks. Experimental results on the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate that our method achieves
superior classification accuracy and improved interpretability. Furthermore,
the learned representations exhibit strong zero-shot generalization on the Open
Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) dataset and cross-task generalization
on the Parkinson Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) dataset. The code for the
proposed method will be made publicly available.

Motivation: 现有语义水印技术虽然能抵御重生攻击，但因频域完整性损失导致检测性能降低，需要解决这一问题。

Method: 提出Hermitian对称频域水印技术(SFW)，通过强制Hermitian对称维护频域完整性；以及中心感知嵌入策略，通过确保稳健信息保留来降低剪裁攻击的脏强性。

Result: 实验结果显示该方法在各种攻击场景下达到了最高的检测准确率，同时保持优秀的图像保真度(FID和CLIP分数)，超越了之前的方法。

Conclusion: SFW是一个有效的框架，能够在稳健性和图像保真度之间取得平衡，解决了语义水印中的内在交换问题。

Abstract: Semantic watermarking techniques for latent diffusion models (LDMs) are
robust against regeneration attacks, but often suffer from detection
performance degradation due to the loss of frequency integrity. To tackle this
problem, we propose a novel embedding method called Hermitian Symmetric Fourier
Watermarking (SFW), which maintains frequency integrity by enforcing Hermitian
symmetry. Additionally, we introduce a center-aware embedding strategy that
reduces the vulnerability of semantic watermarking due to cropping attacks by
ensuring robust information retention. To validate our approach, we apply these
techniques to existing semantic watermarking schemes, enhancing their
frequency-domain structures for better robustness and retrieval accuracy.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our methods achieve state-of-the-art
verification and identification performance, surpassing previous approaches
across various attack scenarios. Ablation studies confirm the impact of SFW on
detection capabilities, the effectiveness of the center-aware embedding against
cropping, and how message capacity influences identification accuracy. Notably,
our method achieves the highest detection accuracy while maintaining superior
image fidelity, as evidenced by FID and CLIP scores. Conclusively, our proposed
SFW is shown to be an effective framework for balancing robustness and image
fidelity, addressing the inherent trade-offs in semantic watermarking. Code

Conclusion: 该方法既有效又具有通用性，证明了通过建模背景低秩结构来解决小目标检测问题的有效性

Abstract: Small moving target detection is crucial for many defense applications but
remains highly challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratios, ambiguous visual
cues, and cluttered backgrounds. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning
framework that differs fundamentally from existing approaches, which often rely
on target-specific features or motion cues and tend to lack robustness in
complex environments. Our key insight is that small target detection and
background discrimination are inherently coupled, even cluttered video
backgrounds often exhibit strong low-rank structures that can serve as stable
priors for detection. We reformulate the task as a tensor-based low-rank and
sparse decomposition problem and conduct a theoretical analysis of the
background, target, and noise components to guide model design. Building on
these insights, we introduce TenRPCANet, a deep neural network that requires
minimal assumptions about target characteristics. Specifically, we propose a
tokenization strategy that implicitly enforces multi-order tensor low-rank
priors through a self-attention mechanism. This mechanism captures both local
and non-local self-similarity to model the low-rank background without relying
on explicit iterative optimization. In addition, inspired by the sparse
component update in tensor RPCA, we design a feature refinement module to
enhance target saliency. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on two highly distinct and challenging tasks: multi-frame infrared
small target detection and space object detection. These results demonstrate
both the effectiveness and the generalizability of our approach.

Result: EDFFDNet将参数、内存和总运行时间分别减少了70.5%、32.6%和33.7%，同时PSNR比最先进方法提高了0.5 dB。EDFFDNet-2进一步将PSNR提高了1.06 dB，同时保持较低计算成本。

Conclusion: 该方法在处理深度差异场景方面表现出色，具有强泛化能力，在多个数据集上优于之前的深度学习方法，实现了效率与精度的双重提升。

Abstract: Previous deep image registration methods that employ single homography,
multi-grid homography, or thin-plate spline often struggle with real scenes
containing depth disparities due to their inherent limitations. To address
this, we propose an Exponential-Decay Free-Form Deformation Network (EDFFDNet),
which employs free-form deformation with an exponential-decay basis function.
This design achieves higher efficiency and performs well in scenes with depth
disparities, benefiting from its inherent locality. We also introduce an
Adaptive Sparse Motion Aggregator (ASMA), which replaces the MLP motion
aggregator used in previous methods. By transforming dense interactions into
sparse ones, ASMA reduces parameters and improves accuracy. Additionally, we
propose a progressive correlation refinement strategy that leverages
global-local correlation patterns for coarse-to-fine motion estimation, further
enhancing efficiency and accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that EDFFDNet
reduces parameters, memory, and total runtime by 70.5%, 32.6%, and 33.7%,
respectively, while achieving a 0.5 dB PSNR gain over the state-of-the-art
method. With an additional local refinement stage,EDFFDNet-2 further improves
PSNR by 1.06 dB while maintaining lower computational costs. Our method also
demonstrates strong generalization ability across datasets, outperforming
previous deep learning methods.

<details>

Motivation: 标准对抗训练无法显式处理类间特征重叠问题，而这是对抗脏性的重要因素

Method: 识别每个对抗样本的最近跨类邻居，然后在特征空间中抛出这些邻居的投影，强化特征可分离性

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和SVHN标准数据集上表现竞争力，在对抗性和清洁准确率方面都取得显著成就

Conclusion: 显式处理类间特征近似性对提升神经网络对抗性至关重要

Abstract: Deep neural networks have exhibited impressive performance in image
classification tasks but remain vulnerable to adversarial examples. Standard
adversarial training enhances robustness but typically fails to explicitly
address inter-class feature overlap, a significant contributor to adversarial
susceptibility. In this work, we introduce a novel adversarial training
framework that actively mitigates inter-class proximity by projecting out
inter-class dependencies from adversarial and clean samples in the feature
space. Specifically, our approach first identifies the nearest inter-class
neighbors for each adversarial sample and subsequently removes projections onto
these neighbors to enforce stronger feature separability. Theoretically, we
demonstrate that our proposed logits correction reduces the Lipschitz constant
of neural networks, thereby lowering the Rademacher complexity, which directly
contributes to improved generalization and robustness. Extensive experiments
across standard benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN show that
our method demonstrates strong performance that is competitive with leading
adversarial training techniques, highlighting significant achievements in both
robust and clean accuracy. Our findings reveal the importance of addressing
inter-class feature proximity explicitly to bolster adversarial robustness in
DNNs.

Motivation: 现有视频理解模型在短片段感知任务上表现良好，但在需要复杂推理的长视频任务中性能下降。研究旨在探索如何利用现有感知能力进行更复杂的视频推理。

Method: 开发了一个大型语言模型代理，可以访问视频模块作为子代理或工具。代理根据每个模块调用的结果动态决定后续步骤，并引入批评机制来区分成功和不成功的执行序列。

Result: 该方法在LVBench、Neptune和ActivityNet-RTL等数据集上实现了强劲的性能表现。

Conclusion: 结合代理和批评机制的方法能够有效提升复杂视频推理任务的性能，为长视频理解提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Video understanding has seen significant progress in recent years, with
models' performance on perception from short clips continuing to rise. Yet,
multiple recent benchmarks, such as LVBench, Neptune, and ActivityNet-RTL, show
performance wanes for tasks requiring complex reasoning on videos as queries
grow more complex and videos grow longer. In this work, we ask: can existing
perception capabilities be leveraged to successfully perform more complex video
reasoning? In particular, we develop a large language model agent given access
to video modules as subagents or tools. Rather than following a fixed procedure
to solve queries as in previous work such as Visual Programming, ViperGPT, and
MoReVQA, the agent uses the results of each call to a module to determine
subsequent steps. Inspired by work in the textual reasoning domain, we
introduce a critic to distinguish between instances of successful and
unsuccessful sequences from the agent. We show that the combination of our
agent and critic achieve strong performance on the previously-mentioned
datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习方法大多使用单一熵模型估计整个图像的概率分布，无法有效捕捉不同语义区域的多样化统计特征

Method: 利用语义分割识别不同区域，为每个区域分配专用熵模型，采用多通道离散逻辑混合似然来有效建模像素值分布

Result: 在基准数据集上实现了最先进的压缩比，同时仅引入最小的编码和解码延迟

Conclusion: SEEC框架通过语义分割指导的多熵模型选择，能够更准确地估计不同语义区域的概率分布，在保持高效率的同时支持感兴趣区域编码

Abstract: Recently, learned image compression has attracted considerable attention due
to its superior performance over traditional methods. However, most existing
approaches employ a single entropy model to estimate the probability
distribution of pixel values across the entire image, which limits their
ability to capture the diverse statistical characteristics of different
semantic regions. To overcome this limitation, we propose Segmentation-Assisted
Multi-Entropy Models for Lossless Image Compression (SEEC). Our framework
utilizes semantic segmentation to guide the selection and adaptation of
multiple entropy models, enabling more accurate probability distribution
estimation for distinct semantic regions. Specifically, SEEC first extracts
image features and then applies semantic segmentation to identify different
regions, each assigned a specialized entropy model to better capture its unique
statistical properties. Finally, a multi-channel discrete logistic mixture
likelihood is employed to model the pixel value distributions effectively.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SEEC achieves
state-of-the-art compression ratios while introducing only minimal encoding and
decoding latency. With superior performance, the proposed model also supports
Regions of Interest (ROIs) coding condition on the provided segmentation mask.

Motivation: 中风是全球第二大死因，复发率高且死亡率极高（40%），通过早期识别高风险患者可以有效降低复发率

Method: 收集3D脑部CTA图像数据和临床数据（心脏疾病、年龄、性别），训练单模态和多模态深度学习模型，进行二元复发检测（Task 1）和复发免疑生存时间预测（Task 2）

Result: 多模态XSRD-net模型在测试集上获得c-index 0.68和AUC 0.71，视觉数据占比0.68权重，表格数据占比0.32权重，解释性分析显示心脏疾病和颈动脉形态与中风复发存在关联

Conclusion: 研究成功建立了能够预测中风复发风险的多模态AI模型，发现心脏疾病和颈动脉形态是关键风险因素，为临床预防措施提供了重要依据

Abstract: Stroke is the second most frequent cause of death world wide with an annual
mortality of around 5.5 million. Recurrence rates of stroke are between 5 and
25% in the first year. As mortality rates for relapses are extraordinarily high
(40%) it is of utmost importance to reduce the recurrence rates. We address
this issue by detecting patients at risk of stroke recurrence at an early stage
in order to enable appropriate therapy planning. To this end we collected 3D
intracranial CTA image data and recorded concomitant heart diseases, the age
and the gender of stroke patients between 2010 and 2024. We trained single- and
multimodal deep learning based neural networks for binary relapse detection
(Task 1) and for relapse free survival (RFS) time prediction together with a
subsequent classification (Task 2). The separation of relapse from non-relapse
patients (Task 1) could be solved with tabular data (AUC on test dataset:
0.84). However, for the main task, the regression (Task 2), our multimodal
XSRD-net processed the modalities vision:tabular with 0.68:0.32 according to
modality contribution measures. The c-index with respect to relapses for the
multimodal model reached 0.68, and the AUC is 0.71 for the test dataset. Final,
deeper interpretability analysis results could highlight a link between both
heart diseases (tabular) and carotid arteries (vision) for the detection of
relapses and the prediction of the RFS time. This is a central outcome that we
strive to strengthen with ongoing data collection and model retraining.

Motivation: 虚拟现实和数字人体建模对人类头发重建的需求日益增长，而现有方法常忽略头发拐点的连通性和拓扑结构

Method: 多阶段管线：首先使用可微分高斯柱化器重建详细头发几何，然后通过新的合并方案将单个高斯段合并为一致的发丝，最后在光度监督下精炼和增长发丝

Conclusion: 该方法不仅能够重建详细的头发几何，还能保持发丝的连通性和拓扑结构，为头发重建领域提供了一种新的评估指标

Abstract: Human hair reconstruction is a challenging problem in computer vision, with
growing importance for applications in virtual reality and digital human
modeling. Recent advances in 3D Gaussians Splatting (3DGS) provide efficient
and explicit scene representations that naturally align with the structure of
hair strands. In this work, we extend the 3DGS framework to enable strand-level
hair geometry reconstruction from multi-view images. Our multi-stage pipeline
first reconstructs detailed hair geometry using a differentiable Gaussian
rasterizer, then merges individual Gaussian segments into coherent strands
through a novel merging scheme, and finally refines and grows the strands under
photometric supervision.
  While existing methods typically evaluate reconstruction quality at the
geometric level, they often neglect the connectivity and topology of hair
strands. To address this, we propose a new evaluation metric that serves as a
proxy for assessing topological accuracy in strand reconstruction. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our
method robustly handles a wide range of hairstyles and achieves efficient
reconstruction, typically completing within one hour.

TL;DR: RayGaussX在RayGauss基础上进行优化，通过引入体积渲染加速策略、增强光线一致性、尺度正则化等技术，实现了5-12倍训练加速和50-80倍渲染速度提升，同时提高了视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RayGauss虽然在新视角合成方面达到了最先进的渲染质量，但其计算成本过高，无法在真实场景中实现实时渲染。

Method: 引入体积渲染加速策略（空域跳过和自适应采样）、增强光线一致性、尺度正则化减少误报交点、提出新的致密化准则改善远距离区域密度分布。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上实现了5-12倍训练加速和50-80倍渲染速度提升（FPS），视觉质量提升高达+0.56 dB PSNR。

Conclusion: RayGaussX成功解决了RayGauss的计算效率问题，在保持高质量渲染的同时实现了显著的性能提升，适用于更大场景的实时渲染应用。

Abstract: RayGauss has achieved state-of-the-art rendering quality for novel-view
synthesis on synthetic and indoor scenes by representing radiance and density
fields with irregularly distributed elliptical basis functions, rendered via
volume ray casting using a Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH). However, its
computational cost prevents real-time rendering on real-world scenes. Our
approach, RayGaussX, builds on RayGauss by introducing key contributions that
accelerate both training and inference. Specifically, we incorporate volumetric
rendering acceleration strategies such as empty-space skipping and adaptive
sampling, enhance ray coherence, and introduce scale regularization to reduce
false-positive intersections. Additionally, we propose a new densification
criterion that improves density distribution in distant regions, leading to
enhanced graphical quality on larger scenes. As a result, RayGaussX achieves 5x
to 12x faster training and 50x to 80x higher rendering speeds (FPS) on
real-world datasets while improving visual quality by up to +0.56 dB in PSNR.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自监督的多视角神经网络方法，用于融合两个正交各向异性低分辨率MR图像，无需高分辨率数据即可重建解剖细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医学MR成像中，需要在扫描时间和图像质量之间取得平衡。传统方法需要放射科医生分别分析低分辨率扫描，耗时且可能导致不准确解读。

Method: 使用自监督多视图神经网络，引入稀疏坐标损失来整合任意缩放的低分辨率图像。结合患者无关的离线和患者特定的在线阶段。

Result: 在两个独立队列的MR图像上评估，显示与最先进的自监督超分辨率方法相比具有相当或更好的性能，患者特定重建速度提升高达10倍。

Conclusion: 该方法能够在不依赖高分辨率数据的情况下有效融合多视角低分辨率MR图像，显著提高重建速度同时保持或提升图像质量。

Abstract: Acquiring images in high resolution is often a challenging task. Especially
in the medical sector, image quality has to be balanced with acquisition time
and patient comfort. To strike a compromise between scan time and quality for
Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging, two anisotropic scans with different
low-resolution (LR) orientations can be acquired. Typically, LR scans are
analyzed individually by radiologists, which is time consuming and can lead to
inaccurate interpretation. To tackle this, we propose a novel approach for
fusing two orthogonal anisotropic LR MR images to reconstruct anatomical
details in a unified representation. Our multi-view neural network is trained
in a self-supervised manner, without requiring corresponding high-resolution
(HR) data. To optimize the model, we introduce a sparse coordinate-based loss,
enabling the integration of LR images with arbitrary scaling. We evaluate our
method on MR images from two independent cohorts. Our results demonstrate
comparable or even improved super-resolution (SR) performance compared to
state-of-the-art (SOTA) self-supervised SR methods for different upsampling
scales. By combining a patient-agnostic offline and a patient-specific online
phase, we achieve a substantial speed-up of up to ten times for
patient-specific reconstruction while achieving similar or better SR quality.

TL;DR: SplatFill是一种新颖的深度引导3D高斯溅射场景修复方法，通过联合深度监督和一致性感知细化，实现了最先进的感知质量和更高的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯溅射(3DGS)虽然能从多视角图像创建逼真的3D场景表示，但在修复因遮挡或场景编辑导致的缺失区域时仍存在挑战，往往导致模糊细节、伪影和几何不一致。

Method: 结合两种关键思想：(1)联合深度基和对象基监督，确保修复的高斯点在3D空间中准确定位并与周围几何对齐；(2)提出一致性感知细化方案，选择性识别和修正不一致区域而不破坏场景其他部分。

Result: 在SPIn-NeRF数据集上的评估显示，SplatFill不仅在视觉保真度上超越现有基于NeRF和3DGS的修复方法，还将训练时间减少了24.5%。定性结果显示该方法能提供更清晰的细节、更少的伪影和更好的视角一致性。

Conclusion: SplatFill通过深度引导和一致性感知的联合方法，成功解决了3DGS场景修复中的关键挑战，实现了高质量的修复效果和显著的效率提升。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled the creation of highly realistic 3D
scene representations from sets of multi-view images. However, inpainting
missing regions, whether due to occlusion or scene editing, remains a
challenging task, often leading to blurry details, artifacts, and inconsistent
geometry. In this work, we introduce SplatFill, a novel depth-guided approach
for 3DGS scene inpainting that achieves state-of-the-art perceptual quality and
improved efficiency. Our method combines two key ideas: (1) joint depth-based
and object-based supervision to ensure inpainted Gaussians are accurately
placed in 3D space and aligned with surrounding geometry, and (2) we propose a
consistency-aware refinement scheme that selectively identifies and corrects
inconsistent regions without disrupting the rest of the scene. Evaluations on
the SPIn-NeRF dataset demonstrate that SplatFill not only surpasses existing
NeRF-based and 3DGS-based inpainting methods in visual fidelity but also
reduces training time by 24.5%. Qualitative results show our method delivers
sharper details, fewer artifacts, and greater coherence across challenging
viewpoints.

Motivation: 现有基于LLM的3D物体分割方法存在表示不对齐问题：LLM处理高级语义token而3D点云只有密集几何结构，导致输入输出阶段都需要繁重预对齐且损失细粒度精度

Method: 提出Point Linguist Model (PLM)框架，包含Object-centric Discriminative Representation (OcDR)学习对象中心token捕获目标语义和场景关系，以及Geometric Reactivation Decoder (GRD)结合OcDR token和密集特征进行精确分割

Result: 在ScanNetv2上提升+7.3 mIoU，在Multi3DRefer上提升+6.0 mIoU，在7个基准测试的4个不同任务中均获得一致性能提升

Conclusion: PLM通过全面的对象中心推理实现了鲁棒的3D理解，有效解决了LLM与3D点云之间的表示对齐问题

Abstract: 3D object segmentation with Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a
prevailing paradigm due to its broad semantics, task flexibility, and strong
generalization. However, this paradigm is hindered by representation
misalignment: LLMs process high-level semantic tokens, whereas 3D point clouds
convey only dense geometric structures. In prior methods, misalignment limits
both input and output. At the input stage, dense point patches require heavy
pre-alignment, weakening object-level semantics and confusing similar
distractors. At the output stage, predictions depend only on dense features
without explicit geometric cues, leading to a loss of fine-grained accuracy. To
address these limitations, we present the Point Linguist Model (PLM), a general
framework that bridges the representation gap between LLMs and dense 3D point
clouds without requiring large-scale pre-alignment between 3D-text or
3D-images. Specifically, we introduce Object-centric Discriminative
Representation (OcDR), which learns object-centric tokens that capture target
semantics and scene relations under a hard negative-aware training objective.
This mitigates the misalignment between LLM tokens and 3D points, enhances
resilience to distractors, and facilitates semantic-level reasoning within
LLMs. For accurate segmentation, we introduce the Geometric Reactivation
Decoder (GRD), which predicts masks by combining OcDR tokens carrying
LLM-inferred geometry with corresponding dense features, preserving
comprehensive dense features throughout the pipeline. Extensive experiments
show that PLM achieves significant improvements of +7.3 mIoU on ScanNetv2 and
+6.0 mIoU on Multi3DRefer for 3D referring segmentation, with consistent gains
across 7 benchmarks spanning 4 different tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness
of comprehensive object-centric reasoning for robust 3D understanding.

Conclusion: 通过精细的注意力诊断和动态修正机制，D-LEAF方法能有效解决MLLM中的幻觉问题，为多模态模型的可信度提升提供了有效途径

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on tasks
like image captioning and visual question answering, but remain prone to
hallucinations, where generated text conflicts with the visual input. Prior
work links this partly to insufficient visual attention, but existing
attention-based detectors and mitigation typically apply uniform adjustments
across layers and heads, obscuring where errors originate. In this paper, we
first show these methods fail to accurately localize problematic layers. Then,
we introduce two diagnostics: Layer Image Attention Entropy (LIAE) which flags
anomalous layers, and Image Attention Focus (IAF) which scores attention heads
within those layers. Analysis shows that LIAE pinpoints faulty layers and IAF
reliably ranks heads that warrant correction. Guided by these signals, we
propose Dynamic Layer-wise Entropy and Attention Fusion (D-LEAF), a
task-agnostic, attention-guided method that dynamically localizes and corrects
errors during inference with negligible overhead. Results show our D-LEAF
delivers a 53% relative improvement on standard captioning benchmarks, and on
VQA both accuracy and F1-score improve by approximately 4%, substantially
suppressing hallucinations while preserving efficiency.

Active MINT, we propose a novel multitask learning process that involves
training simultaneously two models: the original or Audited Model, and a
secondary model, referred to as the MINT Model, responsible for identifying the
data used for training the Audited Model. This novel multi-task learning
approach has been designed to incorporate the auditability of the model as an
optimization objective during the training process of neural networks. The
proposed approach incorporates intermediate activation maps as inputs to the
MINT layers, which are trained to enhance the detection of training data. We
present results using a wide range of neural networks, from lighter
architectures such as MobileNet to more complex ones such as Vision
Transformers, evaluated in 5 public benchmarks. Our proposed Active MINT
achieves over 80% accuracy in detecting if given data was used for training,
significantly outperforming previous approaches in the literature. Our aMINT

Motivation: 现有方法主要建立支持目标对象与整个查询图像之间的图像级关联，但这种关联包含难以追踪和抑制的硬像素噪声（不相关的背景对象），导致背景过拟合

Method: 设计了对象级关联网络（OCNet），包含通用对象挖掘模块（GOMM）和关联构建模块（CCM）。GOMM通过学习显著性和高层相似性线索构建查询通用对象特征，CCM通过分配目标原型来匹配通用对象特征建立对象级关联

Conclusion: 通过模仿生物视觉过程建立对象级信息关联，能够有效挖掘查询目标特征并抑制硬像素噪声，在少样本语义分割任务中取得了优异效果

Abstract: Few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) aims to segment objects of novel
categories in the query images given only a few annotated support samples.
Existing methods primarily build the image-level correlation between the
support target object and the entire query image. However, this correlation
contains the hard pixel noise, \textit{i.e.}, irrelevant background objects,
that is intractable to trace and suppress, leading to the overfitting of the
background. To address the limitation of this correlation, we imitate the
biological vision process to identify novel objects in the object-level
information. Target identification in the general objects is more valid than in
the entire image, especially in the low-data regime. Inspired by this, we
design an Object-level Correlation Network (OCNet) by establishing the
object-level correlation between the support target object and query general
objects, which is mainly composed of the General Object Mining Module (GOMM)
and Correlation Construction Module (CCM). Specifically, GOMM constructs the
query general object feature by learning saliency and high-level similarity
cues, where the general objects include the irrelevant background objects and
the target foreground object. Then, CCM establishes the object-level
correlation by allocating the target prototypes to match the general object
feature. The generated object-level correlation can mine the query target
feature and suppress the hard pixel noise for the final prediction. Extensive
experiments on PASCAL-${5}^{i}$ and COCO-${20}^{i}$ show that our model
achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Joint reconstruction of human-object interaction marks a significant
milestone in comprehending the intricate interrelations between humans and
their surrounding environment. Nevertheless, previous optimization methods
often struggle to achieve physically plausible reconstruction results due to
the lack of prior knowledge about human-object interactions. In this paper, we
introduce ScoreHOI, an effective diffusion-based optimizer that introduces
diffusion priors for the precise recovery of human-object interactions. By
harnessing the controllability within score-guided sampling, the diffusion
model can reconstruct a conditional distribution of human and object pose given
the image observation and object feature. During inference, the ScoreHOI
effectively improves the reconstruction results by guiding the denoising
process with specific physical constraints. Furthermore, we propose a
contact-driven iterative refinement approach to enhance the contact
plausibility and improve the reconstruction accuracy. Extensive evaluations on
standard benchmarks demonstrate ScoreHOI's superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its ability to achieve a precise and
robust improvement in joint human-object interaction reconstruction.

*Moo Hyun Son,Juyoung Bae,Zelin Qiu,Jiale Peng,Kai Xin Li,Yifan Lin,Hao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了ToothMCL，首个用于牙齿分割的多模态预训练框架，整合CBCT和IOS数据，在牙齿分割任务上达到最先进性能，DSC指标提升12%（CBCT）和8%（IOS）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有牙齿分割方法缺乏严格验证，性能和临床适用性有限，需要开发更准确的多模态分割方法。

Method: 提出ToothMCL多模态对比学习框架，通过整合CBCT体积数据和IOS表面数据，捕获模态不变表示，实现精确的多类牙齿分割和FDI编号识别。

Result: 在内部和外部测试中均达到最先进性能，CBCT分割DSC提升12%，IOS分割DSC提升8%，在不同成像条件和临床场景下表现出强大泛化能力。

Conclusion: ToothMCL是首个成功的牙齿多模态预训练框架，显著提升了牙齿分割的准确性和临床适用性，为数字牙科提供了可靠的技术基础。

Abstract: Digital dentistry represents a transformative shift in modern dental
practice. The foundational step in this transformation is the accurate digital
representation of the patient's dentition, which is obtained from segmented
Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) and Intraoral Scans (IOS). Despite the
growing interest in digital dental technologies, existing segmentation
methodologies frequently lack rigorous validation and demonstrate limited
performance and clinical applicability. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first work to introduce a multimodal pretraining framework for tooth
segmentation. We present ToothMCL, a Tooth Multimodal Contrastive Learning for
pretraining that integrates volumetric (CBCT) and surface-based (IOS)
modalities. By capturing modality-invariant representations through multimodal
contrastive learning, our approach effectively models fine-grained anatomical
features, enabling precise multi-class segmentation and accurate identification
of F\'ed\'eration Dentaire Internationale (FDI) tooth numbering. Along with the
framework, we curated CBCT-IOS3.8K, the largest paired CBCT and IOS dataset to
date, comprising 3,867 patients. We then evaluated ToothMCL on a comprehensive
collection of independent datasets, representing the largest and most diverse
evaluation to date. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
internal and external testing, with an increase of 12\% for CBCT segmentation
and 8\% for IOS segmentation in the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC).
Furthermore, ToothMCL consistently surpasses existing approaches in tooth
groups and demonstrates robust generalizability across varying imaging
conditions and clinical scenarios.

TL;DR: 通过两次通道适应性推理算法，在消费级硬件上实现实时目标检测速度提升1.85倍，仅付出5.51% mAP损失代价


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前对象检测器在消费级硬件(如RTX 4060笔记本)上的实际性能问题，识别系统级瓶颈是主要限制因素而非计算能力

Method: 提出两次通道适应性推理算法，先使用快速低分辨率通道，仅在检测信心度低时才升级到高分辨率模型通道，无需模型结构改动

Result: 在5000张COCO图片数据集上，方法实现1.85倍速度提升，mAP损失仅为5.51%，超越了PyTorch Early-Exit基线方法

Conclusion: 通过从纯粹模型优化转向硬件感知的推理策略，为消费级设备部署高性能实时AI提供了可复现的实践方案

Abstract: As local AI grows in popularity, there is a critical gap between the
benchmark performance of object detectors and their practical viability on
consumer-grade hardware. While models like YOLOv10s promise real-time speeds,
these metrics are typically achieved on high-power, desktop-class GPUs. This
paper reveals that on resource-constrained systems, such as laptops with RTX
4060 GPUs, performance is not compute-bound but is instead dominated by
system-level bottlenecks, as illustrated by a simple bottleneck test. To
overcome this hardware-level constraint, we introduce a Two-Pass Adaptive
Inference algorithm, a model-independent approach that requires no
architectural changes. This study mainly focuses on adaptive inference
strategies and undertakes a comparative analysis of architectural early-exit
and resolution-adaptive routing, highlighting their respective trade-offs
within a unified evaluation framework. The system uses a fast, low-resolution
pass and only escalates to a high-resolution model pass when detection
confidence is low. On a 5000-image COCO dataset, our method achieves a 1.85x
speedup over a PyTorch Early-Exit baseline, with a modest mAP loss of 5.51%.
This work provides a practical and reproducible blueprint for deploying
high-performance, real-time AI on consumer-grade devices by shifting the focus
from pure model optimization to hardware-aware inference strategies that
maximize throughput.

Conclusion: 研究为动态场景重建评估提供了基准，静态场景下的成功重建表明该方法在无人卫星重建任务中具有潜力。

Abstract: Characterization of uncooperative Resident Space Objects (RSO) play a crucial
role in On-Orbit Servicing (OOS) and Active Debris Removal (ADR) missions to
assess the geometry and motion properties. To address the challenges of
reconstructing tumbling uncooperative targets, this study evaluates the
performance of existing state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction algorithms for
dynamic scenes, focusing on their ability to generate geometrically accurate
models with high-fidelity. To support our evaluation, we developed a simulation
environment using Isaac Sim to generate physics-accurate 2D image sequences of
tumbling satellite under realistic orbital lighting conditions. Our preliminary
results on static scenes using Neuralangelo demonstrate promising
reconstruction quality. The generated 3D meshes closely match the original CAD
models with minimal errors and artifacts when compared using Cloud Compare
(CC). The reconstructed models were able to capture critical fine details for
mission planning. This provides a baseline for our ongoing evaluation of
dynamic scene reconstruction.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于引导扩散模型的解码器，能够生成与用户指定特征高度匹配的图像，用于分析深度神经网络的内部特征空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络的特征提取过程具有黑盒特性，难以理解其内部工作机制。现有研究缺乏能够保证生成图像特征与指定特征紧密匹配的方法。

Method: 使用引导扩散模型，在预训练扩散模型的反向图像生成过程中，通过最小化估计图像特征与用户指定特征之间的欧几里得距离来指导生成过程。

Result: 实验针对CLIP图像编码器、ResNet-50和视觉变换器，生成图像的特征与指定特征高度相似，揭示了这些DNN特征空间的有价值见解。

Conclusion: 该方法无需额外训练即可分析不同DNN的特征空间，在单个商用GPU上运行，为理解神经网络内部特征表示提供了有效工具。

Abstract: One of the key issues in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is the black-box nature
of their internal feature extraction process. Targeting vision-related domains,
this paper focuses on analysing the feature space of a DNN by proposing a
decoder that can generate images whose features are guaranteed to closely match
a user-specified feature. Owing to this guarantee that is missed in past
studies, our decoder allows us to evidence which of various attributes in an
image are encoded into a feature by the DNN, by generating images whose
features are in proximity to that feature. Our decoder is implemented as a
guided diffusion model that guides the reverse image generation of a
pre-trained diffusion model to minimise the Euclidean distance between the
feature of a clean image estimated at each step and the user-specified feature.
One practical advantage of our decoder is that it can analyse feature spaces of
different DNNs with no additional training and run on a single COTS GPU. The
experimental results targeting CLIP's image encoder, ResNet-50 and vision
transformer demonstrate that images generated by our decoder have features
remarkably similar to the user-specified ones and reveal valuable insights into
these DNNs' feature spaces.

TL;DR: OnePoseViaGen是一个从单张参考图像估计任意未见物体6D位姿的先进方法，通过粗到精对齐模块和文本引导生成域随机化策略，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人操作中从单张参考图像估计任意未见物体6D位姿的挑战性问题，包括3D模型稀缺、单视图重建缺乏度量尺度以及生成模型与真实图像之间的域差距。

Method: 采用粗到精对齐模块联合优化尺度和位姿，结合多视图特征匹配和渲染比较细化；使用文本引导生成域随机化策略多样化纹理，支持合成数据有效微调位姿估计器。

Result: 在YCBInEOAT、Toyota-Light、LM-O等挑战性基准测试中达到最先进性能，远超先前方法，并在真实机器人手上展示了稳健的灵巧抓取能力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过高保真单视图3D生成支持可靠的单次6D位姿估计，验证了在实际操作中的实用性，为机器人长尾实例操作提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Estimating the 6D pose of arbitrary unseen objects from a single reference
image is critical for robotics operating in the long-tail of real-world
instances. However, this setting is notoriously challenging: 3D models are
rarely available, single-view reconstructions lack metric scale, and domain
gaps between generated models and real-world images undermine robustness. We
propose OnePoseViaGen, a pipeline that tackles these challenges through two key
components. First, a coarse-to-fine alignment module jointly refines scale and
pose by combining multi-view feature matching with render-and-compare
refinement. Second, a text-guided generative domain randomization strategy
diversifies textures, enabling effective fine-tuning of pose estimators with
synthetic data. Together, these steps allow high-fidelity single-view 3D
generation to support reliable one-shot 6D pose estimation. On challenging
benchmarks (YCBInEOAT, Toyota-Light, LM-O), OnePoseViaGen achieves
state-of-the-art performance far surpassing prior approaches. We further
demonstrate robust dexterous grasping with a real robot hand, validating the
practicality of our method in real-world manipulation. Project page:

TL;DR: VIRAL是一种通过视觉表示对齐来增强多模态大语言模型视觉推理能力的正则化策略，通过将MLLMs的内部视觉表示与预训练视觉基础模型对齐，保留关键视觉细节并补充额外视觉知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在视觉中心任务（如物体计数、空间推理）上表现有限，主要原因是文本监督范式只能提供对视觉通路的间接指导，导致训练过程中丢失细粒度视觉细节。

Method: 提出VIRAL方法，通过正则化策略将MLLMs的内部视觉表示与预训练视觉基础模型的表示进行对齐，从而保留输入视觉编码器的关键视觉细节并补充额外视觉知识。

Result: 实验表明该方法在广泛采用的多模态基准测试的所有任务上都取得了持续改进，并通过全面的消融研究验证了框架的关键设计选择。

Conclusion: 这一简单发现为在训练MLLMs时有效整合视觉信息开辟了重要方向，证明了视觉表示对齐策略的有效性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) trained with visual instruction
tuning have achieved strong performance across diverse tasks, yet they remain
limited in vision-centric tasks such as object counting or spatial reasoning.
We attribute this gap to the prevailing text-only supervision paradigm, which
provides only indirect guidance for the visual pathway and often leads MLLMs to
discard fine-grained visual details during training. In this paper, we present
VIsual Representation ALignment (VIRAL), a simple yet effective regularization
strategy that aligns the internal visual representations of MLLMs with those of
pre-trained vision foundation models (VFMs). By explicitly enforcing this
alignment, VIRAL enables the model not only to retain critical visual details
from the input vision encoder but also to complement additional visual
knowledge from VFMs, thereby enhancing its ability to reason over complex
visual inputs. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across all
tasks on widely adopted multimodal benchmarks. Furthermore, we conduct
comprehensive ablation studies to validate the key design choices underlying
our framework. We believe this simple finding opens up an important direction
for the effective integration of visual information in training MLLMs.

introduce MedBench-IT, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs on
Italian medical university entrance examinations. Sourced from Edizioni Simone,
a leading preparatory materials publisher, MedBench-IT comprises 17,410

Abstract: This study presents a framework for automated evaluation of dynamically
evolving topic models using Large Language Models (LLMs). Topic modeling is
essential for organizing and retrieving scholarly content in digital library
systems, helping users navigate complex and evolving knowledge domains.
However, widely used automated metrics, such as coherence and diversity, often
capture only narrow statistical patterns and fail to explain semantic failures
in practice. We introduce a purpose-oriented evaluation framework that employs
nine LLM-based metrics spanning four key dimensions of topic quality: lexical
validity, intra-topic semantic soundness, inter-topic structural soundness, and
document-topic alignment soundness. The framework is validated through
adversarial and sampling-based protocols, and is applied across datasets
spanning news articles, scholarly publications, and social media posts, as well
as multiple topic modeling methods and open-source LLMs. Our analysis shows
that LLM-based metrics provide interpretable, robust, and task-relevant
assessments, uncovering critical weaknesses in topic models such as redundancy
and semantic drift, which are often missed by traditional metrics. These
results support the development of scalable, fine-grained evaluation tools for
maintaining topic relevance in dynamic datasets. All code and data supporting

Motivation: 现有的LLM基准测试主要关注诊断推理，但忽视了出院后患者教育这一关键环节，需要评估模型在出院沟通中的能力

Method: 创建DischargeSim基准，模拟医生与具有不同心理社会特征的患者之间的多轮对话，评估对话质量、个性化文档生成和患者理解能力

Result: 测试18个LLM模型显示出院教育能力存在显著差距，模型性能因患者特征而异，模型大小并不总是带来更好的教育效果

Conclusion: DischargeSim为评估LLM在临床后访教育中的表现提供了首个基准，有助于促进公平、个性化的患者支持

Abstract: Discharge communication is a critical yet underexplored component of patient
care, where the goal shifts from diagnosis to education. While recent large
language model (LLM) benchmarks emphasize in-visit diagnostic reasoning, they
fail to evaluate models' ability to support patients after the visit. We
introduce DischargeSim, a novel benchmark that evaluates LLMs on their ability
to act as personalized discharge educators. DischargeSim simulates post-visit,
multi-turn conversations between LLM-driven DoctorAgents and PatientAgents with
diverse psychosocial profiles (e.g., health literacy, education, emotion).
Interactions are structured across six clinically grounded discharge topics and
assessed along three axes: (1) dialogue quality via automatic and LLM-as-judge
evaluation, (2) personalized document generation including free-text summaries
and structured AHRQ checklists, and (3) patient comprehension through a
downstream multiple-choice exam. Experiments across 18 LLMs reveal significant
gaps in discharge education capability, with performance varying widely across
patient profiles. Notably, model size does not always yield better education
outcomes, highlighting trade-offs in strategy use and content prioritization.
DischargeSim offers a first step toward benchmarking LLMs in post-visit
clinical education and promoting equitable, personalized patient support.

Motivation: 概率方法在高风险场景中不透明且与透明期望不一致，需要更透明的方法来处理LLM生成文本中的不确定性

Method: 基于道德心理学和美德伦理学，定义预防、尊重、责任等道德规则，并在轻量级Prolog引擎中编码，根据不确定性级别触发对应系统动作

Result: 通过场景模拟测试规则覆盖率、公平性和信任检验，在临床和法律领域的应用案例证明道德推理可以提高信任和可解释性

Conclusion: 该方法为社会责任任的自然语言生成提供了一种透明、轻量级的替代方案，可以替代不透明的概率模型

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in high-stakes settings,
where explaining uncertainty is both technical and ethical. Probabilistic
methods are often opaque and misaligned with expectations of transparency. We
propose a framework based on rule-based moral principles for handling
uncertainty in LLM-generated text. Using insights from moral psychology and
virtue ethics, we define rules such as precaution, deference, and
responsibility to guide responses under epistemic or aleatoric uncertainty.
These rules are encoded in a lightweight Prolog engine, where uncertainty
levels (low, medium, high) trigger aligned system actions with plain-language
rationales. Scenario-based simulations benchmark rule coverage, fairness, and
trust calibration. Use cases in clinical and legal domains illustrate how moral
reasoning can improve trust and interpretability. Our approach offers a
transparent, lightweight alternative to probabilistic models for socially
responsible natural language generation.

Conclusion: LLMs在政治文本分析中具有巨大潜力，德国移民辩论在人口衰退、劳动力短缺和日益两极分化的背景下具有重要意义

Abstract: Migration has been a core topic in German political debate, from millions of
expellees post World War II over labor migration to refugee movements in the
recent past. Studying political speech regarding such wide-ranging phenomena in
depth traditionally required extensive manual annotations, limiting the scope
of analysis to small subsets of the data. Large language models (LLMs) have the
potential to partially automate even complex annotation tasks. We provide an
extensive evaluation of a multiple LLMs in annotating (anti-)solidarity
subtypes in German parliamentary debates compared to a large set of thousands
of human reference annotations (gathered over a year). We evaluate the
influence of model size, prompting differences, fine-tuning, historical versus
contemporary data; and we investigate systematic errors. Beyond methodological
evaluation, we also interpret the resulting annotations from a social science
lense, gaining deeper insight into (anti-)solidarity trends towards migrants in
the German post-World War II period and recent past. Our data reveals a high
degree of migrant-directed solidarity in the postwar period, as well as a
strong trend towards anti-solidarity in the German parliament since 2015,
motivating further research. These findings highlight the promise of LLMs for
political text analysis and the importance of migration debates in Germany,
where demographic decline and labor shortages coexist with rising polarization.

*Zhuoqing Song,Peng Sun,Huizhuo Yuan,Quanquan Gu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CASTLE是一种新颖的注意力机制，通过动态更新每个token的key来整合后续信息，同时保持自回归特性，在语言建模任务中显著优于标准因果注意力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准因果注意力中每个token的QKV是静态的，只编码前文信息，限制了模型对完整上下文的利用能力

Method: 提出CASTLE机制，持续更新每个token的key以整合后续token信息，通过数学等价性实现并行训练，避免显式存储lookahead keys

Result: 在语言建模基准测试中，CASTLE在不同模型规模下均优于标准因果注意力，降低了验证困惑度并提升了下游任务性能

Conclusion: 动态更新key的注意力机制能有效提升语言模型性能，同时保持自回归特性，为注意力机制设计提供了新思路

Abstract: In standard causal attention, each token's query, key, and value (QKV) are
static and encode only preceding context. We introduce CAuSal aTtention with
Lookahead kEys (CASTLE), an attention mechanism that continually updates each
token's keys as the context unfolds. We term these updated keys lookahead keys
because they belong to earlier positions yet integrate information from tokens
that appear later relative to those positions, while strictly preserving the
autoregressive property. Although the mechanism appears sequential, we derive a
mathematical equivalence that avoids explicitly materializing lookahead keys at
each position and enables efficient parallel training. On language modeling
benchmarks, CASTLE consistently outperforms standard causal attention across
model scales, reducing validation perplexity and improving performance on a
range of downstream tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于语言嵌入的BVM方法，用于判断图像状态变化，在名词分类上表现优于其他指标，但在形容词区分上不如逻辑回归模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种新的方法来评估图像状态变化，利用语言嵌入技术来更好地理解和分类名词-形容词组合所表示的状态。

Method: 使用BVM（基向量方法）处理MIT-States数据集中的53,000张图像，包含225个名词和115个形容词组成的约1000个名词-形容词对。与余弦相似度、点积、乘积量化、二进制索引、朴素贝叶斯和自定义神经网络进行比较。

Result: BVM在名词状态分类方面表现最佳，但在形容词区分方面未能超越逻辑回归模型。

Conclusion: BVM在名词分类任务上有效，但在形容词区分方面需要方法改进以提高准确性。

Abstract: We test a new method, which we will abbreviate using the acronym BVM (Basis
Vectors Method), in its ability to judge the state changes in images through
using language embeddings. We used the MIT-States dataset, containing about
53,000 images, to gather all of our data, which has 225 nouns and 115
adjectives, with each noun having about 9 different adjectives, forming
approximately 1000 noun-adjective pairs. For our first experiment, we test our
method's ability to determine the state of each noun class separately against
other metrics for comparison. These metrics are cosine similarity, dot product,
product quantization, binary index, Naive Bayes, and a custom neural network.
Among these metrics, we found that our proposed BVM performs the best in
classifying the states for each noun. We then perform a second experiment where
we try using BVM to determine if it can differentiate adjectives from one
another for each adjective separately. We compared the abilities of BVM to
differentiate adjectives against the proposed method the MIT-States paper
suggests: using a logistic regression model. In the end, we did not find
conclusive evidence that our BVM metric could perform better than the logistic
regression model at discerning adjectives. Yet, we were able to find evidence
for possible improvements to our method; this leads to the chance of increasing
our method's accuracy through certain changes in our methodologies.

Motivation: 为长文本生成任务建立一个标准化的性能预测基准，解决多维度、细粒度评估指标的预测问题，支持黑盒模型输入输出的性能预测需求。

Method: 采用任务、模型和指标无关的方式，基于黑盒模型的输入和输出来预测连续的评估指标分数。方法包括点估计和预测区间的推断，以量化预测的不确定性。

Result: 在11个长文本生成数据集上进行了评估，包括多个大语言模型、基准方法和多个指标。结果显示，仅需16个训练示例就可以在各种长文本生成任务上实现有效的分数预测。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一个新题的且实用的任务，为推动进步提供了价值较高的基准，并且现有基线方法已经可以实际应用。

Abstract: We motivate and share a new benchmark for instance-level performance
prediction of long-form generation tasks having multi-faceted, fine-grained
quality metrics. Our task-, model- and metric-agnostic formulation predicts
continuous evaluation metric scores given only black-box model inputs and
outputs. Beyond predicting point estimates of metric scores, the benchmark also
requires inferring prediction intervals to quantify uncertainty around point
estimates. Evaluation spans 11 long-form datasets/tasks with multiple LLMs,
baselines, and metrics per task. We show that scores can be effectively
predicted across long-form generation tasks using as few as 16 training
examples. Overall, we introduce a novel and useful task, a valuable benchmark
to drive progress, and baselines ready for practical adoption today.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KAMIR是一种基于模型内部表示的数据选择方法，通过分析隐藏状态相似度来评估数据，无需提示工程即可选择对训练有用的陌生数据


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SFT训练数据选择缺乏明确方法的问题，现有基于知识的选择方法依赖提示工程且成本高，需要更有效的数据选择技术

Method: KAMIR通过计算每层隐藏状态与最终隐藏状态的相似度来分析数据，基于模型对输入的熟悉程度选择训练数据

Result: 实验表明使用较不熟悉的数据进行训练能获得更好的泛化性能，方法适用于多种任务类型

Conclusion: KAMIR提供了一种有效的数据选择方法，不依赖提示工程，能选择提升模型泛化能力的训练数据

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have been driven by
pretraining, supervised fine tuning (SFT), and alignment tuning. Among these,
SFT plays a crucial role in transforming a model 's general knowledge into
structured responses tailored to specific tasks. However, there is no clearly
established methodology for effective training data selection. Simply
increasing the volume of data does not guarantee performance improvements,
while preprocessing, sampling, and validation require substantial time and
cost.
  To address this issue, a variety of data selection methods have been
proposed. Among them, knowledge based selection approaches identify suitable
training data by analyzing the model 's responses. Nevertheless, these methods
typically rely on prompt engineering, making them sensitive to variations and
incurring additional costs for prompt design.
  In this study, we propose Knowledge Analysis via Model Internal
Representations (KAMIR), a novel approach that overcomes these limitations by
analyzing data based on the model 's internal representations. KAMIR computes
similarities between the hidden states of each layer (block) and the final
hidden states for a given input to assess the data. Unlike prior methods that
were largely limited to multiple choice tasks, KAMIR can be applied to a wide
range of tasks such as machine reading comprehension and summarization.
Moreover, it selects data useful for training based on the model 's familiarity
with the input, even with a small dataset and a simple classifier architecture.
Experiments across diverse task datasets demonstrate that training with less
familiar data leads to better generalization performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer自注意力机制存在局部化问题，注意力集中在有限token子集上，难以捕获长距离依赖关系

Method: 提出Self-Attention One-step Belief Propagation (SAOBP)框架，通过信念传播过程注入多跳关系，并引入Global Token Dependency (GTD)指标来量化和解释这些交互

Result: SAOBP有助于防止深层网络中的熵崩溃，自适应地将GTD维持在任务适当水平，支持模型性能提升，特别在小规模模型中观察到竞争优势

Conclusion: SAOBP框架有效解决了注意力局部化问题，通过多跳关系注入改善了长距离依赖捕获能力，在资源受限场景下具有提升推理质量的潜力

Abstract: Transformer-based self-attention mechanism serves as the core of modern
language models, yet it often suffers from localization, where attentions
collapse onto a limited subset of tokens and fail to capture long-range
dependencies. To address this issue, we propose Self-Attention One-step Belief
Propagation (SAOBP), a refinement framework that injects multi-hop
relationships through a belief propagation process. To interpret and quantify
these interactions, we introduce Global Token Dependency (GTD) that captures
the relative contribution of multihop connections within the attention graph.
Empirical results indicate that SAOBP helps prevent entropy collapse in deeper
layers and adaptively maintains GTD at task-appropriate levels, thereby
supporting improvements in model performance. Importantly, we observe
competitive gains in small-scale models, highlighting its potential for
improving inference quality in resource-constrained scenarios.

TL;DR: PersonaFuse是一个新颖的LLM后训练框架，通过混合专家架构和动态路由网络，使LLM能够根据不同情境适应和表达不同个性，显著提升社交情感智能而不损害通用推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在现实对话中表现出情感感知和社交能力的局限性，无法根据不同的社交和任务情境调整沟通风格和情感表达。

Method: 基于特质激活理论和大五人格模型，采用混合专家架构，结合个性适配器和动态路由网络，实现情境化特质表达。

Result: 在社交情感智能多个维度上显著优于基线模型，在下游人本应用（如心理健康咨询和客服）中持续改进，人类偏好评估显示与领先LLM竞争。

Conclusion: PersonaFuse为开发社交情感增强型LLM提供了理论基础和实用方法，是迈向更人本AI系统的重要进展。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities across various fields. These developments have led to more direct
communication between humans and LLMs in various situations, such as social
companionship and psychological support. However, LLMs often exhibit
limitations in emotional perception and social competence during real-world
conversations. These limitations partly originate from their inability to adapt
their communication style and emotional expression to different social and task
contexts. In this work, we introduce PersonaFuse, a novel LLM post-training
framework that enables LLMs to adapt and express different personalities for
varying situations. Inspired by Trait Activation Theory and the Big Five
personality model, PersonaFuse employs a Mixture-of-Expert architecture that
combines persona adapters with a dynamic routing network, enabling contextual
trait expression. Experimental results show that PersonaFuse substantially
outperforms baseline models across multiple dimensions of social-emotional
intelligence. Importantly, these gains are achieved without sacrificing general
reasoning ability or model safety, which remain common limitations of direct
prompting and supervised fine-tuning approaches. PersonaFuse also delivers
consistent improvements in downstream human-centered applications, such as
mental health counseling and review-based customer service. Finally, human
preference evaluations against leading LLMs, including GPT-4o and DeepSeek,
demonstrate that PersonaFuse achieves competitive response quality despite its
comparatively smaller model size. These findings demonstrate that
PersonaFuse~offers a theoretically grounded and practical approach for
developing social-emotional enhanced LLMs, marking a significant advancement
toward more human-centric AI systems.

Motivation: 评估大语言模型是否能像人类一样通过模式识别和交互反馈学习语言，这是人类语言获得的核心特征

Method: 构建新语言Tinkatongue，让LLM代理与只理解该语言的机器人进行对话，评估其学习和使用新语言的能力

Result: LLM代理在100次回应内无法建立有效对话，但采用了类似人类语言学习的策略

Conclusion: 需要新的评测标准，并开启了从交互反馈中更有效学习的模型设计方向

Abstract: Existing evaluation studies on linguistic competence of large language models
(LLM agents) have focused primarily on vocabulary learning, morphological rule
induction, syntactic generalization, pragmatic inference, and cross-linguistic
transfer. However, none assess whether LLM agents can acquire a language
through pattern recognition and interactive feedback, a central feature of
human language acquisition. We propose a novel experimental framework in which
an LLM agent is evaluated on its ability to acquire and use a newly constructed
language (Tinkatongue) in conversation with a bot that understands only
Tinkatongue. Our findings show that LLM agents fail to establish a conversation
within 100 responses, yet they adopt distinct strategies that mirror human
approaches to language learning. The results suggest a new direction for
evaluation benchmarks and open pathways to model designs that learn more
effectively from interactive feedback.

Abstract: Integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) into the reasoning processes of large
language models (LLMs) has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate
hallucination. However, existing work in this area often relies on proprietary
or extremely large models, limiting accessibility and scalability. In this
study, we investigate the capabilities of existing integration methods for
small language models (SLMs) in KG-based question answering and observe that
their performance is often constrained by their limited ability to traverse and
reason over knowledge graphs. To address this limitation, we propose leveraging
simple and efficient exploration modules to handle knowledge graph traversal in
place of the language model itself. Experiment results demonstrate that these
lightweight modules effectively improve the performance of small language
models on knowledge graph question answering tasks. Source code:

Method: 构建LongEmotion基准测试，包含情感分类、检测、问答、对话、摘要和表达6类任务。提出两种方法：1）RAG方法利用对话上下文和LLM本身作为检索源；2）CoEM方法将任务分解为5个阶段，整合检索增强和有限知识注入。

Result: 实验结果显示RAG和CoEM方法在大多数长上下文任务中都能持续提升情感智能相关性能。对GPT系列模型的比较案例研究显示了不同模型在情感智能方面的差异。

Conclusion: 该研究推进了LLMs在更实用和现实世界情感智能应用方面的发展，LongEmotion基准测试为长上下文情感智能评估提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) make significant progress in Emotional
Intelligence (EI) and long-context understanding. However, existing benchmarks
tend to overlook certain aspects of EI in long-context scenarios, especially
under realistic, practical settings where interactions are lengthy, diverse,
and often noisy. To move towards such realistic settings, we present
LongEmotion, a benchmark specifically designed for long-context EI tasks. It
covers a diverse set of tasks, including Emotion Classification, Emotion
Detection, Emotion QA, Emotion Conversation, Emotion Summary, and Emotion
Expression. On average, the input length for these tasks reaches 8,777 tokens,
with long-form generation required for Emotion Expression. To enhance
performance under realistic constraints, we incorporate Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) and Collaborative Emotional Modeling (CoEM), and compare them
with standard prompt-based methods. Unlike conventional approaches, our RAG
method leverages both the conversation context and the large language model
itself as retrieval sources, avoiding reliance on external knowledge bases. The
CoEM method further improves performance by decomposing the task into five
stages, integrating both retrieval augmentation and limited knowledge
injection. Experimental results show that both RAG and CoEM consistently
enhance EI-related performance across most long-context tasks, advancing LLMs
toward more practical and real-world EI applications. Furthermore, we conducted
a comparative case study experiment on the GPT series to demonstrate the
differences among various models in terms of EI. Code is available on GitHub at

GBERT, Qwen3 Embedding, and XLM-RoBERTa. We find that a multilingual
XLM-RoBERTa-Large model trained to detect candy speech at the span level
outperforms other approaches, ranking first in both binary positive F1: 0.8906)
and categorized span-based detection (strict F1: 0.6307) subtasks at the

Method: 通过系统文献检索识别现有污名化语言词典，进行对比分析：1）词典间的相似性和差异；2）基于既定情感数据集的正面、负面或中性术语分布。

Result: 识别出4个词典，分析显示它们具有中等语义相似性，大多数污名化术语涉及临床医生对感知负面行为的评判性表达。情感分析显示主要为负面分类词汇，但不同词典间存在差异。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了标准化污名化语言词典的必要性，并突显了在临床文本中定义污名化语言所面临的挑战。

Abstract: Stigmatizing language results in healthcare inequities, yet there is no
universally accepted or standardized lexicon defining which words, terms, or
phrases constitute stigmatizing language in healthcare. We conducted a
systematic search of the literature to identify existing stigmatizing language
lexicons and then analyzed them comparatively to examine: 1) similarities and
discrepancies between these lexicons, and 2) the distribution of positive,
negative, or neutral terms based on an established sentiment dataset. Our
search identified four lexicons. The analysis results revealed moderate
semantic similarity among them, and that most stigmatizing terms are related to
judgmental expressions by clinicians to describe perceived negative behaviors.
Sentiment analysis showed a predominant proportion of negatively classified
terms, though variations exist across lexicons. Our findings underscore the
need for a standardized lexicon and highlight challenges in defining
stigmatizing language in clinical texts.

Abstract: Detecting content that contradicts or is unsupported by a given source text
is a critical challenge for the safe deployment of generative language models.
We introduce HALT-RAG, a post-hoc verification system designed to identify
hallucinations in the outputs of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
pipelines. Our flexible and task-adaptable framework uses a universal feature
set derived from an ensemble of two frozen, off-the-shelf Natural Language
Inference (NLI) models and lightweight lexical signals. These features are used
to train a simple, calibrated, and task-adapted meta-classifier. Using a
rigorous 5-fold out-of-fold (OOF) training protocol to prevent data leakage and
produce unbiased estimates, we evaluate our system on the HaluEval benchmark.
By pairing our universal feature set with a lightweight, task-adapted
classifier and a precision-constrained decision policy, HALT-RAG achieves
strong OOF F1-scores of 0.7756, 0.9786, and 0.7391 on the summarization, QA,
and dialogue tasks, respectively. The system's well-calibrated probabilities
enable a practical abstention mechanism, providing a reliable tool for

Method: 提出三阶段主动学习框架：1）使用不同策略选择信息样本 2）构建真实检索语料库 3）用于LLM上下文学习。通过三种不同的主动学习策略顺序选择样本

Conclusion: ALLabel框架有效降低了LLM实体识别的标注成本，验证了该方法的有效性和泛化能力，为科学领域实体识别提供了高效的解决方案

Abstract: Many contemporary data-driven research efforts in the natural sciences, such
as chemistry and materials science, require large-scale, high-performance
entity recognition from scientific datasets. Large language models (LLMs) have
increasingly been adopted to solve the entity recognition task, with the same
trend being observed on all-spectrum NLP tasks. The prevailing entity
recognition LLMs rely on fine-tuned technology, yet the fine-tuning process
often incurs significant cost. To achieve a best performance-cost trade-off, we
propose ALLabel, a three-stage framework designed to select the most
informative and representative samples in preparing the demonstrations for LLM
modeling. The annotated examples are used to construct a ground-truth retrieval
corpus for LLM in-context learning. By sequentially employing three distinct
active learning strategies, ALLabel consistently outperforms all baselines
under the same annotation budget across three specialized domain datasets.
Experimental results also demonstrate that selectively annotating only 5\%-10\%
of the dataset with ALLabel can achieve performance comparable to the method
annotating the entire dataset. Further analyses and ablation studies verify the
effectiveness and generalizability of our proposal.

Method: 采用两阶段学习范式，在正常条件下自主执行动作，在不可信场景下主动向人类查询，实现元知识的解耦和利用

Result: 在不可信场景下比最先进方法平均步骤成功率提高20.64%，且不影响正常性能表现

Conclusion: VeriOS-Agent展示了合理性、泛化性和可扩展性，为可信操作系统代理提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: With the rapid progress of multimodal large language models, operating system
(OS) agents become increasingly capable of automating tasks through on-device
graphical user interfaces (GUIs). However, most existing OS agents are designed
for idealized settings, whereas real-world environments often present
untrustworthy conditions. To mitigate risks of over-execution in such
scenarios, we propose a query-driven human-agent-GUI interaction framework that
enables OS agents to decide when to query humans for more reliable task
completion. Built upon this framework, we introduce VeriOS-Agent, a trustworthy
OS agent trained with a two-stage learning paradigm that falicitate the
decoupling and utilization of meta-knowledge. Concretely, VeriOS-Agent
autonomously executes actions in normal conditions while proactively querying
humans in untrustworthy scenarios. Experiments show that VeriOS-Agent improves
the average step-wise success rate by 20.64\% in untrustworthy scenarios over
the state-of-the-art, without compromising normal performance. Analysis
highlights VeriOS-Agent's rationality, generalizability, and scalability. The

TL;DR: 提出IRAKE方法解决检索增强知识编辑在多跳问答中的编辑跳过问题，通过引导分解和迭代检索提升编辑效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型知识快速过时，重新训练成本高，现有RAG方法在简单知识编辑表现好但在多跳问答中存在编辑跳过问题

Method: IRAKE方法，通过单编辑事实和完整编辑案例的引导进行迭代检索增强知识编辑，解决粒度不匹配和语言表达多样性问题

Result: 实验结果表明IRAKE有效缓解编辑跳过导致的编辑失败，在多跳问答知识编辑任务上优于现有最优方法

Conclusion: IRAKE通过引导分解和迭代检索机制成功解决了多跳问答中的知识编辑挑战，为知识更新提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: In a rapidly evolving world where information updates swiftly, knowledge in
large language models (LLMs) becomes outdated quickly. Retraining LLMs is not a
cost-effective option, making knowledge editing (KE) without modifying
parameters particularly necessary. We find that although existing
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based KE methods excel at editing simple
knowledge, they struggle with KE in multi-hop question answering due to the
issue of "edit skipping", which refers to skipping the relevant edited fact in
inference. In addition to the diversity of natural language expressions of
knowledge, edit skipping also arises from the mismatch between the granularity
of LLMs in problem-solving and the facts in the edited memory. To address this
issue, we propose a novel Iterative Retrieval-Augmented Knowledge Editing
method with guided decomposition (IRAKE) through the guidance from single
edited facts and entire edited cases. Experimental results demonstrate that
IRAKE mitigates the failure of editing caused by edit skipping and outperforms
state-of-the-art methods for KE in multi-hop question answering.

TL;DR: BALI是一种新颖的联合语言模型和知识图谱预训练方法，通过同时学习专用KG编码器和对齐LM与图谱表示，将外部知识增强到语言模型中，提升生物医学文本理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生物医学LLMs在理解复杂领域特定概念结构和生物医学知识图谱中的事实信息方面表现有限，需要更好的方法来整合外部知识。

Method: 提出BALI方法：将文本中的生物医学概念链接到UMLS知识图谱，利用局部KG子图作为跨模态正样本，同时训练KG编码器并对齐LM和图谱表示。

Result: 在PubMedBERT和BioLinkBERT等主流生物医学LM上实施该方法，即使在小规模PubMed摘要数据集上进行最小预训练，也能显著提升语言理解任务性能和实体表示质量。

Conclusion: BALI方法有效增强了生物医学语言模型的知识理解能力，证明了联合LM和KG预训练在生物医学领域的实用价值。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been substantial progress in using pretrained
Language Models (LMs) on a range of tasks aimed at improving the understanding
of biomedical texts. Nonetheless, existing biomedical LLMs show limited
comprehension of complex, domain-specific concept structures and the factual
information encoded in biomedical Knowledge Graphs (KGs). In this work, we
propose BALI (Biomedical Knowledge Graph and Language Model Alignment), a novel
joint LM and KG pre-training method that augments an LM with external knowledge
by the simultaneous learning of a dedicated KG encoder and aligning the
representations of both the LM and the graph. For a given textual sequence, we
link biomedical concept mentions to the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS)
KG and utilize local KG subgraphs as cross-modal positive samples for these
mentions. Our empirical findings indicate that implementing our method on
several leading biomedical LMs, such as PubMedBERT and BioLinkBERT, improves
their performance on a range of language understanding tasks and the quality of
entity representations, even with minimal pre-training on a small alignment
dataset sourced from PubMed scientific abstracts.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种迭代自我提示技术，通过使用大语言模型生成任务特定提示并通过少样本学习精炼，用于临床报呆摘要任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床报呆通常长繁且充满专业术语，导致领域专家难以高效识别文档中的重要信息，影响医患沟通和共同决策。

Method: 采用迭代自我提示技术，让LLM生成任务特定提示并通过示例小样本学习进行精炼，使用ROUGE和BERT-score指标指导模型微调。

Result: 在3,396份多专科临床案例报呆上，方法在GPT-4和GPT-4o上获得了ROUGE分数(46.53, 24.68, 30.77)和BERTscore(87.84, 83.25, 85.46)，高BERTscore表明生成了语义等价的摘要。

Conclusion: 视角敏感的迭代自我提示技术可以有效应用于临床报呆摘要，支持更好的医患沟通。

Abstract: Efficient communication between patients and clinicians plays an important
role in shared decision-making. However, clinical reports are often lengthy and
filled with clinical jargon, making it difficult for domain experts to identify
important aspects in the document efficiently. This paper presents the
methodology we applied in the MultiClinSUM shared task for summarising clinical
case documents. We used an Iterative Self-Prompting technique on large language
models (LLMs) by asking LLMs to generate task-specific prompts and refine them
via example-based few-shot learning. Furthermore, we used lexical and embedding
space metrics, ROUGE and BERT-score, to guide the model fine-tuning with
epochs. Our submission using perspective-aware ISP on GPT-4 and GPT-4o achieved
ROUGE scores (46.53, 24.68, 30.77) and BERTscores (87.84, 83.25, 85.46) for (P,
R, F1) from the official evaluation on 3,396 clinical case reports from various
specialties extracted from open journals. The high BERTscore indicates that the
model produced semantically equivalent output summaries compared to the
references, even though the overlap at the exact lexicon level is lower, as
reflected in the lower ROUGE scores. This work sheds some light on how
perspective-aware ISP (PA-ISP) can be deployed for clinical report
summarisation and support better communication between patients and clinicians.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将文档转为文本处理会丢失多模态信息，而大型视觉语言模型受限于输入长度无法处理多页文档。现有检索方法仅依赖语义相关性，忽略了页面间的逻辑连接对推理的重要性

Method: 构建页面图捕获页面间上下文关系，使用轻量级视觉语言模型进行图遍历检索相关页面，结合语义和逻辑相关性，提供训练免费和微调两种变体

Result: 在四个DocQA数据集上平均准确率比LVLM直接推理提升9.68%，检索精度比基线方法提升7.44%

Conclusion: MoLoRAG通过逻辑感知的检索框架有效解决了多模态多页文档理解中的检索问题，结合语义和逻辑相关性显著提升了文档问答性能

Abstract: Document Understanding is a foundational AI capability with broad
applications, and Document Question Answering (DocQA) is a key evaluation task.
Traditional methods convert the document into text for processing by Large
Language Models (LLMs), but this process strips away critical multi-modal
information like figures. While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) address
this limitation, their constrained input size makes multi-page document
comprehension infeasible. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods mitigate
this by selecting relevant pages, but they rely solely on semantic relevance,
ignoring logical connections between pages and the query, which is essential
for reasoning.
  To this end, we propose MoLoRAG, a logic-aware retrieval framework for
multi-modal, multi-page document understanding. By constructing a page graph
that captures contextual relationships between pages, a lightweight VLM
performs graph traversal to retrieve relevant pages, including those with
logical connections often overlooked. This approach combines semantic and
logical relevance to deliver more accurate retrieval. After retrieval, the
top-$K$ pages are fed into arbitrary LVLMs for question answering. To enhance
flexibility, MoLoRAG offers two variants: a training-free solution for easy
deployment and a fine-tuned version to improve logical relevance checking.
Experiments on four DocQA datasets demonstrate average improvements of 9.68% in
accuracy over LVLM direct inference and 7.44% in retrieval precision over
baselines. Codes and datasets are released at
https://github.com/WxxShirley/MoLoRAG.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了M-BRe框架，通过关系分组、关系提取和标签决策三个模块，结合多分类和二分类的优势，从无标注文本中自动提取高质量的关系抽取训练样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 关系抽取任务中手动标注训练数据成本高昂，目标关系在文本中稀少且难以发现。LLMs在多分类设置下难以全面捕捉每个关系的语义，而二分类方法计算开销过大，需要一种高效的方法来自动提取训练实例。

Method: M-BRe框架包含三个模块：1）关系分组模块将相似关系聚类；2）关系提取模块进行多分类提取；3）标签决策模块使用二分类验证和精炼结果，结合两种分类方法的优势。

Result: 大量实验证实该框架能够从无标注文本中发现高质量的关系抽取训练样本，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: M-BRe框架有效解决了LLMs在关系抽取中的语义捕捉不全面和计算开销大的问题，为自动提取训练数据提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: For Relation Extraction (RE), the manual annotation of training data may be
prohibitively expensive, since the sentences that contain the target relations
in texts can be very scarce and difficult to find. It is therefore beneficial
to develop an efficient method that can automatically extract training
instances from unlabeled texts for training RE models. Recently, large language
models (LLMs) have been adopted in various natural language processing tasks,
with RE also benefiting from their advances. However, when leveraging LLMs for
RE with predefined relation categories, two key challenges arise. First, in a
multi-class classification setting, LLMs often struggle to comprehensively
capture the semantics of every relation, leading to suboptimal results. Second,
although employing binary classification for each relation individually can
mitigate this issue, it introduces significant computational overhead,
resulting in impractical time complexity for real-world applications.
Therefore, this paper proposes a framework called M-BRe to extract training
instances from unlabeled texts for RE. It utilizes three modules to combine the
advantages of both of the above classification approaches: Relation Grouping,
Relation Extraction, and Label Decision. Extensive experiments confirm its
superior capability in discovering high-quality training samples from unlabeled
texts for RE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在医学等敏感领域的应用，水印技术的可靠性和安全性需要在医学上下文中进行评估

Method: 提出了一个医学专门的评估流程，结合评估事实准确性和语义连贯性，使用GPT-Judger和人工验证，并引入事实性加权分数(FWS)综合指标

Result: 当前水印方法在医学领域会导致事实性明显降低，熵准移动会残好医学实体表达

Conclusion: 医学领域需要具有领域知识的水印方案，以确保医学内容的整体性和准确性

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) adapted to sensitive domains such as
medicine, their fluency raises safety risks, particularly regarding provenance
and accountability. Watermarking embeds detectable patterns to mitigate these
risks, yet its reliability in medical contexts remains untested. Existing
benchmarks focus on detection-quality tradeoffs, overlooking factual risks
under low-entropy settings often exploited by watermarking's reweighting
strategy. We propose a medical-focused evaluation workflow that jointly
assesses factual accuracy and coherence. Using GPT-Judger and further human
validation, we introduce the Factuality-Weighted Score (FWS), a composite
metric prioritizing factual accuracy beyond coherence to guide watermarking
deployment in medical domains. Our evaluation shows current watermarking
methods substantially compromise medical factuality, with entropy shifts
degrading medical entity representation. These findings underscore the need for
domain-aware watermarking approaches that preserve the integrity of medical
content.

TL;DR: 本研究对大型语言模型在虚假新闻、有害内容和政治偏见检测方面的性能进行了全面基准测试，涵盖10个数据集和5种语言，比较了微调与上下文学习的不同策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线平台上虚假新闻、极化内容和有害内容的传播已成为严重问题，但缺乏对不同大语言模型、使用方法和语言性能的系统性基准研究。

Method: 实验涵盖10个数据集和5种语言（英语、西班牙语、葡萄牙语、阿拉伯语和保加利亚语），测试了参数高效微调、零样本提示、代码本、少样本学习（随机选择和多样性选择）以及思维链等不同策略。

Result: 研究发现上下文学习通常表现不如微调，即使是较小的微调模型也比最大的上下文学习模型（如LlaMA3.1-8b-Instruct、Mistral-Nemo-Instruct-2407和Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct）表现更好。

Conclusion: 微调在任务特定设置中的重要性被凸显，即使与最大的上下文学习模型相比，对较小模型进行微调也能获得更好的性能。

Abstract: The spread of fake news, polarizing, politically biased, and harmful content
on online platforms has been a serious concern. With large language models
becoming a promising approach, however, no study has properly benchmarked their
performance across different models, usage methods, and languages. This study
presents a comprehensive overview of different Large Language Models adaptation
paradigms for the detection of hyperpartisan and fake news, harmful tweets, and
political bias. Our experiments spanned 10 datasets and 5 different languages
(English, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic and Bulgarian), covering both binary and
multiclass classification scenarios. We tested different strategies ranging
from parameter efficient Fine-Tuning of language models to a variety of
different In-Context Learning strategies and prompts. These included zero-shot
prompts, codebooks, few-shot (with both randomly-selected and
diversely-selected examples using Determinantal Point Processes), and
Chain-of-Thought. We discovered that In-Context Learning often underperforms
when compared to Fine-Tuning a model. This main finding highlights the
importance of Fine-Tuning even smaller models on task-specific settings even
when compared to the largest models evaluated in an In-Context Learning setup -
in our case LlaMA3.1-8b-Instruct, Mistral-Nemo-Instruct-2407 and
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct.

Abstract: Structured information extraction from scientific literature is crucial for
capturing core concepts and emerging trends in specialized fields. While
existing datasets aid model development, most focus on specific publication
sections due to domain complexity and the high cost of annotating scientific
texts. To address this limitation, we introduce SciNLP - a specialized
benchmark for full-text entity and relation extraction in the Natural Language
Processing (NLP) domain. The dataset comprises 60 manually annotated full-text
NLP publications, covering 7,072 entities and 1,826 relations. Compared to
existing research, SciNLP is the first dataset providing full-text annotations
of entities and their relationships in the NLP domain. To validate the
effectiveness of SciNLP, we conducted comparative experiments with similar
datasets and evaluated the performance of state-of-the-art supervised models on
this dataset. Results reveal varying extraction capabilities of existing models
across academic texts of different lengths. Cross-comparisons with existing
datasets show that SciNLP achieves significant performance improvements on
certain baseline models. Using models trained on SciNLP, we implemented
automatic construction of a fine-grained knowledge graph for the NLP domain.
Our KG has an average node degree of 3.2 per entity, indicating rich semantic
topological information that enhances downstream applications. The dataset is
publicly available at https://github.com/AKADDC/SciNLP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在两个主要局限：1）忽视非结构化评论知识；2）未充分利用大语言模型。因此需要充分利用双重知识和大语言模型来促进多模态对话系统的文本响应生成。

Method: 提出双知识增强的两阶段推理器DK2R：首先从外部知识库提取结构化和非结构化知识；然后使用LLM评估每种知识类型的效用；最后通过专门的推理分别总结意图导向的关键线索，作为辅助信号增强基于LLM的文本响应生成。

Result: 在公共数据集上进行的大量实验验证了DK2R的优越性。

Conclusion: DK2R方法通过有效整合双重知识和LLM能力，成功解决了动态知识类型选择和意图-响应解耦两个关键挑战，显著提升了多模态任务导向对话系统的性能。

Abstract: Textual response generation is pivotal for multimodal \mbox{task-oriented}
dialog systems, which aims to generate proper textual responses based on the
multimodal context. While existing efforts have demonstrated remarkable
progress, there still exist the following limitations: 1) \textit{neglect of
unstructured review knowledge} and 2) \textit{underutilization of large
language models (LLMs)}. Inspired by this, we aim to fully utilize dual
knowledge (\textit{i.e., } structured attribute and unstructured review
knowledge) with LLMs to promote textual response generation in multimodal
task-oriented dialog systems. However, this task is non-trivial due to two key
challenges: 1) \textit{dynamic knowledge type selection} and 2)
\textit{intention-response decoupling}. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel dual knowledge-enhanced two-stage reasoner by adapting LLMs for
multimodal dialog systems (named DK2R). To be specific, DK2R first extracts
both structured attribute and unstructured review knowledge from external
knowledge base given the dialog context. Thereafter, DK2R uses an LLM to
evaluate each knowledge type's utility by analyzing LLM-generated provisional
probe responses. Moreover, DK2R separately summarizes the intention-oriented
key clues via dedicated reasoning, which are further used as auxiliary signals
to enhance LLM-based textual response generation. Extensive experiments
conducted on a public dataset verify the superiority of DK2R. We have released
the codes and parameters.

Conclusion: TF2提供了一个端到端、可复现的流程，用于研究成本效益高的翻译、跨语言叙事生成，以及在低资源环境中广泛采用开源模型处理具有文化意义的文学内容。

Abstract: Literary translation has recently gained attention as a distinct and complex
task in machine translation research. However, the translation by small open
models remains an open problem. We contribute to this ongoing research by
introducing TINYFABULIST TRANSLATION FRAMEWORK (TF2), a unified framework for
dataset creation, fine tuning, and evaluation in English-Romanian literary
translations, centred on the creation and open release of both a compact, fine
tuned language model (TF2-12B) and large scale synthetic parallel datasets
(DS-TF2-EN-RO-3M and DS-TF2-EN-RO-15K). Building on DS-TF1-EN-3M (TF1), the
largest collection of synthetic English fables to date, we address the need for
rich, high quality literary datasets in low resource languages such as
Romanian. Our pipeline first generates 15k high quality Romanian references
from the TF1 pool using a high performing LLM. We then apply a two stage fine
tuning process to a 12B parameter open weight model: (i) instruction tuning to
capture genre specific narrative style, and (ii) adapter compression for
efficient deployment. Evaluation combines corpus level BLEU and a five
dimension LLM based rubric (accuracy, fluency, coherence, style, cultural
adaptation) to provide a nuanced assessment of translation quality. Results
show that our fine tuned model achieves fluency and adequacy competitive with
top performing large proprietary models, while being open, accessible, and
significantly more cost effective. Alongside the fine tuned model and both
datasets, we publicly release all scripts and evaluation prompts. TF2 thus
provides an end-to-end, reproducible pipeline for research on cost efficient
translation, cross lingual narrative generation, and the broad adoption of open
models for culturally significant literary content in low resource settings.

Motivation: 探索人类标注者是否也像LLM一样对指令变化敏感，以及LLM的提示词脆弱性是否反映了人类标注的方差

Method: 通过文本分类任务，对LLM和人类标注者使用相同的提示词变体进行系统比较

Result: 人类和LLM都对特定类型的提示词修改表现出脆弱性，但人类对拼写错误和标签顺序反转的敏感性较低

Conclusion: 提示词脆弱性并非LLM特有，人类标注也存在类似敏感性，但程度和类型有所不同

Abstract: The output of large language models (LLM) is unstable, due to both
non-determinism of the decoding process as well as to prompt brittleness. While
the intrinsic non-determinism of LLM generation may mimic existing uncertainty
in human annotations through distributional shifts in outputs, it is largely
assumed, yet unexplored, that the prompt brittleness effect is unique to LLMs.
This raises the question: do human annotators show similar sensitivity to
instruction changes? If so, should prompt brittleness in LLMs be considered
problematic? One may alternatively hypothesize that prompt brittleness
correctly reflects human annotation variances. To fill this research gap, we
systematically compare the effects of prompt modifications on LLMs and
identical instruction modifications for human annotators, focusing on the
question of whether humans are similarly sensitive to prompt perturbations. To
study this, we prompt both humans and LLMs for a set of text classification
tasks conditioned on prompt variations. Our findings indicate that both humans
and LLMs exhibit increased brittleness in response to specific types of prompt
modifications, particularly those involving the substitution of alternative
label sets or label formats. However, the distribution of human judgments is
less affected by typographical errors and reversed label order than that of
LLMs.

Abstract: This paper presents our team's solution to Shared Task 7 of NLPCC-2025, which
focuses on sentence-level gender bias detection and mitigation in Chinese. The
task aims to promote fairness and controllability in natural language
generation by automatically detecting, classifying, and mitigating gender bias.
To address this challenge, we adopt a fine-tuning approach based on large
language models (LLMs), efficiently adapt to the bias detection task via
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). In terms of data processing, we construct a more
balanced training set to alleviate class imbalance and introduce heterogeneous
samples from multiple sources to enhance model generalization. For the
detection and classification sub-tasks, we employ a majority voting strategy
that integrates outputs from multiple expert models to boost performance.
Additionally, to improve bias generation detection and mitigation, we design a
multi-temperature sampling mechanism to capture potential variations in bias
expression styles. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in bias detection, classification, and mitigation. Our method
ultimately achieves an average score of 47.90%, ranking fourth in the shared
task.

protagonist is described as a girl (as compared to a boy), appearance-related
attributes increase by 55.26%. Stories featuring non-Western children
disproportionately emphasize cultural heritage, tradition, and family themes
far more than those for Western children. Our findings highlight the role of
sociocultural bias in making creative AI use more equitable and diverse.

TL;DR: GENUINE是一个基于图结构的多层次不确定性估计框架，通过依赖解析树和分层图池化来改进LLM的不确定性量化，在NLP任务中比语义熵方法AUROC提高29%，校准误差降低15%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视语义依赖关系，仅依赖词级概率度量，无法捕捉生成文本中的结构关系，需要更可靠的不确定性估计方法来提高LLM在高风险应用中的可靠性

Method: 提出GENUINE框架，利用依赖解析树和分层图池化技术，结合监督学习来建模语义和结构关系，改进置信度评估

Result: 在NLP任务上的广泛实验显示，GENUINE比基于语义熵的方法AUROC提高达29%，校准误差降低超过15%

Conclusion: 基于图结构的不确定性建模方法有效，GENUINE框架显著提升了LLM不确定性估计的性能

Abstract: Uncertainty estimation is essential for enhancing the reliability of Large
Language Models (LLMs), particularly in high-stakes applications. Existing
methods often overlook semantic dependencies, relying on token-level
probability measures that fail to capture structural relationships within the
generated text. We propose GENUINE: Graph ENhanced mUlti-level uncertaINty
Estimation for Large Language Models, a structure-aware framework that
leverages dependency parse trees and hierarchical graph pooling to refine
uncertainty quantification. By incorporating supervised learning, GENUINE
effectively models semantic and structural relationships, improving confidence
assessments. Extensive experiments across NLP tasks show that GENUINE achieves
up to 29% higher AUROC than semantic entropy-based approaches and reduces
calibration errors by over 15%, demonstrating the effectiveness of graph-based
uncertainty modeling. The code is available at

TL;DR: Parallel-R1是一个强化学习框架，通过渐进式课程训练LLMs的并行思维能力，在数学推理任务上比顺序思维模型提升8.4%准确率，并可作为训练探索支架带来42.9%的性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖监督微调合成数据，鼓励教师强制模仿而非探索和泛化，难以通过训练激活并行思维能力

Method: 提出首个强化学习框架Parallel-R1，采用渐进式课程：先用SFT在简单任务上培养并行思维，然后转向RL在困难问题上探索和泛化该技能

Result: 在MATH、AMC23、AIME等数学基准上取得8.4%准确率提升，分析显示模型早期使用并行思维进行探索，后期用于多视角验证，作为训练探索支架可在AIME25上带来42.9%的性能提升

Conclusion: Parallel-R1成功培养了并行思维能力，验证了并行思维作为训练探索支架的价值，能够解锁更高的性能上限

Abstract: Parallel thinking has emerged as a novel approach for enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by exploring multiple reasoning
paths concurrently. However, activating such capabilities through training
remains challenging, as existing methods predominantly rely on supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) over synthetic data, which encourages teacher-forced
imitation rather than exploration and generalization. Different from them, we
propose \textbf{Parallel-R1}, the first reinforcement learning (RL) framework
that enables parallel thinking behaviors for complex real-world reasoning
tasks. Our framework employs a progressive curriculum that explicitly addresses
the cold-start problem in training parallel thinking with RL. We first use SFT
on prompt-generated trajectories from easier tasks to instill the parallel
thinking ability, then transition to RL to explore and generalize this skill on
harder problems. Experiments on various math benchmarks, including MATH, AMC23,
and AIME, show that Parallel-R1 successfully instills parallel thinking,
leading to 8.4% accuracy improvements over the sequential thinking model
trained directly on challenging tasks with RL. Further analysis reveals a clear
shift in the model's thinking behavior: at an early stage, it uses parallel
thinking as an exploration strategy, while in a later stage, it uses the same
capability for multi-perspective verification. Most significantly, we validate
parallel thinking as a \textbf{mid-training exploration scaffold}, where this
temporary exploratory phase unlocks a higher performance ceiling after RL,
yielding a 42.9% improvement over the baseline on AIME25. Our model, data, and
code will be open-source at https://github.com/zhengkid/Parallel-R1.

Method: 提出包含设计、优化、制造和检测四个阶段的统一制造流程，在工业案例（叶片）中验证

Result: 演示的叶片案例在承受相同压力限制的同时，相比实体对应物显著减少了材料使用量

Conclusion: 该流程成功实现了新一代非实体、含异质自由形式内部微结构的CAD对象制造，为制造业带来材料节约和成本降低的潜力

Abstract: With the evolution of new manufacturing technologies such as multi-material
3D printing, one can think of new type of objects that consist of considerably
less, yet heterogeneous, material, consequently being porous, lighter and
cheaper, while having the very same functionality as the original object when
manufactured from one single solid material. We aim at questioning five decades
of traditional paradigms in geometric CAD and focus at new generation of CAD
objects that are not solid, but contain heterogeneous free-form internal
microstructures. We propose a unified manufacturing pipeline that involves all
stages, namely design, optimization, manufacturing, and inspection of
microstructured free-form geometries. We demonstrate our pipeline on an
industrial test case of a blisk blade that sustains the desired pressure
limits, yet requires significantly less material when compared to the solid
counterpart.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图像评估指标（如FID、LPIPS、CLIPScore）无法满足SVG图像的符号化和矢量特性需求，需要专门针对SVG的评估标准。

Method: SVGauge联合测量：(1)视觉保真度：通过提取SigLIP图像嵌入，使用PCA和白化进行域对齐；(2)语义一致性：通过比较BLIP-2生成的SVG标题与原始提示在SBERT和TF-IDF组合空间中的相似度。

Result: 在SHE基准测试中，SVGauge获得了最高的人类判断相关性，比现有指标更准确地重现了8个零样本LLM生成器的系统级排名。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了矢量特定评估的必要性，并为未来文本到SVG生成模型的基准测试提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Generated Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) images demand evaluation criteria
tuned to their symbolic and vectorial nature: criteria that existing metrics
such as FID, LPIPS, or CLIPScore fail to satisfy. In this paper, we introduce
SVGauge, the first human-aligned, reference based metric for text-to-SVG
generation. SVGauge jointly measures (i) visual fidelity, obtained by
extracting SigLIP image embeddings and refining them with PCA and whitening for
domain alignment, and (ii) semantic consistency, captured by comparing
BLIP-2-generated captions of the SVGs against the original prompts in the
combined space of SBERT and TF-IDF. Evaluation on the proposed SHE benchmark
shows that SVGauge attains the highest correlation with human judgments and
reproduces system-level rankings of eight zero-shot LLM-based generators more
faithfully than existing metrics. Our results highlight the necessity of
vector-specific evaluation and provide a practical tool for benchmarking future
text-to-SVG generation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Voronoi图在许多应用中重要，但计算效率仍有提升空间。现有方法在计算限制Voronoi图时存在效率问题

Method: 使用边基搜索策略找到剪裁平面，通过点在单元内测试判断端点位置，只对需要的边进行剪裁操作，减少多余计算

Result: 方法在各种点分布情况下都显示出最佳性能，超过现有最先进方法

Conclusion: 该方法通过减少不必要的剪裁操作显著提高了限制Voronoi图的计算效率，并具有良好的并行化潜力

Abstract: Since the Voronoi diagram appears in many applications, the topic of
improving its computational efficiency remains attractive. We propose a novel
yet efficient method to compute Voronoi diagrams bounded by a given domain,
i.e., the clipped or restricted Voronoi diagrams. The intersection of the
domain and a Voronoi cell (domain-cell intersection) is generated by removing
the part outside the cell from the domain, which can be accomplished by several
clippings. Different from the existing methods, we present an edge-based search
scheme to find clipping planes (bisectors). A test called point-in-cell is
first set up to tell whether a space point is in a target Voronoi cell or not.
Then, for each edge of the intermediate domain-cell intersection, we will
launch a clipping only if its two endpoints are respectively inside and outside
the corresponding Voronoi cell, where the bisector for the clipping can be
found by using a few times of point-in-cell tests. Therefore, our method only
involves the clippings that contribute to the final results, which is a great
advantage over the state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, because each
domain-cell intersection can be generated independently, we extend the proposed
method to the GPUs for computing Voronoi diagrams in parallel. The experimental
results show the best performance of our method compared to state-of-the-art
ones, regardless of site distribution. This paper was first submitted to
SIGGRAPH Asia 2025.

Method: 提出神经锥热辐方法，采用预筛波的多分辨率哈希网格来准确近似光泽BSDF缝，通过连续空间聚合将视角依赖的反射特性嵌入编码过程

Conclusion: 综合实验结果表明，该方法在各种光泽条件下都能产生高质量、无噪声的实时渲染效果，与基准方法相比具有更高的保真度和现实感

Abstract: Modeling of high-frequency outgoing radiance distributions has long been a
key challenge in rendering, particularly for glossy material. Such
distributions concentrate radiative energy within a narrow lobe and are highly
sensitive to changes in view direction. However, existing neural radiosity
methods, which primarily rely on positional feature encoding, exhibit notable
limitations in capturing these high-frequency, strongly view-dependent radiance
distributions. To address this, we propose a highly-efficient approach by
reflectance-aware ray cone encoding based on the neural radiosity framework,
named neural cone radiosity. The core idea is to employ a pre-filtered
multi-resolution hash grid to accurately approximate the glossy BSDF lobe,
embedding view-dependent reflectance characteristics directly into the encoding
process through continuous spatial aggregation. Our design not only
significantly improves the network's ability to model high-frequency reflection
distributions but also effectively handles surfaces with a wide range of
glossiness levels, from highly glossy to low-gloss finishes. Meanwhile, our
method reduces the network's burden in fitting complex radiance distributions,
allowing the overall architecture to remain compact and efficient.
Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently
produces high-quality, noise-free renderings in real time under various
glossiness conditions, and delivers superior fidelity and realism compared to
baseline approaches.

Motivation: 体积视频作为数字化动态物理世界的重要媒介，但现有方法难以在保持长程跟踪的同时处理拓扑变化，这限制了沉浸式体验的质量。

Method: 使用稀疏运动高斯表示场景运动，通过时空跟踪器和光度线索检测结构变化；每个运动高斯锚定一组局部外观高斯，通过非刚性扭曲提供强初始化；引入全局高斯查找表记录高斯生命周期并组织属性。

Result: 能够高效建模细节纹理并保持时间一致性，在挑战性场景（如换衣服）下实现高保真渲染；支持与标准视频编解码器自然对齐，实现高达40倍的压缩。

Conclusion: TaoGS为拓扑变化下的可扩展体积视频提供了统一的适应性解决方案，能够捕捉"运动中的优雅"和"静止中的力量"，提供与物理世界协调的沉浸式体验。

Abstract: Volumetric video is emerging as a key medium for digitizing the dynamic
physical world, creating the virtual environments with six degrees of freedom
to deliver immersive user experiences. However, robustly modeling general
dynamic scenes, especially those involving topological changes while
maintaining long-term tracking remains a fundamental challenge. In this paper,
we present TaoGS, a novel topology-aware dynamic Gaussian representation that
disentangles motion and appearance to support, both, long-range tracking and
topological adaptation. We represent scene motion with a sparse set of motion
Gaussians, which are continuously updated by a spatio-temporal tracker and
photometric cues that detect structural variations across frames. To capture
fine-grained texture, each motion Gaussian anchors and dynamically activates a
set of local appearance Gaussians, which are non-rigidly warped to the current
frame to provide strong initialization and significantly reduce training time.
This activation mechanism enables efficient modeling of detailed textures and
maintains temporal coherence, allowing high-fidelity rendering even under
challenging scenarios such as changing clothes. To enable seamless integration
into codec-based volumetric formats, we introduce a global Gaussian Lookup
Table that records the lifespan of each Gaussian and organizes attributes into
a lifespan-aware 2D layout. This structure aligns naturally with standard video
codecs and supports up to 40 compression. TaoGS provides a unified, adaptive
solution for scalable volumetric video under topological variation, capturing
moments where "elegance in motion" and "Power in Stillness", delivering
immersive experiences that harmonize with the physical world.

Conclusion: 结合Fermatean模糊集和偏差最大化方法的优化模型为多准则决策提供了有效的工具，特别是在处理可再生能源选择这类具有技术、管理和政治多重影响的重要问题时表现出良好效果。

Abstract: Multi-criteria decision-making methods provide decision-makers with
appropriate tools to make better decisions in uncertain, complex, and
conflicting situations. Fuzzy set theory primarily deals with the uncertainty
inherent in human thoughts and perceptions and attempts to quantify this
uncertainty. Fuzzy logic and fuzzy set theory are utilized with multi-criteria
decision-making methods because they effectively handle uncertainty and
fuzziness in decision-makers' judgments, allowing for verbal judgments of the
problem. This study utilizes the Fermatean fuzzy environment, a generalization
of fuzzy sets. An optimization model based on the deviation maximization method
is proposed to determine partially known feature weights. This method is
combined with interval-valued Fermatean fuzzy sets. The proposed method was
applied to the problem of selecting renewable energy sources. The reason for
choosing renewable energy sources is that meeting energy needs from renewable
sources, balancing carbon emissions, and mitigating the effects of global
climate change are among the most critical issues of the recent period. Even
though selecting renewable energy sources is a technical issue, the managerial
and political implications of this issue are also important, and are discussed
in this study.

Abstract: We introduce Spectral NSR, a fully spectral neuro-symbolic reasoning
framework that embeds logical rules as spectral templates and performs
inference directly in the graph spectral domain. By leveraging graph signal
processing (GSP) and frequency-selective filters grounded in the Laplacian
eigenstructure of knowledge graphs, the architecture unifies the
interpretability of symbolic reasoning with the scalability and adaptability of
spectral learning. Beyond the core formulation, we incorporate a comprehensive
set of extensions, including dynamic graph and basis learning, rational and
diffusion filters for sharper spectral selectivity, mixture-of-spectral-experts
for modular specialization, proof-guided training with spectral curricula, and
uncertainty quantification for calibrated confidence. Additional enhancements
such as large language model coupling, co-spectral transfer alignment,
adversarial robustness, efficient GPU kernels, generalized Laplacians, and
causal interventions further expand the versatility of the framework.
  Empirical evaluation on state-of-the-art reasoning benchmarks such as
ProofWriter and CLUTRR demonstrates that Spectral NSR achieves superior
accuracy, faster inference, improved robustness to adversarial perturbations,
and higher interpretability compared to leading baselines including
transformers, message-passing neural networks, and neuro-symbolic logic
programming systems. Spectral attribution and proof-band agreement analyses
confirm that model decisions align closely with symbolic proof structures,
while transfer experiments validate effective domain adaptation through
co-spectral alignment. These results establish Spectral NSR as a scalable and
principled foundation for the next generation of reasoning systems, offering
transparency, robustness, and generalization beyond conventional approaches.

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents have advanced rapidly but still
struggle with complex tasks involving novel UI elements, long-horizon actions,
and personalized trajectories. In this work, we introduce Instruction Agent, a
GUI agent that leverages expert demonstrations to solve such tasks, enabling
completion of otherwise difficult workflows. Given a single demonstration, the
agent extracts step-by-step instructions and executes them by strictly
following the trajectory intended by the user, which avoids making mistakes
during execution. The agent leverages the verifier and backtracker modules
further to improve robustness. Both modules are critical to understand the
current outcome from each action and handle unexpected interruptions(such as
pop-up windows) during execution. Our experiments show that Instruction Agent
achieves a 60% success rate on a set of tasks in OSWorld that all top-ranked
agents failed to complete. The Instruction Agent offers a practical and
extensible framework, bridging the gap between current GUI agents and reliable
real-world GUI task automation.

Abstract: Neurosymbolic (NeSy) frameworks combine neural representations and learning
with symbolic representations and reasoning. Combining the reasoning
capacities, explainability, and interpretability of symbolic processing with
the flexibility and power of neural computing allows us to solve complex
problems with more reliability while being data-efficient. However, this
recently growing topic poses a challenge to developers with its learning curve,
lack of user-friendly tools, libraries, and unifying frameworks. In this paper,
we characterize the technical facets of existing NeSy frameworks, such as the
symbolic representation language, integration with neural models, and the
underlying algorithms. A majority of the NeSy research focuses on algorithms
instead of providing generic frameworks for declarative problem specification
to leverage problem solving. To highlight the key aspects of Neurosymbolic
modeling, we showcase three generic NeSy frameworks - \textit{DeepProbLog},
\textit{Scallop}, and \textit{DomiKnowS}. We identify the challenges within
each facet that lay the foundation for identifying the expressivity of each
framework in solving a variety of problems. Building on this foundation, we aim
to spark transformative action and encourage the community to rethink this

to electromyographic (EMG) contamination. Traditional preprocessing based on
bandpass filtering within a fixed range (e.g., 500--1000 Hz) is susceptible to
overlapping EMG and SKNA spectral components, especially during sustained
muscle activity. We present a denoising approach using a lightweight
one-dimensional convolutional autoencoder with a long short-term memory (LSTM)
bottleneck to reconstruct clean SKNA from EMG-contaminated recordings. Using
clean ECG-derived SKNA data from cognitive stress experiments and EMG noise
from chaotic muscle stimulation recordings, we simulated contamination at
realistic noise levels (--4 dB, --8 dB signal-to-noise ratio) and trained the
model in the leave-one-subject-out cross-validation framework. The method
improved signal-to-noise ratio by up to 9.65 dB, increased cross correlation
with clean SKNA from 0.40 to 0.72, and restored burst-based SKNA features to
near-clean discriminability (AUROC $\geq$ 0.96). Classification of baseline
versus sympathetic stimulation (cognitive stress) conditions reached accuracies
of 91--98\% across severe noise levels, comparable to clean data. These results
demonstrate that deep learning--based reconstruction can preserve
physiologically relevant sympathetic bursts during substantial EMG
interference, enabling more robust SKNA monitoring in naturalistic,
movement-rich environments.

*Heng Hao,Wenjun Hu,Oxana Verkholyak,Davoud Ataee Tarzanagh,Baruch Gutow,Sima Didari,Masoud Faraki,Hankyu Moon,Seungjai Min*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PaVeRL-SQL是一个结合部分匹配奖励和语言强化学习的框架，通过两种管道（上下文学习框架和思维链强化学习）在Text-to-SQL任务上实现了最先进的性能，在工业级基准测试中显著提升了执行准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Text-to-SQL方法在工业级数据库和涉及领域特定业务逻辑的复杂问题上执行准确率较低，需要开发更可靠的解决方案来满足实际工业应用需求。

Method: 提出了PaVeRL-SQL框架，采用两种管道：1）新设计的上下文学习框架与群体自评估（语言强化学习）；2）思维链强化学习管道，使用专门设计的奖励函数和两阶段强化学习训练小型骨干模型。

Result: 在Spider、Spider 2.0和BIRD基准测试上达到最先进水平。在工业级Spider2.0-SQLite基准上，语言强化学习管道比现有最好方法高7.4%，思维链管道高1.4%。混合SQL方言训练带来三倍增益。

Conclusion: PaVeRL-SQL在现实工业约束下提供了可靠的最先进Text-to-SQL解决方案，特别在处理复杂业务逻辑和工业级数据库方面表现出色。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL models allow users to interact with a database more easily by
generating executable SQL statements from natural-language questions. Despite
recent successes on simpler databases and questions, current Text-to-SQL
methods still suffer from low execution accuracy on industry-scale databases
and complex questions involving domain-specific business logic. We present
\emph{PaVeRL-SQL}, a framework that combines \emph{Partial-Match Rewards} and
\emph{Verbal Reinforcement Learning} to drive self-improvement in reasoning
language models (RLMs) for Text-to-SQL. To handle practical use cases, we adopt
two pipelines: (1) a newly designed in-context learning framework with group
self-evaluation (verbal-RL), using capable open- and closed-source large
language models (LLMs) as backbones; and (2) a chain-of-thought (CoT) RL
pipeline with a small backbone model (OmniSQL-7B) trained with a specially
designed reward function and two-stage RL. These pipelines achieve
state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on popular Text-to-SQL benchmarks -- Spider,
Spider 2.0, and BIRD. For the industrial-level Spider2.0-SQLite benchmark, the
verbal-RL pipeline achieves an execution accuracy 7.4\% higher than SOTA, and
the CoT pipeline is 1.4\% higher. RL training with mixed SQL dialects yields
strong, threefold gains, particularly for dialects with limited training data.
Overall, \emph{PaVeRL-SQL} delivers reliable, SOTA Text-to-SQL under realistic
industrial constraints. The code is available at
https://github.com/PaVeRL-SQL/PaVeRL-SQL.

Motivation: 每年数百万人通过法律援助热线寻求帮助，错误分类会导致严重后果（错过截止日期、遭受虐待、失去住房或子女监护权），需要准确快速地将申请人匹配到正确的法律帮助。

Method: 采用混合LLM/ML集成分类方法，自动生成后续问题来丰富初始问题叙述，使用包含419个真实查询的新数据集进行训练和评估。

Result: 分类准确率（hits@2）达到97.37%，使用低成本模型组合超越了当前最先进的GPT-5模型的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在显著降低法律系统用户引导成本的同时实现了高准确性，有望改善法律援助服务的匹配效率。

Abstract: Each year millions of people seek help for their legal problems by calling a
legal aid program hotline, walking into a legal aid office, or using a lawyer
referral service. The first step to match them to the right help is to identify
the legal problem the applicant is experiencing. Misdirection has consequences.
Applicants may miss a deadline, experience physical abuse, lose housing or lose
custody of children while waiting to connect to the right legal help. We
introduce and evaluate the FETCH classifier for legal issue classification and
describe two methods for improving accuracy: a hybrid LLM/ML ensemble
classification method, and the automatic generation of follow-up questions to
enrich the initial problem narrative. We employ a novel data set of 419
real-world queries to a nonprofit lawyer referral service. Ultimately, we show
classification accuracy (hits@2) of 97.37\% using a mix of inexpensive models,
exceeding the performance of the current state-of-the-art GPT-5 model. Our
approach shows promise in significantly reducing the cost of guiding users of
the legal system to the right resource for their problem while achieving high
accuracy.

Conclusion: 该研究成功开发了一种高效的混合深度学习入侵检测系统，能够有效防范智能电网面临的网络安全威胁，为智能电网的安全运行提供了可靠保障。

Abstract: The evolution of the traditional power grid into the "smart grid" has
resulted in a fundamental shift in energy management, which allows the
integration of renewable energy sources with modern communication technology.
However, this interconnection has increased smart grids' vulnerability to
attackers, which might result in privacy breaches, operational interruptions,
and massive outages. The SCADA-based smart grid protocols are critical for
real-time data collection and control, but they are vulnerable to attacks like
unauthorized access and denial of service (DoS). This research proposes a
hybrid deep learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) intended to improve
the cybersecurity of smart grids. The suggested model takes advantage of
Convolutional Neural Networks' (CNN) feature extraction capabilities as well as
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks' temporal pattern recognition skills.
DNP3 and IEC104 intrusion detection datasets are employed to train and test our
CNN-LSTM model to recognize and classify the potential cyber threats. Compared
to other deep learning approaches, the results demonstrate considerable
improvements in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with a detection
accuracy of 99.70%.

Result: 实验显示在不同BWB构型上表面预测误差较低

Conclusion: BlendedNet为非常规构型提供了宝贵的数据资源，并展示了端到端代理框架在气动预测中的有效性

Abstract: BlendedNet is a publicly available aerodynamic dataset of 999 blended wing
body (BWB) geometries. Each geometry is simulated across about nine flight
conditions, yielding 8830 converged RANS cases with the Spalart-Allmaras model
and 9 to 14 million cells per case. The dataset is generated by sampling
geometric design parameters and flight conditions, and includes detailed
pointwise surface quantities needed to study lift and drag. We also introduce
an end-to-end surrogate framework for pointwise aerodynamic prediction. The
pipeline first uses a permutation-invariant PointNet regressor to predict
geometric parameters from sampled surface point clouds, then conditions a
Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) network on the predicted parameters and
flight conditions to predict pointwise coefficients Cp, Cfx, and Cfz.
Experiments show low errors in surface predictions across diverse BWBs.
BlendedNet addresses data scarcity for unconventional configurations and
enables research on data-driven surrogate modeling for aerodynamic design.

Abstract: Mobile and wearable healthcare monitoring play a vital role in facilitating
timely interventions, managing chronic health conditions, and ultimately
improving individuals' quality of life. Previous studies on large language
models (LLMs) have highlighted their impressive generalization abilities and
effectiveness in healthcare prediction tasks. However, most LLM-based
healthcare solutions are cloud-based, which raises significant privacy concerns
and results in increased memory usage and latency. To address these challenges,
there is growing interest in compact models, Small Language Models (SLMs),
which are lightweight and designed to run locally and efficiently on mobile and
wearable devices. Nevertheless, how well these models perform in healthcare
prediction remains largely unexplored. We systematically evaluated SLMs on
health prediction tasks using zero-shot, few-shot, and instruction fine-tuning
approaches, and deployed the best performing fine-tuned SLMs on mobile devices
to evaluate their real-world efficiency and predictive performance in practical
healthcare scenarios. Our results show that SLMs can achieve performance
comparable to LLMs while offering substantial gains in efficiency and privacy.
However, challenges remain, particularly in handling class imbalance and
few-shot scenarios. These findings highlight SLMs, though imperfect in their
current form, as a promising solution for next-generation, privacy-preserving
healthcare monitoring.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文对中间代币生成(ITG)机制进行了批判性研究，发现中间追踪长度与问题难度无明显相关，而是主要受训练数据分布影响，挑战了将长追踪解释为"思考努力"的假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然中间代币生成和思维链(CoT)与性能提升相关，但其底层机制仍不清楚。研究者想要批判性地检验中间代币序列长度是否真正反映问题难度的假设。

Method: 使用A* 搜索算法的演绎追踪从头训练transformer模型，这种方法能够提供问题复杂性的精确可验证测量。首先在简单问题上评估，然后系统性地在分布外问题上评估模型。

Result: 发现即使在最简单的任务中，模型也经常产生过长的识别追踪，有时还无法生成解决方案。中间代币长度与真实A* 追踪长度只有松散相关。仅在问题更接近训练分布时才出现相关性，表明这是近似回忆而非真正的问题适应性计算。

Conclusion: 问题实例的内在计算复杂性并非关键因素，关键在于其与训练数据的分布距离。这些结果挑战了中间追踪生成适应问题难度的假设，并警告不要将R1等系统中更长的序列自动解释为"思考努力"的标志。

Abstract: Intermediate token generation (ITG), where a model produces output before the
solution, has been proposed as a method to improve the performance of language
models on reasoning tasks. While these reasoning traces or Chain of Thoughts
(CoTs) are correlated with performance gains, the mechanisms underlying them
remain unclear. A prevailing assumption in the community has been to
anthropomorphize these tokens as "thinking", treating longer traces as evidence
of higher problem-adaptive computation. In this work, we critically examine
whether intermediate token sequence length reflects or correlates with problem
difficulty. To do so, we train transformer models from scratch on derivational
traces of the A* search algorithm, where the number of operations required to
solve a maze problem provides a precise and verifiable measure of problem
complexity. We first evaluate the models on trivial free-space problems,
finding that even for the simplest tasks, they often produce excessively long
reasoning traces and sometimes fail to generate a solution. We then
systematically evaluate the model on out-of-distribution problems and find that
the intermediate token length and ground truth A* trace length only loosely
correlate. We notice that the few cases where correlation appears are those
where the problems are closer to the training distribution, suggesting that the
effect arises from approximate recall rather than genuine problem-adaptive
computation. This suggests that the inherent computational complexity of the
problem instance is not a significant factor, but rather its distributional
distance from the training data. These results challenge the assumption that
intermediate trace generation is adaptive to problem difficulty and caution
against interpreting longer sequences in systems like R1 as automatically
indicative of "thinking effort".

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受AlphaEvolve启发，但AlphaEvolve仅限于数百行代码的独立内核，需要将LLM代码进化扩展到完整代码库规模，涵盖数百个文件和数万行C/C++代码。

Method: SATLUTION框架协调LLM代理在严格正确性保证和分布式运行时反馈下直接进化求解器仓库，同时自我进化其进化策略和规则。

Result: 从SAT竞赛2024代码库开始，SATLUTION进化的求解器在SAT竞赛2025中显著超越了人类设计的冠军，同时在2024基准测试上也超越了2024和2025年的冠军。

Conclusion: 该框架成功证明了LLM可以在完整代码库规模上进行代码进化，并在复杂算法问题上超越人类专家表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong coding abilities,
enabling not only static code generation but also iterative code self-evolving
through agentic frameworks. Recently, AlphaEvolve \cite{novikov2025alphaevolve}
demonstrated that LLM-based coding agents can autonomously improve algorithms
and surpass human experts, with scopes limited to isolated kernels spanning
hundreds of lines of code. Inspired by AlphaEvolve, we present SATLUTION, the
first framework to extend LLM-based code evolution to the full repository
scale, encompassing hundreds of files and tens of thousands of lines of C/C++
code. Targeting Boolean Satisfiability (SAT), the canonical NP-complete problem
and a cornerstone of both theory and applications. SATLUTION orchestrates LLM
agents to directly evolve solver repositories under strict correctness
guarantees and distributed runtime feedback, while simultaneously self-evolving
its own evolution policies and rules. Starting from SAT Competition 2024
codebases and benchmark, SATLUTION evolved solvers that decisively outperformed
the human-designed winners of the SAT Competition 2025, and also surpassed both
2024 and 2025 champions on the 2024 benchmarks.

Result: 在Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct模型上的实验显示，通过自我对弈单独能够在具有挑战性的任务上提升性能，效果超过依赖数据的基准方法。

Conclusion: 语言自我对弈是一种有效的方法，能够在不需额外数据的情况下提升大语言模型的性能，为模型进化提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent years, driven by
scale, abundant high-quality training data, and reinforcement learning. Yet
this progress faces a fundamental bottleneck: the need for ever more data from
which models can continue to learn. In this work, we propose a reinforcement
learning approach that removes this dependency by enabling models to improve
without additional data. Our method leverages a game-theoretic framework of
self-play, where a model's capabilities are cast as performance in a
competitive game and stronger policies emerge by having the model play against
itself - a process we call Language Self-Play (LSP). Experiments with
Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct on instruction-following benchmarks show that pretrained
models can not only enhance their performance on challenging tasks through
self-play alone, but can also do so more effectively than data-driven
baselines.

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型在电子表格布局生成中表现优异，但需要结合规则和视觉反射策略来弥补对齐方面的不足，为自动化电子表格设计提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Spreadsheets are critical to data-centric tasks, with rich, structured
layouts that enable efficient information transmission. Given the time and
expertise required for manual spreadsheet layout design, there is an urgent
need for automated solutions. However, existing automated layout models are
ill-suited to spreadsheets, as they often (1) treat components as axis-aligned
rectangles with continuous coordinates, overlooking the inherently discrete,
grid-based structure of spreadsheets; and (2) neglect interrelated semantics,
such as data dependencies and contextual links, unique to spreadsheets. In this
paper, we first formalize the spreadsheet layout generation task, supported by
a seven-criterion evaluation protocol and a dataset of 3,326 spreadsheets. We
then introduce SheetDesigner, a zero-shot and training-free framework using
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that combines rule and vision
reflection for component placement and content population. SheetDesigner
outperforms five baselines by at least 22.6\%. We further find that through
vision modality, MLLMs handle overlap and balance well but struggle with
alignment, necessitates hybrid rule and visual reflection strategies. Our codes
and data is available at Github.

Abstract: The integration of Deep Learning (DL) in System Dynamics (SD) modeling for
transportation logistics offers significant advantages in scalability and
predictive accuracy. However, these gains are often offset by the loss of
explainability and causal reliability $-$ key requirements in critical
decision-making systems. This paper presents a novel framework for
interpretable-by-design neural system dynamics modeling that synergizes DL with
techniques from Concept-Based Interpretability, Mechanistic Interpretability,
and Causal Machine Learning. The proposed hybrid approach enables the
construction of neural network models that operate on semantically meaningful
and actionable variables, while retaining the causal grounding and transparency
typical of traditional SD models. The framework is conceived to be applied to
real-world case-studies from the EU-funded project AutoMoTIF, focusing on
data-driven decision support, automation, and optimization of multimodal
logistic terminals. We aim at showing how neuro-symbolic methods can bridge the
gap between black-box predictive models and the need for critical decision
support in complex dynamical environments within cyber-physical systems enabled
by the industrial Internet-of-Things.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接提示注入攻击对大语言模型构成严重安全威胁，现有白盒/灰盒方法实用性低，黑盒方法转移性差，需要一种无需梯度信息但具有高转移性的攻击方法。

Method: 使用代理模型的激活值构建能量模型(EBM)来评估对抗提示质量，然后采用标记级Markov Chain Monte Carlo(MCMC)采样适应性地优化对抗提示，实现无梯度的黑盒攻击。

Result: 在五个主流LLM上达到49.6%的攻击成功率，比人工制作提示提高34.6%，在未见任务场景下仍保持36.6%的攻击成功率，显示出良好的跨模型转移性。

Conclusion: 激活值指导的方法能够有效地进行黑盒提示注入攻击，激活值与攻击效果存在相关性，语义模式在转移性漏洞利用中发挥关键作用。

Abstract: Direct Prompt Injection (DPI) attacks pose a critical security threat to
Large Language Models (LLMs) due to their low barrier of execution and high
potential damage. To address the impracticality of existing white-box/gray-box
methods and the poor transferability of black-box methods, we propose an
activations-guided prompt injection attack framework. We first construct an
Energy-based Model (EBM) using activations from a surrogate model to evaluate
the quality of adversarial prompts. Guided by the trained EBM, we employ the
token-level Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to adaptively optimize
adversarial prompts, thereby enabling gradient-free black-box attacks.
Experimental results demonstrate our superior cross-model transferability,
achieving 49.6% attack success rate (ASR) across five mainstream LLMs and 34.6%
improvement over human-crafted prompts, and maintaining 36.6% ASR on unseen
task scenarios. Interpretability analysis reveals a correlation between
activations and attack effectiveness, highlighting the critical role of
semantic patterns in transferable vulnerability exploitation.

Abstract: Adopting Large language models (LLMs) in organizations potentially
revolutionizes our lives and work. However, they can generate off-topic,
discriminating, or harmful content. This AI alignment problem often stems from
misspecifications during the LLM adoption, unnoticed by the principal due to
the LLM's black-box nature. While various research disciplines investigated AI
alignment, they neither address the information asymmetries between
organizational adopters and black-box LLM agents nor consider organizational AI
adoption processes. Therefore, we propose LLM ATLAS (LLM Agency Theory-Led
Alignment Strategy) a conceptual framework grounded in agency (contract)
theory, to mitigate alignment problems during organizational LLM adoption. We
conduct a conceptual literature analysis using the organizational LLM adoption
phases and the agency theory as concepts. Our approach results in (1) providing
an extended literature analysis process specific to AI alignment methods during
organizational LLM adoption and (2) providing a first LLM alignment
problem-solution space.

Method: 扩展ProbLog引入图神经网络谓词，将符号表示视为图，允许神经网络和符号组件以任意顺序分层处理，支持多层神经符号推理。

Result: 在规划、知识图谱补全和GNN表达能力等任务上，DeepGraphLog能有效捕捉复杂关系依赖，克服现有神经符号系统的关键限制。

Conclusion: DeepGraphLog通过将神经符号AI扩展到图结构领域，提供了一个更表达性和灵活的神经符号集成框架。

Abstract: Neurosymbolic AI (NeSy) aims to integrate the statistical strengths of neural
networks with the interpretability and structure of symbolic reasoning.
However, current NeSy frameworks like DeepProbLog enforce a fixed flow where
symbolic reasoning always follows neural processing. This restricts their
ability to model complex dependencies, especially in irregular data structures
such as graphs. In this work, we introduce DeepGraphLog, a novel NeSy framework
that extends ProbLog with Graph Neural Predicates. DeepGraphLog enables
multi-layer neural-symbolic reasoning, allowing neural and symbolic components
to be layered in arbitrary order. In contrast to DeepProbLog, which cannot
handle symbolic reasoning via neural methods, DeepGraphLog treats symbolic
representations as graphs, enabling them to be processed by Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs). We showcase the capabilities of DeepGraphLog on tasks in
planning, knowledge graph completion with distant supervision, and GNN
expressivity. Our results demonstrate that DeepGraphLog effectively captures
complex relational dependencies, overcoming key limitations of existing NeSy
systems. By broadening the applicability of neurosymbolic AI to
graph-structured domains, DeepGraphLog offers a more expressive and flexible
framework for neural-symbolic integration.

TL;DR: 提出了FTR框架，结合用户反馈和增强解码机制来解决LLM自我纠正中的错误定位和推理深度限制问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在推理时容易生成错误内容，现有自我纠正方法存在两个根本限制：(1)缺乏可靠的错误定位指导信号，(2)传统next-token解码范式限制了推理深度

Method: Feedback-Triggered Regeneration (FTR)框架：仅在收到负面用户反馈时激活响应再生，避免错误自我评估导致的错误传播；Long-Term Multipath (LTM)解码：通过延迟序列评估实现多推理路径的系统探索

Result: 在数学推理和代码生成基准测试中，该框架相比最先进的基于提示的自我纠正方法取得了持续且显著的改进

Conclusion: FTR框架通过结合用户反馈和增强解码机制，有效解决了LLM自我纠正的关键限制，显著提升了模型性能

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across
diverse tasks, yet their susceptibility to generating incorrect content during
inference remains a critical unsolved challenge. While self-correction methods
offer potential solutions, their effectiveness is hindered by two inherent
limitations: (1) the absence of reliable guidance signals for error
localization, and (2) the restricted reasoning depth imposed by conventional
next-token decoding paradigms. To address these issues, we propose
Feedback-Triggered Regeneration (FTR), a novel framework that synergizes user
feedback with enhanced decoding dynamics. Specifically, FTR activates response
regeneration only upon receiving negative user feedback, thereby circumventing
error propagation from faulty self-assessment while preserving originally
correct outputs. Furthermore, we introduce Long-Term Multipath (LTM) decoding,
which enables systematic exploration of multiple reasoning trajectories through
delayed sequence evaluation, effectively overcoming the myopic decision-making
characteristic of standard next-token prediction. Extensive experiments on
mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks demonstrate that our
framework achieves consistent and significant improvements over
state-of-the-art prompt-based self-correction methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RIMO是一个新的数学奥林匹克竞赛基准测试，包含整数答案和证明问题两个轨道，旨在消除评估噪声并提供高分辨率的能力测量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奥林匹克级别基准测试存在评分噪声和潜在偏差问题，如异构答案格式需要基于模型的评判器，以及依赖可能有缺陷的解决方案。

Method: RIMO包含两个轨道：RIMO-N将335个IMO问题重写为具有单一整数答案的问题；RIMO-P包含456个证明问题，通过专家检查的解决方案分解为子问题序列进行自动评分。

Result: 对10个前沿LLM（包括GPT-4o和Gemini 2.5 Flash）的测试显示，虽然这些系统在旧基准上表现出色，但在RIMO上的性能急剧下降。

Conclusion: RIMO揭示了当前LLM能力与实际奥林匹克级别推理之间的巨大差距，为未来研究提供了具有挑战性且易于评估的基准套件。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) reach high scores on established mathematical
benchmarks, such as GSM8K and MATH, the research community has turned to
International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) problems to push the evaluation
frontier. However, existing Olympiad-level benchmarks suffer from practical
constraints that introduce grading noise and potential bias, such as
heterogeneous answer formats requiring model-based judges and a reliance on
potentially flawed solutions. We introduce RIMO, a two-track benchmark designed
to preserve peak Olympiad difficulty while eliminating this evaluation noise.
The first track, RIMO-N, rewrites 335 IMO problems to admit a single, unique
integer answer, allowing for deterministic correctness checking. The second
track, RIMO-P, features 456 proof problems with expert-checked solutions, which
are decomposed into a sequence of sub-problems to evaluate the step-by-step
reasoning process via an automated grading system. Our benchmarking of ten
frontier LLMs, including GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Flash, reveals that while these
systems excel on older benchmarks, their performance drops sharply on RIMO.
These results highlight a substantial gap between current LLM capabilities and
actual Olympiad-level reasoning. By providing a challenging yet
easy-to-evaluate suite, RIMO offers a high-resolution yardstick for future
research, presenting a clear target for closing the profound reasoning gap our
findings expose.

Motivation: 帕金森病作为主要神经退行性疾病，诊断出错率高，传统临床评分量表存在限制。最近研究发现肠道微生物与希金森病强相关性，但现有深度学习模型多依赖单一分类器，忽视了菌校间相关性和时间动态。

Method: 收集了39名希金森病患者和健康配偶的肠道微生物组数据，识别差异丰度分类群。提出RFRE特征选择框架，结合随机森林和递归特征消除，并融入生态学知识提高生物学解释性。设计混合分类模型捕捉微生物组数据的时空模式。

Result: 未在摘要中提供，需要完整文章内容来获取详细结果信息。

Conclusion: 未在摘要中提供，需要完整文章内容来得出结论。

Abstract: Background: Parkinson's disease remains a major neurodegenerative disorder
with high misdiagnosis rates, primarily due to reliance on clinical rating
scales. Recent studies have demonstrated a strong association between gut
microbiota and Parkinson's disease, suggesting that microbial composition may
serve as a promising biomarker. Although deep learning models based ongut
microbiota show potential for early prediction, most approaches rely on single
classifiers and often overlook inter-strain correlations or temporal dynamics.
Therefore, there is an urgent need for more robust feature extraction methods
tailored to microbiome data. Methods: We proposed BDPM (A Machine
Learning-Based Feature Extractor for Parkinson's Disease Classification via Gut
Microbiota Analysis). First, we collected gut microbiota profiles from 39
Parkinson's patients and their healthy spouses to identify differentially
abundant taxa. Second, we developed an innovative feature selection framework
named RFRE (Random Forest combined with Recursive Feature Elimination),
integrating ecological knowledge to enhance biological interpretability.
Finally, we designed a hybrid classification model to capture temporal and
spatial patterns in microbiome data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生命周期评估在食品产品碳踏迹计算中的复杂性问题，包括供应链不透明和数据碎片化

Method: 结合生命周期评估技术、公开数据库和知识增强AI技术（包括检索增强生成），开发交互式聊天机器人接口

Result: 建立了一个原型系统，能够估算任意食品的碳踏迹，并允许用户通过聊天探索复合餐饮的碳影响

Conclusion: 该方法为提供可访问的生命周期评估见解展示了潜力，但仍存在数据库不确定性和AI误解等限制

Abstract: Environmental sustainability, particularly in relation to climate change, is
a key concern for consumers, producers, and policymakers. The carbon footprint,
based on greenhouse gas emissions, is a standard metric for quantifying the
contribution to climate change of activities and is often assessed using life
cycle assessment (LCA). However, conducting LCA is complex due to opaque and
global supply chains, as well as fragmented data. This paper presents a
methodology that combines advances in LCA and publicly available databases with
knowledge-augmented AI techniques, including retrieval-augmented generation, to
estimate cradle-to-gate carbon footprints of food products. We introduce a
chatbot interface that allows users to interactively explore the carbon impact
of composite meals and relate the results to familiar activities. A live web
demonstration showcases our proof-of-concept system with arbitrary food items
and follow-up questions, highlighting both the potential and limitations - such
as database uncertainties and AI misinterpretations - of delivering LCA
insights in an accessible format.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Certainty-Guided Reasoning (CGR)方法，通过批评模型自我评估推理置信度，动态调整推理长度，在提高准确率的同时减少token使用量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理语言模型(LRLMs)在解决复杂任务时使用固定的推理token预算，缺乏对推理充分性的自适应判断，需要在效率和可靠性之间找到更好的平衡

Method: 受GAN生成器/判别器框架启发，使用批评模型定期评估自身推理置信度，达到目标置信阈值时终止推理，否则继续推理，实现自适应推理长度控制

Result: 在AIME2024和AIME2025数据集上，CGR提高了基线准确率并减少token使用；64次多种子评估显示稳定性好，方差降低；可节省数百万token，在准确率和效率间提供可调节权衡

Conclusion: 置信度是推理充分性的有效信号，CGR通过将置信度整合到推理过程中，使大型推理语言模型更具适应性、可信性和资源效率，为实际部署铺平道路

Abstract: The rise of large reasoning language models (LRLMs) has unlocked new
potential for solving complex tasks. These models operate with a thinking
budget, that is, a predefined number of reasoning tokens used to arrive at a
solution. We propose a novel approach, inspired by the generator/discriminator
framework in generative adversarial networks, in which a critic model
periodically probes its own reasoning to assess whether it has reached a
confident conclusion. If not, reasoning continues until a target certainty
threshold is met. This mechanism adaptively balances efficiency and reliability
by allowing early termination when confidence is high, while encouraging
further reasoning when uncertainty persists. Through experiments on the
AIME2024 and AIME2025 datasets, we show that Certainty-Guided Reasoning (CGR)
improves baseline accuracy while reducing token usage. Importantly, extended
multi-seed evaluations over 64 runs demonstrate that CGR is stable, reducing
variance across seeds and improving exam-like performance under penalty-based
grading. Additionally, our token savings analysis shows that CGR can eliminate
millions of tokens in aggregate, with tunable trade-offs between certainty
thresholds and efficiency. Together, these findings highlight certainty as a
powerful signal for reasoning sufficiency. By integrating confidence into the
reasoning process, CGR makes large reasoning language models more adaptive,
trustworthy, and resource efficient, paving the way for practical deployment in
domains where both accuracy and computational cost matter.

Motivation: 解决ChatGPT等大语言模型在教室中提供过时或虚构信息的问题，通过RAG技术基于外部资源提高回答的可靠性

Method: 使用新的EduScopeQA数据集（3,176个问题），比较矩阵检索RAG和图基RAG在不同教育学科、问题类型下的表现，包括使用系统性修改的教科书进行测试

Result: OpenAI矩阵检索RAG在低成本事实检索中表现优异，GraphRAG Global在主题性问题中提供更丰富的教育内容，GraphRAG Local在质量关键的素材中准确性最高

Conclusion: 通过动态分支框架根据查询类型选择最优检索方法，可以在考虑资源消耗（10-20倍差异）的同时提高回答保真度和效率，为教育者提供可行动指南

Abstract: Large language models like ChatGPT are increasingly used in classrooms, but
they often provide outdated or fabricated information that can mislead
students. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) improves reliability of LLMs by
grounding responses in external resources. We investigate two accessible RAG
paradigms, vector-based retrieval and graph-based retrieval to identify best
practices for classroom question answering (QA). Existing comparative studies
fail to account for pedagogical factors such as educational disciplines,
question types, and practical deployment costs. Using a novel dataset,
EduScopeQA, of 3,176 questions across academic subjects, we measure performance
on various educational query types, from specific facts to broad thematic
discussions. We also evaluate system alignment with a dataset of systematically
altered textbooks that contradict the LLM's latent knowledge. We find that
OpenAI Vector Search RAG (representing vector-based RAG) performs well as a
low-cost generalist, especially for quick fact retrieval. On the other hand,
GraphRAG Global excels at providing pedagogically rich answers to thematic
queries, and GraphRAG Local achieves the highest accuracy with the dense,
altered textbooks when corpus integrity is critical. Accounting for the 10-20x
higher resource usage of GraphRAG (representing graph-based RAG), we show that
a dynamic branching framework that routes queries to the optimal retrieval
method boosts fidelity and efficiency. These insights provide actionable
guidelines for educators and system designers to integrate RAG-augmented LLMs
into learning environments effectively.

Motivation: 现有代码大语言模型通常依赖从专有LLM蒸馏的大规模指令数据进行微调，成本高昂。本文探索小规模开源LLM作为高质量代码指令数据合成器的潜力。

Method: 提出迭代自蒸馏方法：1）多检查点采样和多维度评分策略进行初始数据选择；2）基于梯度的影响估计方法进行最终数据过滤；3）基于合成数据微调DeepSeek-Coder得到SCoder模型。

Result: SCoder模型在代码生成能力上达到最先进水平，证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 小规模LLM通过适当的训练可以成为强大的代码指令数据合成器，显著降低对专有LLM的依赖和成本，同时保持高质量的代码生成性能。

Abstract: Existing code large language models (LLMs) often rely on large-scale
instruction data distilled from proprietary LLMs for fine-tuning, which
typically incurs high costs. In this paper, we explore the potential of
small-scale open-source LLMs (e.g., 7B) as synthesizers for high-quality code
instruction data construction. We first observe that the data synthesis
capability of small-scale LLMs can be enhanced by training on a few superior
data synthesis samples from proprietary LLMs. Building on this, we propose a
novel iterative self-distillation approach to bootstrap small-scale LLMs,
transforming them into powerful synthesizers that reduce reliance on
proprietary LLMs and minimize costs. Concretely, in each iteration, to obtain
diverse and high-quality self-distilled data, we design multi-checkpoint
sampling and multi-aspect scoring strategies for initial data selection.
Furthermore, to identify the most influential samples, we introduce a
gradient-based influence estimation method for final data filtering. Based on
the code instruction datasets from the small-scale synthesizers, we develop
SCoder, a family of code generation models fine-tuned from DeepSeek-Coder.
SCoder models achieve state-of-the-art code generation capabilities,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.

Motivation: 约束编程建模语言复杂、全局约束众多，非专家难以掌握，阻碍了约束编程在组合问题求解中的广泛应用。需要一种方法让非专家也能获得专家级别的模型。

Method: 利用积累的专家编写模型构建数据库，通过自然语言描述检索最接近的源代码模型，无需人工数据标注，直接向用户提供经过专家验证的模型。

Conclusion: CP-Model-Zoo系统有效解决了非专家使用约束编程的障碍，通过检索专家模型库实现了从自然语言描述到专家级模型的转换，具有很好的实用价值。

Abstract: Constraint Programming and its high-level modeling languages have long been
recognized for their potential to achieve the holy grail of problem-solving.
However, the complexity of modeling languages, the large number of global
constraints, and the art of creating good models have often hindered
non-experts from choosing CP to solve their combinatorial problems. While
generating an expert-level model from a natural-language description of a
problem would be the dream, we are not yet there. We propose a tutoring system
called CP-Model-Zoo, exploiting expert-written models accumulated through the
years. CP-Model-Zoo retrieves the closest source code model from a database
based on a user's natural language description of a combinatorial problem. It
ensures that expert-validated models are presented to the user while
eliminating the need for human data labeling. Our experiments show excellent
accuracy in retrieving the correct model based on a user-input description of a
problem simulated with different levels of expertise.

Motivation: 现有物理基准测试缺乏对真实世界物理竞赛（如物理奥林匹克）的系统性覆盖，且无法实现与人类选手的直接性能比较

Method: 收集2024-2025年13个国际和地区奥赛试题，采用官方评分方案进行细粒度评分，基于奖牌阈值对模型进行奖牌评定

Conclusion: 开源模型与顶尖学生存在显著性能差距，闭源推理模型展现强大物理推理能力，物理推理仍有很大改进空间

Abstract: Recently, the physical capabilities of (M)LLMs have garnered increasing
attention. However, existing benchmarks for physics suffer from two major gaps:
they neither provide systematic and up-to-date coverage of real-world physics
competitions such as physics Olympiads, nor enable direct performance
comparison with humans. To bridge these gaps, we present HiPhO, the first
benchmark dedicated to high school physics Olympiads with human-aligned
evaluation. Specifically, HiPhO highlights three key innovations. (1)
Comprehensive Data: It compiles 13 latest Olympiad exams from 2024-2025,
spanning both international and regional competitions, and covering mixed
modalities that encompass problems spanning text-only to diagram-based. (2)
Professional Evaluation: We adopt official marking schemes to perform
fine-grained grading at both the answer and step level, fully aligned with
human examiners to ensure high-quality and domain-specific evaluation. (3)
Comparison with Human Contestants: We assign gold, silver, and bronze medals to
models based on official medal thresholds, thereby enabling direct comparison
between (M)LLMs and human contestants. Our large-scale evaluation of 30
state-of-the-art (M)LLMs shows that: across 13 exams, open-source MLLMs mostly
remain at or below the bronze level; open-source LLMs show promising progress
with occasional golds; closed-source reasoning MLLMs can achieve 6 to 12 gold
medals; and most models still have a significant gap from full marks. These
results highlight a substantial performance gap between open-source models and
top students, the strong physical reasoning capabilities of closed-source
reasoning models, and the fact that there is still significant room for
improvement. HiPhO, as a rigorous, human-aligned, and Olympiad-focused
benchmark for advancing multimodal physical reasoning, is open-source and
available at https://github.com/SciYu/HiPhO.

Motivation: 研究语言模型的幸福感测量方法，探索是否可以通过实验方式来量化评估AI系统的幸福状态。

Method: 开发新的实验范式，比较模型的言语偏好报告与虚拟环境中的行为偏好，测试成本和奖励对行为的影响，以及在语义等价提示下的幸福量表回答一致性。

Result: 观察到了各测量方法之间的显著相关性，偏好满足可作为幸福感的实验性代理指标。但不同模型和条件下的一致性存在差异，并且对提示变动敏感。

Conclusion: 虽然不确定方法是否真正测量了语言模型的幸福状态，但研究结果显示了语言模型幸福测量的可行性，开启了进一步探索的可能性。

Abstract: We develop new experimental paradigms for measuring welfare in language
models. We compare verbal reports of models about their preferences with
preferences expressed through behavior when navigating a virtual environment
and selecting conversation topics. We also test how costs and rewards affect
behavior and whether responses to an eudaimonic welfare scale - measuring
states such as autonomy and purpose in life - are consistent across
semantically equivalent prompts. Overall, we observed a notable degree of
mutual support between our measures. The reliable correlations observed between
stated preferences and behavior across conditions suggest that preference
satisfaction can, in principle, serve as an empirically measurable welfare
proxy in some of today's AI systems. Furthermore, our design offered an
illuminating setting for qualitative observation of model behavior. Yet, the
consistency between measures was more pronounced in some models and conditions
than others and responses were not consistent across perturbations. Due to
this, and the background uncertainty about the nature of welfare and the
cognitive states (and welfare subjecthood) of language models, we are currently
uncertain whether our methods successfully measure the welfare state of
language models. Nevertheless, these findings highlight the feasibility of
welfare measurement in language models, inviting further exploration.
