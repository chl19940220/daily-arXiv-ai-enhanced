Existing discourse\nemphasizes EV battery costs as being principally responsible for this price\ndifferential and widespread adoption is routinely conditioned upon battery\ncosts declining. We scrutinize such reasoning by sourcing data on EV attributes\nand market conditions between 2011 and 2023. Our findings are fourfold. First,\nEV prices are influenced principally by the number of amenities, additional\nfeatures, and dealer-installed accessories sold as standard on an EV, and to a\nlesser extent, by EV horsepower. Second, EV range is negatively correlated with\nEV price implying that range anxiety concerns may be less consequential than\nexisting discourse suggests. Third, battery capacity is positively correlated\nwith EV price, due to more capacity being synonymous with the delivery of more\nhorsepower.

To\naddress this limitation, we introduce Theory of Mind Augmented Persuader\n(ToMAP), a novel approach for building more flexible persuader agents by\nincorporating two theory of mind modules that enhance the persuader's awareness\nand analysis of the opponent's mental state. Specifically, we begin by\nprompting the persuader to consider possible objections to the target central\nclaim, and then use a text encoder paired with a trained MLP classifier to\npredict the opponent's current stance on these counterclaims. Our carefully\ndesigned reinforcement learning schema enables the persuader learns how to\nanalyze opponent-related information and utilize it to generate more effective\narguments. Experiments show that the ToMAP persuader, while containing only 3B\nparameters, outperforms much larger baselines, like GPT-4o, with a relative\ngain of 39.4% across multiple persuadee models and diverse corpora. Notably,\nToMAP exhibits complex reasoning chains and reduced repetition during training,\nwhich leads to more diverse and effective arguments. The opponent-aware feature\nof ToMAP also makes it suitable for long conversations and enables it to employ\nmore logical and opponent-aware strategies. These results underscore our\nmethod's effectiveness and highlight its potential for developing more\npersuasive language agents. Code is available at:\nhttps://github.com/ulab-uiuc/ToMAP."}

However, existing\nmethods typically focus on a single input modality, such as point clouds,\nimages, or text, which limits their generalizability and robustness. Leveraging\nrecent advances in vision-language models (VLM), we propose a multi-modal CAD\nreconstruction model that simultaneously processes all three input modalities.\nInspired by large language model (LLM) training paradigms, we adopt a two-stage\npipeline: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on large-scale procedurally generated\ndata, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning using online\nfeedback, obtained programatically. Furthermore, we are the first to explore RL\nfine-tuning of LLMs for CAD tasks demonstrating that online RL algorithms such\nas Group Relative Preference Optimization (GRPO) outperform offline\nalternatives. In the DeepCAD benchmark, our SFT model outperforms existing\nsingle-modal approaches in all three input modalities simultaneously.

However, accuracy\nmetrics alone do not support fine-grained assessment of capabilities and fail\nto reveal which problem-solving skills have been internalized. To better\nunderstand these capabilities, we propose to decompose problem solving into\nfundamental capabilities: Plan (mapping questions to sequences of steps),\nExecute (correctly performing solution steps), and Verify (identifying the\ncorrectness of a solution). Empirically, we find that GRPO mainly enhances the\nexecution skill-improving execution robustness on problems the model already\nknows how to solve-a phenomenon we call temperature distillation. More\nimportantly, we show that RL-trained models struggle with fundamentally new\nproblems, hitting a 'coverage wall' due to insufficient planning skills. To\nexplore RL's impact more deeply, we construct a minimal, synthetic\nsolution-tree navigation task as an analogy for mathematical problem-solving.\nThis controlled setup replicates our empirical findings, confirming RL\nprimarily boosts execution robustness. Importantly, in this setting, we\nidentify conditions under which RL can potentially overcome the coverage wall\nthrough improved exploration and generalization to new solution paths. Our\nfindings provide insights into the role of RL in enhancing LLM reasoning,\nexpose key limitations, and suggest a path toward overcoming these barriers.\nCode is available at https://github.com/cfpark00/RL-Wall."}

To address these\ngaps, we propose LLM-ODDR, a novel framework leveraging Large Language Models\n(LLMs) for joint Order Dispatching and Driver Repositioning (ODDR) in\nride-hailing services. LLM-ODDR framework comprises three key components: (1)\nMulti-objective-guided Order Value Refinement, which evaluates orders by\nconsidering multiple objectives to determine their overall value; (2)\nFairness-aware Order Dispatching, which balances platform revenue with driver\nincome fairness; and (3) Spatiotemporal Demand-Aware Driver Repositioning,\nwhich optimizes idle vehicle placement based on historical patterns and\nprojected supply. We also develop JointDR-GPT, a fine-tuned model optimized for\nODDR tasks with domain knowledge.
