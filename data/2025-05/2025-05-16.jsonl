We observe a lack of a unifying\ntheoretical framework that can coherently integrate these varied studies,\nespecially when tackling open-ended, complex tasks. To address this, we propose\na novel conceptual architecture: one that systematically interlinks the\ntechnical details of multi-agent coordination, knowledge management, cybernetic\nfeedback loops, and higher-level control mechanisms. By mapping existing\ncontributions, from symbolic AI techniques and connectionist LLM-based agents\nto hybrid organizational practices, onto this proposed framework (Hierarchical\nExploration-Exploitation Net), our approach facilitates revision of legacy\nmethods and inspires new work that fuses qualitative and quantitative\nparadigms. The paper's structure allows it to be read from any section, serving\nequally as a critical review of technical implementations and as a\nforward-looking reference for designing or extending human-AI symbioses.\nTogether, these insights offer a stepping stone toward deeper co-evolution of\nhuman cognition and AI capability."}

We conjecture that this observed improvement\nis partially due to the answer distribution of standard evaluation benchmarks,\nwhich is skewed towards a relatively small set of common answers. To test this\nconjecture, we define a baseline that enumerates answers according to their\nprevalence in the training set. Experiments spanning two domains --\nmathematical reasoning and factual knowledge -- reveal that this baseline\noutperforms repeated model sampling for some LLMs, while the coverage for\nothers is on par with that of a mixture strategy that obtains $k$ answers by\nusing only $10$ model samples and similarly guessing the remaining $k-10$\nattempts via enumeration. Our baseline enables a more accurate measurement of\nhow much repeated sampling improves coverage in such settings beyond\nprompt-agnostic guessing."}

However, existing methods overlook the trade-off between\nreasoning effectiveness and computational efficiency, often encouraging\nunnecessarily long reasoning chains and wasting tokens. To address this, we\npropose Learning to Think (L2T), an information-theoretic reinforcement\nfine-tuning framework for LLMs to make the models achieve optimal reasoning\nwith fewer tokens. Specifically, L2T treats each query-response interaction as\na hierarchical session of multiple episodes and proposes a universal dense\nprocess reward, i.e., quantifies the episode-wise information gain in\nparameters, requiring no extra annotations or task-specific evaluators. We\npropose a method to quickly estimate this reward based on PAC-Bayes bounds and\nthe Fisher information matrix. Theoretical analyses show that it significantly\nreduces computational complexity with high estimation accuracy. By immediately\nrewarding each episode's contribution and penalizing excessive updates, L2T\noptimizes the model via reinforcement learning to maximize the use of each\nepisode and achieve effective updates. Empirical results on various reasoning\nbenchmarks and base models demonstrate the advantage of L2T across different\ntasks, boosting both reasoning effectiveness and efficiency."}

In this work we\nintroduce J1, a reinforcement learning approach to training such models. Our\nmethod converts both verifiable and non-verifiable prompts to judgment tasks\nwith verifiable rewards that incentivize thinking and mitigate judgment bias.\nIn particular, our approach outperforms all other existing 8B or 70B models\nwhen trained at those sizes, including models distilled from DeepSeek-R1. J1\nalso outperforms o1-mini, and even R1 on some benchmarks, despite training a\nsmaller model. We provide analysis and ablations comparing Pairwise-J1 vs\nPointwise-J1 models, offline vs online training recipes, reward strategies,\nseed prompts, and variations in thought length and content.

However, when training reasoning models, these approaches are\nprimarily applicable to specific domains such as mathematics and programming,\nwhich imposes fundamental constraints on the breadth and scalability of\ntraining data. In contrast, continual pretraining (CPT) offers the advantage of\nnot requiring task-specific signals. Nevertheless, how to effectively\nsynthesize training data for reasoning and how such data affect a wide range of\ndomains remain largely unexplored. This study provides a detailed evaluation of\nReasoning CPT, a form of CPT that uses synthetic data to reconstruct the hidden\nthought processes underlying texts, based on the premise that texts are the\nresult of the author's thinking process. Specifically, we apply Reasoning CPT\nto Gemma2-9B using synthetic data with hidden thoughts derived from STEM and\nLaw corpora, and compare it to standard CPT on the MMLU benchmark. Our analysis\nreveals that Reasoning CPT consistently improves performance across all\nevaluated domains. Notably, reasoning skills acquired in one domain transfer\neffectively to others; the performance gap with conventional methods widens as\nproblem difficulty increases, with gains of up to 8 points on the most\nchallenging problems.

While\nrecent work demonstrates that large language models (LLMs) can mitigate this\nlimitation by generating synthetic experience (noted as imaginary rollouts) for\nmastering novel tasks, progress in this emerging field is hindered due to the\nlack of a standard benchmark. To bridge this gap, we introduce ImagineBench,\nthe first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating offline RL algorithms that\nleverage both real rollouts and LLM-imaginary rollouts. The key features of\nImagineBench include: (1) datasets comprising environment-collected and\nLLM-imaginary rollouts; (2) diverse domains of environments covering\nlocomotion, robotic manipulation, and navigation tasks; and (3) natural\nlanguage task instructions with varying complexity levels to facilitate\nlanguage-conditioned policy learning. Through systematic evaluation of\nstate-of-the-art offline RL algorithms, we observe that simply applying\nexisting offline RL algorithms leads to suboptimal performance on unseen tasks,\nachieving 35.44% success rate in hard tasks in contrast to 64.37% of method\ntraining on real rollouts for hard tasks. This result highlights the need for\nalgorithm advancements to better leverage LLM-imaginary rollouts. Additionally,\nwe identify key opportunities for future research: including better utilization\nof imaginary rollouts, fast online adaptation and continual learning, and\nextension to multi-modal tasks.

This paradigm distinctively addresses two major\nlimitations of traditional continual learning: (1) dynamic model updates using\nstreaming, real-time human-annotated data, rather than static datasets with\nfixed labels, and (2) the assumption of clean labels, by explicitly handling\nthe noisy feedback common in real-world interactions. To tackle these problems,\nwe propose RiCL, a Reinforced interactive Continual Learning framework\nleveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to learn new skills effectively from\ndynamic feedback. RiCL incorporates three key components: a temporal\nconsistency-aware purifier to automatically discern clean from noisy samples in\ndata streams; an interaction-aware direct preference optimization strategy to\nalign model behavior with human intent by reconciling AI-generated and\nhuman-provided feedback; and a noise-resistant contrastive learning module that\ncaptures robust representations by exploiting inherent data relationships, thus\navoiding reliance on potentially unreliable labels. Extensive experiments on\ntwo benchmark datasets (FewRel and TACRED), contaminated with realistic noise\npatterns, demonstrate that our RiCL approach substantially outperforms existing\ncombinations of state-of-the-art online continual learning and noisy-label\nlearning methods."}

Some of the existing adversarial attack methods search\nfor discrete tokens that may jailbreak a target model while others try to\noptimize the continuous space represented by the tokens of the model's\nvocabulary. While techniques based on the discrete space may prove to be\ninefficient, optimization of continuous token embeddings requires projections\nto produce discrete tokens, which might render them ineffective.
