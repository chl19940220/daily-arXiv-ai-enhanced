We observe a lack of a unifying\ntheoretical framework that can coherently integrate these varied studies,\nespecially when tackling open-ended, complex tasks. To address this, we propose\na novel conceptual architecture: one that systematically interlinks the\ntechnical details of multi-agent coordination, knowledge management, cybernetic\nfeedback loops, and higher-level control mechanisms. By mapping existing\ncontributions, from symbolic AI techniques and connectionist LLM-based agents\nto hybrid organizational practices, onto this proposed framework (Hierarchical\nExploration-Exploitation Net), our approach facilitates revision of legacy\nmethods and inspires new work that fuses qualitative and quantitative\nparadigms. The paper's structure allows it to be read from any section, serving\nequally as a critical review of technical implementations and as a\nforward-looking reference for designing or extending human-AI symbioses.\nTogether, these insights offer a stepping stone toward deeper co-evolution of\nhuman cognition and AI capability."}

Despite wide success of RL, training effective\nagents remains difficult due to the multitude of factors requiring careful\ntuning, such as algorithm selection, hyperparameter settings, and even random\nseed choices, all of which can significantly influence an agent's performance.\nModel ensemble helps overcome this challenge by combining multiple weak agents\ninto a single, more powerful one, enhancing overall performance. However,\nexisting ensemble methods, such as majority voting and Boltzmann addition, are\ndesigned as fixed strategies and lack a semantic understanding of specific\ntasks, limiting their adaptability and effectiveness. To address this, we\npropose LLM-Ens, a novel approach that enhances RL model ensemble with\ntask-specific semantic understandings driven by large language models (LLMs).\nGiven a task, we first design an LLM to categorize states in this task into\ndistinct 'situations', incorporating high-level descriptions of the task\nconditions. Then, we statistically analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each\nindividual agent to be used in the ensemble in each situation. During the\ninference time, LLM-Ens dynamically identifies the changing task situation and\nswitches to the agent that performs best in the current situation, ensuring\ndynamic model selection in the evolving task condition. Our approach is\ndesigned to be compatible with agents trained with different random seeds,\nhyperparameter settings, and various RL algorithms. Extensive experiments on\nthe Atari benchmark show that LLM-Ens significantly improves the RL model\nensemble, surpassing well-known baselines by up to 20.9%.

Inspired by the analyzing and reasoning capability of large\nlanguage models (LLMs), we design LLM-Explorer to adaptively generate\ntask-specific exploration strategies with LLMs, enhancing the policy\nexploration in RL.

Moreover, instead of\ntrading off pass@1 performance for pass@k gains, our method allows annealing k\nduring training, optimizing both metrics and often achieving strong pass@1\nnumbers alongside significant pass@k gains.\n  We validate our reward transformations on toy experiments, which reveal the\nvariance reducing properties of our formulations.

However,\ncurrent RL post-training methods for LLMs typically use verifiers that are\nfixed (rule-based or frozen pretrained) or trained discriminatively via\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT). Such designs are susceptible to reward hacking\nand generalize poorly beyond their training distributions. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose Tango, a novel framework that uses RL to concurrently\ntrain both an LLM generator and a verifier in an interleaved manner. A central\ninnovation of Tango is its generative, process-level LLM verifier, which is\ntrained via RL and co-evolves with the generator. Importantly, the verifier is\ntrained solely based on outcome-level verification correctness rewards without\nrequiring explicit process-level annotations. This generative RL-trained\nverifier exhibits improved robustness and superior generalization compared to\ndeterministic or SFT-trained verifiers, fostering effective mutual\nreinforcement with the generator.
