Unlike\nexisting benchmarks that primarily rely on static datasets or single-attempt\nevaluations, MLE-Dojo provides an interactive environment enabling agents to\niteratively experiment, debug, and refine solutions through structured feedback\nloops. Built upon 200+ real-world Kaggle challenges, MLE-Dojo covers diverse,\nopen-ended MLE tasks carefully curated to reflect realistic engineering\nscenarios such as data processing, architecture search, hyperparameter tuning,\nand code debugging. Its fully executable environment supports comprehensive\nagent training via both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning,\nfacilitating iterative experimentation, realistic data sampling, and real-time\noutcome verification. Extensive evaluations of eight frontier LLMs reveal that\nwhile current models achieve meaningful iterative improvements, they still\nexhibit significant limitations in autonomously generating long-horizon\nsolutions and efficiently resolving complex errors. Furthermore, MLE-Dojo's\nflexible and extensible architecture seamlessly integrates diverse data\nsources, tools, and evaluation protocols, uniquely enabling model-based agent\ntuning and promoting interoperability, scalability, and reproducibility. We\nopen-source our framework and benchmarks to foster community-driven innovation\ntowards next-generation MLE agents."}

At the core of our approach is an adaptive caching mechanism,\nwhere cache parameters are meta-optimized using surrogate gradients derived\nfrom policy performance. This design enables efficient inference across both\ndiscrete text environments (e.g., TextWorld, ALFWorld) and continuous control\ndomains (e.g., MuJoCo), achieving a 3.8--4.7$\\times$ reduction in LLM queries\nand 4.0--12.0$\\times$ lower median latencies (85--93\\,ms on a consumer GPU)\nwhile retaining 96--98\\% of uncached performance.

Central to this being efficient\nis the ability for FL to perform sparse gradient updates and remote direct\nmemory access at the central server. Most of the research in FL security\nfocuses on protecting data privacy at the edge client or in the communication\nchannels between the client and server. Client-facing attacks on the server are\nless well investigated as the assumption is that a large collective of clients\noffer resilience.\n  Here, we show that by attacking certain clients that lead to a high frequency\nrepetitive memory update in the server, we can remote initiate a rowhammer\nattack on the server memory. For the first time, we do not need backdoor access\nto the server, and a reinforcement learning (RL) attacker can learn how to\nmaximize server repetitive memory updates by manipulating the client's sensor\nobservation. The consequence of the remote rowhammer attack is that we are able\nto achieve bit flips, which can corrupt the server memory. We demonstrate the\nfeasibility of our attack using a large-scale FL automatic speech recognition\n(ASR) systems with sparse updates, our adversarial attacking agent can achieve\naround 70\\% repeated update rate (RUR) in the targeted server model,\neffectively inducing bit flips on server DRAM. The security implications are\nthat can cause disruptions to learning or may inadvertently cause elevated\nprivilege. This paves the way for further research on practical mitigation\nstrategies in FL and hardware design."}
