We observe a lack of a unifying\ntheoretical framework that can coherently integrate these varied studies,\nespecially when tackling open-ended, complex tasks. To address this, we propose\na novel conceptual architecture: one that systematically interlinks the\ntechnical details of multi-agent coordination, knowledge management, cybernetic\nfeedback loops, and higher-level control mechanisms. By mapping existing\ncontributions, from symbolic AI techniques and connectionist LLM-based agents\nto hybrid organizational practices, onto this proposed framework (Hierarchical\nExploration-Exploitation Net), our approach facilitates revision of legacy\nmethods and inspires new work that fuses qualitative and quantitative\nparadigms.

Existing discourse\nemphasizes EV battery costs as being principally responsible for this price\ndifferential and widespread adoption is routinely conditioned upon battery\ncosts declining. We scrutinize such reasoning by sourcing data on EV attributes\nand market conditions between 2011 and 2023. Our findings are fourfold. First,\nEV prices are influenced principally by the number of amenities, additional\nfeatures, and dealer-installed accessories sold as standard on an EV, and to a\nlesser extent, by EV horsepower. Second, EV range is negatively correlated with\nEV price implying that range anxiety concerns may be less consequential than\nexisting discourse suggests. Third, battery capacity is positively correlated\nwith EV price, due to more capacity being synonymous with the delivery of more\nhorsepower. Collectively, this suggests that higher procurement prices for EVs\nreflects consumer preference for vehicles that are feature dense and more\npowerful.

With a long\ncontext length, LLMs may learn to perform search, as indicated by the\nself-correction behavior observed in DeepSeek R1. However, this search behavior\nis often imprecise and lacks confidence, resulting in long, redundant responses\nand highlighting deficiencies in intuition and verification. Inspired by the\nDual Process Theory in psychology, we introduce a simple modification to the QA\ntask that includes four stages: Fast Thinking, where the LLM must answer within\na strict token budget; Verification, where the model evaluates its initial\nresponse; Slow Thinking, where it refines the initial response with more\ndeliberation; and Summarization, where it distills the refinement from the\nprevious stage into precise steps. Our proposed task improves average accuracy\nfrom 24.9% to 27.9% for Qwen2.5-1.5B, and from 45.9% to 49.8% for\nDeepSeek-R1-Qwen-1.5B. Notably, for Qwen2.5-1.5B, the Fast Thinking mode alone\nachieves 26.8% accuracy using fewer than 1000 tokens, demonstrating substantial\ninference efficiency gains. These findings suggest that intuition and\ndeliberative reasoning are distinct, complementary systems benefiting from\ntargeted training."}

However, a critical challenge when applying RL to\nthese agentic tasks arises from delayed rewards: feedback signals are typically\navailable only after the entire task is completed. This makes it non-trivial to\nassign delayed rewards to earlier actions, providing insufficient guidance\nregarding environmental constraints and hindering agent training. In this work,\nwe draw on the insight that the ultimate completion of a task emerges from the\ncumulative progress an agent makes across individual steps. We propose Stepwise\nProgress Attribution (SPA), a general reward redistribution framework that\ndecomposes the final reward into stepwise contributions, each reflecting its\nincremental progress toward overall task completion. To achieve this, we train\na progress estimator that accumulates stepwise contributions over a trajectory\nto match the task completion. During policy optimization, we combine the\nestimated per-step contribution with a grounding signal for actions executed in\nthe environment as the fine-grained, intermediate reward for effective agent\ntraining. Extensive experiments on common agent benchmarks (including Webshop,\nALFWorld, and VirtualHome) demonstrate that SPA consistently outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art method in both success rate (+2.5\\% on average) and grounding\naccuracy (+1.9\\% on average). Further analyses demonstrate that our method\nremarkably provides more effective intermediate rewards for RL training. Our\ncode is available at https://github.com/WangHanLinHenry/SPA-RL-Agent."}

However,\nstate-of-the-art policy optimization methods often suffer from high\ncomputational overhead and memory consumption, primarily due to the need for\nmultiple generations per prompt and the reliance on critic networks or\nadvantage estimates of the current policy. In this paper, we propose $A$*-PO, a\nnovel two-stage policy optimization framework that directly approximates the\noptimal advantage function and enables efficient training of LLMs for reasoning\ntasks. In the first stage, we leverage offline sampling from a reference policy\nto estimate the optimal value function $V$*, eliminating the need for costly\nonline value estimation. In the second stage, we perform on-policy updates\nusing a simple least-squares regression loss with only a single generation per\nprompt. Theoretically, we establish performance guarantees and prove that the\nKL-regularized RL objective can be optimized without requiring complex\nexploration strategies. Empirically, $A$*-PO achieves competitive performance\nacross a wide range of mathematical reasoning benchmarks, while reducing\ntraining time by up to 2$\\times$ and peak memory usage by over 30% compared to\nPPO, GRPO, and REBEL.

In this work, we design a\nlarge language model-guided policy modulation framework that leverages LLMs to\nimprove RL training without additional model training or human intervention. We\nfirst prompt an LLM to identify critical states from a sub-optimal agent's\ntrajectories.
