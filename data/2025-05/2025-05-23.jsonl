We conjecture that this observed improvement\nis partially due to the answer distribution of standard evaluation benchmarks,\nwhich is skewed towards a relatively small set of common answers. To test this\nconjecture, we define a baseline that enumerates answers according to their\nprevalence in the training set. Experiments spanning two domains --\nmathematical reasoning and factual knowledge -- reveal that this baseline\noutperforms repeated model sampling for some LLMs, while the coverage for\nothers is on par with that of a mixture strategy that obtains $k$ answers by\nusing only $10$ model samples and similarly guessing the remaining $k-10$\nattempts via enumeration. Our baseline enables a more accurate measurement of\nhow much repeated sampling improves coverage in such settings beyond\nprompt-agnostic guessing."}

By mapping existing\ncontributions, from symbolic AI techniques and connectionist LLM-based agents\nto hybrid organizational practices, onto this proposed framework (Hierarchical\nExploration-Exploitation Net), our approach facilitates revision of legacy\nmethods and inspires new work that fuses qualitative and quantitative\nparadigms.

Two prominent RL algorithms, Direct Preference\nOptimization (DPO) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), are central\nto these developments, showcasing different pros and cons. Autoregressive image\ngeneration, also interpretable as a sequential CoT reasoning process, presents\nunique challenges distinct from LLM-based CoT reasoning. These encompass\nensuring text-image consistency, improving image aesthetic quality, and\ndesigning sophisticated reward models, rather than relying on simpler\nrule-based rewards. While recent efforts have extended RL to this domain, these\nexplorations typically lack an in-depth analysis of the domain-specific\nchallenges and the characteristics of different RL strategies. To bridge this\ngap, we provide the first comprehensive investigation of the GRPO and DPO\nalgorithms in autoregressive image generation, evaluating their in-domain\nperformance and out-of-domain generalization, while scrutinizing the impact of\ndifferent reward models on their respective capabilities. Our findings reveal\nthat GRPO and DPO exhibit distinct advantages, and crucially, that reward\nmodels possessing stronger intrinsic generalization capabilities potentially\nenhance the generalization potential of the applied RL algorithms. Furthermore,\nwe systematically explore three prevalent scaling strategies to enhance both\ntheir in-domain and out-of-domain proficiency, deriving unique insights into\nefficiently scaling performance for each paradigm.
