### [1] [HOLODECK 2.0: Vision-Language-Guided 3D World Generation with Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05899)
*Zixuan Bian,Ruohan Ren,Yue Yang,Chris Callison-Burch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HOLODECK 2.0是一个先进的视觉语言引导框架，用于生成3D场景并支持基于人类反馈的交互式编辑，能够生成多样且风格丰富的场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D场景生成依赖大量人工，现有自动化方法难以生成开放域场景或支持灵活编辑，因此需要直接从文本生成3D世界。

Method: HOLODECK 2.0利用视觉语言模型（VLMs）识别和解析场景中的对象，并通过先进的3D生成模型生成高质量资产，结合空间约束实现语义和物理合理的布局。

Result: 通过人类评估和CLIP评估，HOLODECK 2.0生成的场景与详细文本描述高度一致，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: HOLODECK 2.0在游戏建模等应用中展示了高效生成沉浸式环境的潜力。

Abstract: 3D scene generation plays a crucial role in gaming, artistic creation,
virtual reality and many other domains. However, current 3D scene design still
relies heavily on extensive manual effort from creators, and existing automated
methods struggle to generate open-domain scenes or support flexible editing. As
a result, generating 3D worlds directly from text has garnered increasing
attention. In this paper, we introduce HOLODECK 2.0, an advanced
vision-language-guided framework for 3D world generation with support for
interactive scene editing based on human feedback. HOLODECK 2.0 can generate
diverse and stylistically rich 3D scenes (e.g., realistic, cartoon, anime, and
cyberpunk styles) that exhibit high semantic fidelity to fine-grained input
descriptions, suitable for both indoor and open-domain environments. HOLODECK
2.0 leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to identify and parse the objects
required in a scene and generates corresponding high-quality assets via
state-of-the-art 3D generative models. It then iteratively applies spatial
constraints derived from the VLMs to achieve semantically coherent and
physically plausible layouts. Human evaluations and CLIP-based assessments
demonstrate that HOLODECK 2.0 effectively generates high-quality scenes closely
aligned with detailed textual descriptions, consistently outperforming
baselines across indoor and open-domain scenarios. Additionally, we provide
editing capabilities that flexibly adapt to human feedback, supporting layout
refinement and style-consistent object edits. Finally, we present a practical
application of HOLODECK 2.0 in procedural game modeling, generating visually
rich and immersive environments, potentially boosting efficiency.

### [2] [LV-Net: Anatomy-aware lateral ventricle shape modeling with a case study on Alzheimer's disease, the Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle flagship study of ageing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06055)
*Wonjung Park,Suhyun Ahn,Jinah Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LV-Net是一种从脑MRI生成个性化3D侧脑室（LV）网格的新框架，通过变形联合LV-海马模板网格，减少分割伪影并提高重建鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 侧脑室形状分析作为神经系统疾病的生物标志物具有潜力，但由于个体间形状差异大和MRI分辨率限制导致分割困难，需要更稳健的方法。

Method: LV-Net通过变形联合LV-海马模板网格，利用解剖关系减少分割伪影，并通过模板网格顶点分类增强点对应性。

Result: LV-Net在分割不完美情况下仍实现高重建精度，并在阿尔茨海默病分析中识别出与疾病显著相关的LV子区域。

Conclusion: LV-Net为LV形状分析提供了更准确和可靠的工具，适用于神经系统疾病研究。

Abstract: Lateral ventricle (LV) shape analysis holds promise as a biomarker for
neurological diseases; however, challenges remain due to substantial shape
variability across individuals and segmentation difficulties arising from
limited MRI resolution. We introduce LV-Net, a novel framework for producing
individualized 3D LV meshes from brain MRI by deforming an anatomy-aware joint
LV-hippocampus template mesh. By incorporating anatomical relationships
embedded within the joint template, LV-Net reduces boundary segmentation
artifacts and improves reconstruction robustness. In addition, by classifying
the vertices of the template mesh based on their anatomical adjacency, our
method enhances point correspondence across subjects, leading to more accurate
LV shape statistics. We demonstrate that LV-Net achieves superior
reconstruction accuracy, even in the presence of segmentation imperfections,
and delivers more reliable shape descriptors across diverse datasets. Finally,
we apply LV-Net to Alzheimer's disease analysis, identifying LV subregions that
show significantly associations with the disease relative to cognitively normal
controls. The codes for LV shape modeling are available at
https://github.com/PWonjung/LV_Shape_Modeling.

### [3] [Boosting Adversarial Transferability via Residual Perturbation Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05689)
*Jinjia Peng,Zeze Tao,Huibing Wang,Meng Wang,Yang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ResPA的新型攻击方法，通过利用残差梯度作为扰动方向，提升对抗样本在目标模型中的可迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽略了扰动方向的影响，导致对抗样本的可迁移性受限。

Method: ResPA通过指数移动平均获取参考梯度，并利用当前梯度与参考梯度的残差来捕捉全局扰动方向的变化。

Result: 实验证明ResPA的可迁移性优于现有方法，且结合输入变换方法可进一步提升效果。

Conclusion: ResPA通过考虑全局扰动方向，显著提高了对抗样本的可迁移性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are susceptible to adversarial examples while suffering
from incorrect predictions via imperceptible perturbations. Transfer-based
attacks create adversarial examples for surrogate models and transfer these
examples to target models under black-box scenarios. Recent studies reveal that
adversarial examples in flat loss landscapes exhibit superior transferability
to alleviate overfitting on surrogate models. However, the prior arts overlook
the influence of perturbation directions, resulting in limited transferability.
In this paper, we propose a novel attack method, named Residual Perturbation
Attack (ResPA), relying on the residual gradient as the perturbation direction
to guide the adversarial examples toward the flat regions of the loss function.
Specifically, ResPA conducts an exponential moving average on the input
gradients to obtain the first moment as the reference gradient, which
encompasses the direction of historical gradients. Instead of heavily relying
on the local flatness that stems from the current gradients as the perturbation
direction, ResPA further considers the residual between the current gradient
and the reference gradient to capture the changes in the global perturbation
direction. The experimental results demonstrate the better transferability of
ResPA than the existing typical transfer-based attack methods, while the
transferability can be further improved by combining ResPA with the current
input transformation methods. The code is available at
https://github.com/ZezeTao/ResPA.

### [4] [Generalized Few-Shot Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05732)
*Pinxuan Li,Bing Cao,Changqing Zhang,Qinghua Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种广义少样本OOD检测框架（GOOD），通过引入通用知识模型（GKM）提升模型的泛化能力，解决了现有方法因少样本学习导致的过拟合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有少样本OOD检测方法在开放世界中的泛化能力不足，容易因训练数据有限而过拟合，导致性能下降。

Method: 提出了GOOD框架，利用GKM增强模型的通用知识，并设计了知识动态嵌入（KDE）机制，动态调整通用知识的引导。

Result: 在真实OOD基准测试中表现优异，理论证明了GS平衡可降低泛化误差上界。

Conclusion: GOOD框架通过GKM和KDE机制有效提升了少样本OOD检测的泛化能力。

Abstract: Few-shot Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection has emerged as a critical
research direction in machine learning for practical deployment. Most existing
Few-shot OOD detection methods suffer from insufficient generalization
capability for the open world. Due to the few-shot learning paradigm, the OOD
detection ability is often overfit to the limited training data itself, thus
degrading the performance on generalized data and performing inconsistently
across different scenarios. To address this challenge, we proposed a
Generalized Few-shot OOD Detection (GOOD) framework, which empowers the general
knowledge of the OOD detection model with an auxiliary General Knowledge Model
(GKM), instead of directly learning from few-shot data. We proceed to reveal
the few-shot OOD detection from a generalization perspective and theoretically
derive the Generality-Specificity balance (GS-balance) for OOD detection, which
provably reduces the upper bound of generalization error with a general
knowledge model. Accordingly, we propose a Knowledge Dynamic Embedding (KDE)
mechanism to adaptively modulate the guidance of general knowledge. KDE
dynamically aligns the output distributions of the OOD detection model to the
general knowledge model based on the Generalized Belief (G-Belief) of GKM,
thereby boosting the GS-balance. Experiments on real-world OOD benchmarks
demonstrate our superiority. Codes will be available.

### [5] [UnGuide: Learning to Forget with LoRA-Guided Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05755)
*Agnieszka Polowczyk,Alicja Polowczyk,Dawid Malarz,Artur Kasymov,Marcin Mazur,Jacek Tabor,Przemysław Spurek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UnGuide提出了一种动态推理机制UnGuidance，结合LoRA适配器，实现了对扩散模型中特定知识的精确遗忘，同时保持模型整体性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模文本到图像扩散模型的潜在滥用风险，尤其是生成有害或误导性内容，亟需有效的机器遗忘方法。

Method: UnGuide通过动态调整Classifier-Free Guidance（CFG）的引导尺度，结合LoRA适配器，选择性遗忘特定概念。

Result: UnGuide在概念移除任务中表现优异，既能精确遗忘目标内容，又保持了图像的真实性和模型的表达能力。

Conclusion: UnGuide为扩散模型的机器遗忘提供了一种高效且可控的解决方案，优于现有基于LoRA的方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale text-to-image diffusion models have heightened
concerns about their potential misuse, especially in generating harmful or
misleading content. This underscores the urgent need for effective machine
unlearning, i.e., removing specific knowledge or concepts from pretrained
models without compromising overall performance. One possible approach is
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which offers an efficient means to fine-tune models
for targeted unlearning. However, LoRA often inadvertently alters unrelated
content, leading to diminished image fidelity and realism. To address this
limitation, we introduce UnGuide -- a novel approach which incorporates
UnGuidance, a dynamic inference mechanism that leverages Classifier-Free
Guidance (CFG) to exert precise control over the unlearning process. UnGuide
modulates the guidance scale based on the stability of a few first steps of
denoising processes, enabling selective unlearning by LoRA adapter. For prompts
containing the erased concept, the LoRA module predominates and is
counterbalanced by the base model; for unrelated prompts, the base model
governs generation, preserving content fidelity. Empirical results demonstrate
that UnGuide achieves controlled concept removal and retains the expressive
power of diffusion models, outperforming existing LoRA-based methods in both
object erasure and explicit content removal tasks.

### [6] [Improving Masked Style Transfer using Blended Partial Convolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05769)
*Seyed Hadi Seyed,Ayberk Cansever,David Hart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于部分卷积的风格迁移网络，专注于对图像特定区域进行风格化，避免了传统方法在区域风格化中的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法对整个图像进行风格迁移后通过掩码处理特定区域，但这种方式无法准确捕捉目标区域的风格特征。

Method: 采用部分卷积的风格迁移网络，并结合网络内部混合技术以处理区域选择的不完美。

Result: 在SA-1B数据集上验证了该方法在视觉和定量上的改进。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了特定区域风格化的准确性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Artistic style transfer has long been possible with the advancements of
convolution- and transformer-based neural networks. Most algorithms apply the
artistic style transfer to the whole image, but individual users may only need
to apply a style transfer to a specific region in the image. The standard
practice is to simply mask the image after the stylization. This work shows
that this approach tends to improperly capture the style features in the region
of interest. We propose a partial-convolution-based style transfer network that
accurately applies the style features exclusively to the region of interest.
Additionally, we present network-internal blending techniques that account for
imperfections in the region selection. We show that this visually and
quantitatively improves stylization using examples from the SA-1B dataset. Code
is publicly available at https://github.com/davidmhart/StyleTransferMasked.

### [7] [MAISI-v2: Accelerated 3D High-Resolution Medical Image Synthesis with Rectified Flow and Region-specific Contrastive Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05772)
*Can Zhao,Pengfei Guo,Dong Yang,Yucheng Tang,Yufan He,Benjamin Simon,Mason Belue,Stephanie Harmon,Baris Turkbey,Daguang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAISI-v2是一个加速的3D医学图像合成框架，通过整合rectified flow实现快速高质量生成，并引入区域特异性对比损失提升条件一致性。实验表明其图像质量达到SOTA，推理速度提升33倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学图像合成方法存在泛化性差、推理速度慢和输入条件对齐弱的问题，MAISI-v2旨在解决这些问题。

Method: MAISI-v2整合rectified flow加速生成，并引入区域特异性对比损失增强条件一致性。

Result: MAISI-v2在图像质量上达到SOTA，推理速度提升33倍，下游分割实验验证了合成图像的数据增强效果。

Conclusion: MAISI-v2在医学图像合成中实现了高效、高质量和强条件一致性的平衡，代码和模型已开源以促进社区发展。

Abstract: Medical image synthesis is an important topic for both clinical and research
applications. Recently, diffusion models have become a leading approach in this
area. Despite their strengths, many existing methods struggle with (1) limited
generalizability that only work for specific body regions or voxel spacings,
(2) slow inference, which is a common issue for diffusion models, and (3) weak
alignment with input conditions, which is a critical issue for medical imaging.
MAISI, a previously proposed framework, addresses generalizability issues but
still suffers from slow inference and limited condition consistency. In this
work, we present MAISI-v2, the first accelerated 3D medical image synthesis
framework that integrates rectified flow to enable fast and high quality
generation. To further enhance condition fidelity, we introduce a novel
region-specific contrastive loss to enhance the sensitivity to region of
interest. Our experiments show that MAISI-v2 can achieve SOTA image quality
with $33 \times$ acceleration for latent diffusion model. We also conducted a
downstream segmentation experiment to show that the synthetic images can be
used for data augmentation. We release our code, training details, model
weights, and a GUI demo to facilitate reproducibility and promote further
development within the community.

### [8] [Few-Shot Deployment of Pretrained MRI Transformers in Brain Imaging Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05783)
*Mengyu Li,Guoyao Shen,Chad W. Farris,Xin Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于预训练MRI变换器的少样本部署框架，结合MAE预训练策略和轻量级线性头或混合架构MAE-FUnet，在数据有限条件下实现高效、稳定的医学影像任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学影像中标注数据稀缺问题，提升预训练模型在真实世界中的适用性。

Method: 采用MAE预训练策略在大规模多队列脑MRI数据集上获取可迁移的潜在表示；针对分类任务使用冻结MAE编码器加轻量级线性头；针对分割任务提出混合架构MAE-FUnet。

Result: 在MRI序列识别任务中达到SOTA准确率；在分割任务中优于其他基线模型，适用于低资源临床环境。

Conclusion: 该框架高效、稳定且可扩展，适合低资源临床环境和广泛的神经影像应用。

Abstract: Machine learning using transformers has shown great potential in medical
imaging, but its real-world applicability remains limited due to the scarcity
of annotated data. In this study, we propose a practical framework for the
few-shot deployment of pretrained MRI transformers in diverse brain imaging
tasks. By utilizing the Masked Autoencoder (MAE) pretraining strategy on a
large-scale, multi-cohort brain MRI dataset comprising over 31 million slices,
we obtain highly transferable latent representations that generalize well
across tasks and datasets. For high-level tasks such as classification, a
frozen MAE encoder combined with a lightweight linear head achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy in MRI sequence identification with minimal
supervision. For low-level tasks such as segmentation, we propose MAE-FUnet, a
hybrid architecture that fuses multiscale CNN features with pretrained MAE
embeddings. This model consistently outperforms other strong baselines in both
skull stripping and multi-class anatomical segmentation under data-limited
conditions. With extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations, our
framework demonstrates efficiency, stability, and scalability, suggesting its
suitability for low-resource clinical environments and broader neuroimaging
applications.

### [9] [Optimization-Free Style Transfer for 3D Gaussian Splats](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05813)
*Raphael Du Sablon,David Hart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种无需重建或优化的3D高斯样条风格迁移方法，通过生成图结构并插值实现快速风格化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需重建或优化样条，效率低且依赖额外训练。

Method: 生成样条隐式表面的图结构，使用前馈表面风格化方法并插值回样条。

Result: 实现快速风格化（2分钟内），支持任意风格图像和样条。

Conclusion: 方法高效、通用，优于现有3D高斯样条风格迁移技术。

Abstract: The task of style transfer for 3D Gaussian splats has been explored in many
previous works, but these require reconstructing or fine-tuning the splat while
incorporating style information or optimizing a feature extraction network on
the splat representation. We propose a reconstruction- and optimization-free
approach to stylizing 3D Gaussian splats. This is done by generating a graph
structure across the implicit surface of the splat representation. A
feed-forward, surface-based stylization method is then used and interpolated
back to the individual splats in the scene. This allows for any style image and
3D Gaussian splat to be used without any additional training or optimization.
This also allows for fast stylization of splats, achieving speeds under 2
minutes even on consumer-grade hardware. We demonstrate the quality results
this approach achieves and compare to other 3D Gaussian splat style transfer
methods. Code is publicly available at
https://github.com/davidmhart/FastSplatStyler.

### [10] [MZEN: Multi-Zoom Enhanced NeRF for 3-D Reconstruction with Unknown Camera Poses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05819)
*Jong-Ik Park,Carlee Joe-Wong,Gary K. Fedder*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MZEN是一种改进的NeRF框架，通过处理多缩放图像集，提升工业检测中的精细结构重建能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NeRF方法在多视角2D图像重建3D场景中表现优异，但在工业检测中无法捕捉到微米级细节。MZEN旨在解决这一问题。

Method: MZEN引入可学习的缩放标量扩展相机模型，并提出一种新的姿态策略：先解决广角图像建立全局坐标系，再通过缩放一致裁剪匹配处理放大图像。

Result: 在多种场景下，MZEN显著优于基线方法，PSNR提升28%，SSIM提升10%，LPIPS降低222%。

Conclusion: MZEN扩展了NeRF在工业检测中的应用，既能保持全局精度，又能捕捉微米级细节。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) methods excel at 3D reconstruction from
multiple 2D images, even those taken with unknown camera poses. However, they
still miss the fine-detailed structures that matter in industrial inspection,
e.g., detecting sub-micron defects on a production line or analyzing chips with
Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). In these scenarios, the sensor resolution
is fixed and compute budgets are tight, so the only way to expose fine
structure is to add zoom-in images; yet, this breaks the multi-view consistency
that pose-free NeRF training relies on. We propose Multi-Zoom Enhanced NeRF
(MZEN), the first NeRF framework that natively handles multi-zoom image sets.
MZEN (i) augments the pin-hole camera model with an explicit, learnable zoom
scalar that scales the focal length, and (ii) introduces a novel pose strategy:
wide-field images are solved first to establish a global metric frame, and
zoom-in images are then pose-primed to the nearest wide-field counterpart via a
zoom-consistent crop-and-match procedure before joint refinement. Across eight
forward-facing scenes$\unicode{x2013}$synthetic TCAD models, real SEM of
micro-structures, and BLEFF objects$\unicode{x2013}$MZEN consistently
outperforms pose-free baselines and even high-resolution variants, boosting
PSNR by up to $28 \%$, SSIM by $10 \%$, and reducing LPIPS by up to $222 \%$.
MZEN, therefore, extends NeRF to real-world factory settings, preserving global
accuracy while capturing the micron-level details essential for industrial
inspection.

### [11] [TSMS-SAM2: Multi-scale Temporal Sampling Augmentation and Memory-Splitting Pruning for Promptable Video Object Segmentation and Tracking in Surgical Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05829)
*Guoping Xu,Hua-Chieh Shao,You Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TSMS-SAM2是一种改进的可提示视频对象分割与跟踪框架，针对手术视频中的快速运动和内存冗余问题，通过多时间尺度采样和内存分割修剪机制提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手术视频分析中，复杂运动动态和内存冗余限制了基础模型（如SAM2）的应用效果。

Method: 提出TSMS-SAM2框架，采用多时间尺度视频采样增强和内存分割修剪机制。

Result: 在EndoVis2017和EndoVis2018数据集上分别达到95.24和86.73的平均Dice分数，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TSMS-SAM2在复杂手术场景中展现出高效、鲁棒的分割潜力，多尺度时间增强和内存分割策略有效。

Abstract: Promptable video object segmentation and tracking (VOST) has seen significant
advances with the emergence of foundation models like Segment Anything Model 2
(SAM2); however, their application in surgical video analysis remains
challenging due to complex motion dynamics and the redundancy of memory that
impedes effective learning. In this work, we propose TSMS-SAM2, a novel
framework that enhances promptable VOST in surgical videos by addressing
challenges of rapid object motion and memory redundancy in SAM2. TSMS-SAM2
introduces two key strategies: multi-temporal-scale video sampling augmentation
to improve robustness against motion variability, and a memory splitting and
pruning mechanism that organizes and filters past frame features for more
efficient and accurate segmentation. Evaluated on EndoVis2017 and EndoVis2018
datasets, TSMS-SAM2 achieved the highest mean Dice scores of 95.24 and 86.73,
respectively, outperforming prior SAM-based and task-specific methods.
Extensive ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of multiscale temporal
augmentation and memory splitting, highlighting the framework's potential for
robust, efficient segmentation in complex surgical scenarios. Our source code
will be available at https://github.com/apple1986/TSMS-SAM2.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为TCA的轻量级策略，通过利用帧间时间一致性优化视频分割中的token聚类，显著减少计算量并保持细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Swin Transformer在视频分割中计算成本高，现有token减少方法无法充分利用时间冗余。

Method: 提出TCA策略，通过时间相关性优化token聚类，避免冗余token丢弃。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，TCA提升了现有聚类方法的精度与速度平衡。

Conclusion: TCA在自然和特定领域视频中均表现优异，是一种高效且无需微调的优化方法。

Abstract: Vision Transformers have substantially advanced the capabilities of
segmentation models across both image and video domains. Among them, the Swin
Transformer stands out for its ability to capture hierarchical, multi-scale
representations, making it a popular backbone for segmentation in videos.
However, despite its window-attention scheme, it still incurs a high
computational cost, especially in larger variants commonly used for dense
prediction in videos. This remains a major bottleneck for real-time,
resource-constrained applications. Whilst token reduction methods have been
proposed to alleviate this, the window-based attention mechanism of Swin
requires a fixed number of tokens per window, limiting the applicability of
conventional pruning techniques. Meanwhile, training-free token clustering
approaches have shown promise in image segmentation while maintaining window
consistency. Nevertheless, they fail to exploit temporal redundancy, missing a
key opportunity to further optimize video segmentation performance. We
introduce Temporal Cluster Assignment (TCA), a lightweight and effective,
fine-tuning-free strategy that enhances token clustering by leveraging temporal
coherence across frames. Instead of indiscriminately dropping redundant tokens,
TCA refines token clusters using temporal correlations, thereby retaining
fine-grained details while significantly reducing computation. Extensive
evaluations on YouTube-VIS 2019, YouTube-VIS 2021, OVIS, and a private surgical
video dataset show that TCA consistently boosts the accuracy-speed trade-off of
existing clustering-based methods. Our results demonstrate that TCA generalizes
competently across both natural and domain-specific videos.

*Kaiser Hamid,Khandakar Ashrafi Akbar,Nade Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉-语言的框架，通过自然语言建模驾驶员注视变化，利用少样本和零样本学习在静态RGB图像上预测视觉注意力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注静态图像的注意力分配，缺乏对动态注视变化的建模，且缺乏可解释性。

Method: 结合人类反馈优化BDD-A数据集的高质量标注，微调LLaVA模型，整合低层线索和顶层上下文（如路线语义、风险预测），实现基于语言的注视行为描述。

Result: 微调模型在注意力转移检测和可解释性上优于通用视觉-语言模型，支持少样本和单样本学习。

Conclusion: 该框架为自动驾驶中的可解释AI提供了新方向，支持行为预测、人机协作等下游任务。

Abstract: Driver visual attention prediction is a critical task in autonomous driving
and human-computer interaction (HCI) research. Most prior studies focus on
estimating attention allocation at a single moment in time, typically using
static RGB images such as driving scene pictures. In this work, we propose a
vision-language framework that models the changing landscape of drivers' gaze
through natural language, using few-shot and zero-shot learning on single RGB
images. We curate and refine high-quality captions from the BDD-A dataset using
human-in-the-loop feedback, then fine-tune LLaVA to align visual perception
with attention-centric scene understanding. Our approach integrates both
low-level cues and top-down context (e.g., route semantics, risk anticipation),
enabling language-based descriptions of gaze behavior. We evaluate performance
across training regimes (few shot, and one-shot) and introduce domain-specific
metrics for semantic alignment and response diversity. Results show that our
fine-tuned model outperforms general-purpose VLMs in attention shift detection
and interpretability. To our knowledge, this is among the first attempts to
generate driver visual attention allocation and shifting predictions in natural
language, offering a new direction for explainable AI in autonomous driving.
Our approach provides a foundation for downstream tasks such as behavior
forecasting, human-AI teaming, and multi-agent coordination.

### [14] [Multi-view Gaze Target Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05857)
*Qiaomu Miao,Vivek Raju Golani,Jingyi Xu,Progga Paromita Dutta,Minh Hoai,Dimitris Samaras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用多摄像头视角进行视线目标估计（GTE）的方法，通过整合不同视角的信息提高准确性，解决了单视角方法中的人脸遮挡、目标模糊和视野外目标等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单视角GTE方法在人脸遮挡、目标模糊和视野外目标等情况下表现不佳，多视角方法可以弥补这些不足。

Method: 方法包括头部信息聚合（HIA）模块、基于不确定性的视线选择（UGS）模块和基于极线的场景注意力（ESA）模块，输入为一对摄像头视角。

Result: 该方法显著优于单视角基线，尤其在第二摄像头能清晰捕捉人脸时表现更佳，且具备仅通过第二视角图像估计第一视角视线目标的能力。

Conclusion: 多视角方法在GTE任务中具有显著优势，同时提供了多视角数据集以支持未来研究。

Abstract: This paper presents a method that utilizes multiple camera views for the gaze
target estimation (GTE) task. The approach integrates information from
different camera views to improve accuracy and expand applicability, addressing
limitations in existing single-view methods that face challenges such as face
occlusion, target ambiguity, and out-of-view targets. Our method processes a
pair of camera views as input, incorporating a Head Information Aggregation
(HIA) module for leveraging head information from both views for more accurate
gaze estimation, an Uncertainty-based Gaze Selection (UGS) for identifying the
most reliable gaze output, and an Epipolar-based Scene Attention (ESA) module
for cross-view background information sharing. This approach significantly
outperforms single-view baselines, especially when the second camera provides a
clear view of the person's face. Additionally, our method can estimate the gaze
target in the first view using the image of the person in the second view only,
a capability not possessed by single-view GTE methods. Furthermore, the paper
introduces a multi-view dataset for developing and evaluating multi-view GTE
methods. Data and code are available at

Motivation: 预训练视觉语言模型（VLMs）在零样本任务中表现良好，但在分布偏移下泛化能力不足。现有基于缓存的TTA方法仅存储高置信度样本，限制了决策边界的优化。

Method: ETTA引入递归更新模块，动态整合所有测试样本以优化决策边界，并结合自适应集成模块动态选择最优提示。

Result: 实验表明，ETTA在计算复杂度和准确性上均优于现有TTA方法。

Conclusion: ETTA为高效、有效的测试时适应设定了新标准，代码已开源。

Abstract: Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP show strong zero-shot
performance but struggle with generalization under distribution shifts.
Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses this by adapting VLMs to unlabeled test
data in new domains. While some TTA methods rely on prompt-tuning,
training-free cache-based approaches are preferred for efficiency. However,
current cache-based TTA models store only a limited set of high-confidence
samples, restricting the decision boundary to these samples and ignoring the
influence of other incoming test data. To address this, we propose Efficient
Test-Time Adaptation (ETTA), introducing a Recursive Updating module that
integrates all incoming test samples, progressively refining the decision
boundary. This strategy mimics an unbounded cache, dynamically updating
contextual embeddings for improved accuracy with minimal memory and
computational overhead. ETTA also includes an Adaptive Ensemble module to
reduce prompt dependency in image-to-text scores by dynamically selecting
optimal prompts for each class. Furthermore, ETTA adaptively combines scores
from both modules based on confidence levels, leveraging their complementary
strengths. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks confirm that ETTA surpasses
the state-of-the-art TTA models in computational complexity and accuracy,
setting a new standard for effective, efficient test-time adaptation. The code
has been released at https://github.com/hamidreza-dastmalchi/ETTA.

*Lang Nie,Yuan Mei,Kang Liao,Yunqiu Xu,Chunyu Lin,Bin Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RopStitch是一种无监督深度图像拼接框架，通过双分支架构和虚拟最优平面概念提升鲁棒性和自然性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图像拼接中内容对齐与结构保留的矛盾，并提升模型在多样化场景中的泛化能力。

Method: 采用双分支架构（预训练分支和可学习分支）捕获特征，提出虚拟最优平面概念并通过迭代系数预测器优化拼接平面。

Result: 在多个数据集上显著优于现有方法，尤其在场景鲁棒性和内容自然性方面表现突出。

Conclusion: RopStitch通过创新的双分支架构和虚拟最优平面设计，实现了高效且自然的图像拼接。

Abstract: We present \textit{RopStitch}, an unsupervised deep image stitching framework
with both robustness and naturalness. To ensure the robustness of
\textit{RopStitch}, we propose to incorporate the universal prior of content
perception into the image stitching model by a dual-branch architecture. It
separately captures coarse and fine features and integrates them to achieve
highly generalizable performance across diverse unseen real-world scenes.
Concretely, the dual-branch model consists of a pretrained branch to capture
semantically invariant representations and a learnable branch to extract
fine-grained discriminative features, which are then merged into a whole by a
controllable factor at the correlation level. Besides, considering that content
alignment and structural preservation are often contradictory to each other, we
propose a concept of virtual optimal planes to relieve this conflict. To this
end, we model this problem as a process of estimating homography decomposition
coefficients, and design an iterative coefficient predictor and minimal
semantic distortion constraint to identify the optimal plane. This scheme is
finally incorporated into \textit{RopStitch} by warping both views onto the
optimal plane bidirectionally. Extensive experiments across various datasets
demonstrate that \textit{RopStitch} significantly outperforms existing methods,
particularly in scene robustness and content naturalness. The code is available
at {\color{red}https://github.com/MmelodYy/RopStitch}.

Conclusion: 神经场模型为移动计算成像提供了一种高效且无需复杂先验的解决方案。

Abstract: Over the past two decades, mobile imaging has experienced a profound
transformation, with cell phones rapidly eclipsing all other forms of digital
photography in popularity. Today's cell phones are equipped with a diverse
range of imaging technologies - laser depth ranging, multi-focal camera arrays,
and split-pixel sensors - alongside non-visual sensors such as gyroscopes,
accelerometers, and magnetometers. This, combined with on-board integrated
chips for image and signal processing, makes the cell phone a versatile
pocket-sized computational imaging platform. Parallel to this, we have seen in
recent years how neural fields - small neural networks trained to map
continuous spatial input coordinates to output signals - enable the
reconstruction of complex scenes without explicit data representations such as
pixel arrays or point clouds. In this thesis, I demonstrate how carefully
designed neural field models can compactly represent complex geometry and
lighting effects. Enabling applications such as depth estimation, layer
separation, and image stitching directly from collected in-the-wild mobile
photography data. These methods outperform state-of-the-art approaches without
relying on complex pre-processing steps, labeled ground truth data, or machine
learning priors. Instead, they leverage well-constructed, self-regularized
models that tackle challenging inverse problems through stochastic gradient
descent, fitting directly to raw measurements from a smartphone.

Abstract: Monitoring construction progress is crucial yet resource-intensive, prompting
the exploration of computer-vision-based methodologies for enhanced efficiency
and scalability. Traditional data acquisition methods, primarily focusing on
indoor environments, falter in construction site's complex, cluttered, and
dynamically changing conditions. This paper critically evaluates the
application of two advanced 3D segmentation methods, Segment Anything Model
(SAM) and Mask3D, in challenging outdoor and indoor conditions. Trained
initially on indoor datasets, both models' adaptability and performance are
assessed in real-world construction settings, highlighting the gap in current
segmentation approaches due to the absence of benchmarks for outdoor scenarios.
Through a comparative analysis, this study not only showcases the relative
effectiveness of SAM and Mask3D but also addresses the critical need for
tailored segmentation workflows capable of extracting actionable insights from
construction site data, thereby advancing the field towards more automated and
precise monitoring techniques.

Conclusion: SINGAD通过几何误差的直接优化和自监督学习，显著提升了单图像法线估计的准确性和一致性。

Abstract: The lack of spatial dimensional information remains a challenge in normal
estimation from a single image. Recent diffusion-based methods have
demonstrated significant potential in 2D-to-3D implicit mapping, they rely on
data-driven statistical priors and miss the explicit modeling of light-surface
interaction, leading to multi-view normal direction conflicts. Moreover, the
discrete sampling mechanism of diffusion models causes gradient discontinuity
in differentiable rendering reconstruction modules, preventing 3D geometric
errors from being backpropagated to the normal generation network, thereby
forcing existing methods to depend on dense normal annotations. This paper
proposes SINGAD, a novel Self-supervised framework from a single Image for
Normal estimation via 3D GAussian splatting guided Diffusion. By integrating
physics-driven light-interaction modeling and a differentiable rendering-based
reprojection strategy, our framework directly converts 3D geometric errors into
normal optimization signals, solving the challenges of multi-view geometric
inconsistency and data dependency. Specifically, the framework constructs a
light-interaction-driven 3DGS reparameterization model to generate multi-scale
geometric features consistent with light transport principles, ensuring
multi-view normal consistency. A cross-domain feature fusion module is designed
within a conditional diffusion model, embedding geometric priors to constrain
normal generation while maintaining accurate geometric error propagation.
Furthermore, a differentiable 3D reprojection loss strategy is introduced for
self-supervised optimization that minimizes geometric error between the
reconstructed and input image, eliminating dependence on annotated normal
datasets. Quantitative evaluations on the Google Scanned Objects dataset
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across
multiple metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在训练成本高且未充分利用预训练LLMs的图像表示能力，因此需要一种更高效的集成方案。

Method: 使用patch级CLIP图像嵌入作为潜在变量，通过轻量级ControlNet适配扩散模型，并初始化MLLM的视觉生成分支。

Result: Bifrost-1在视觉保真度和多模态理解上表现优异，且训练计算成本显著降低。

Conclusion: 该框架成功实现了高效可控的图像生成，同时保留了多模态LLMs的推理能力。

Abstract: There is growing interest in integrating high-fidelity visual synthesis
capabilities into large language models (LLMs) without compromising their
strong reasoning capabilities. Existing methods that directly train LLMs or
bridge LLMs and diffusion models usually suffer from costly training since the
backbone LLMs have not seen image representations during pretraining. We
present Bifrost-1, a unified framework that bridges pretrained multimodal LLMs
(MLLMs) and diffusion models using patch-level CLIP image embeddings as latent
variables, which are natively aligned with the MLLM's CLIP visual encoder.
These patch-level image embeddings are integrated into the diffusion model with
a lightweight adaptation of its ControlNet. To retain the original multimodal
reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, we equip the MLLM with a visual generation
branch initialized from the original MLLM parameters when predicting the
patch-level image embeddings. By seamlessly integrating pretrained MLLMs and
diffusion models with patch-level CLIP latents, our framework enables
high-fidelity controllable image generation with significant training
efficiency. Our experiments demonstrate that Bifrost-1 achieves comparable or
better performance than previous methods in terms of visual fidelity and
multimodal understanding, with substantially lower compute during training. We
also provide comprehensive ablation studies showing the effectiveness of our
design choices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人操作中高级任务语义与低级几何特征之间的割裂问题，以及现有视觉语言模型缺乏语义基础和依赖人工标注的局限性。

Method: 提出PASG框架，包括自动几何基元提取、VLM驱动的语义锚定，以及空间语义推理基准和微调VLM。

Result: 在多样化机器人操作任务中表现优异，性能接近人工标注水平。

Conclusion: PASG实现了更细粒度的语义-功能理解，为机器人操作中的几何基元与任务语义提供了统一范式。

Abstract: The fragmentation between high-level task semantics and low-level geometric
features remains a persistent challenge in robotic manipulation. While
vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise in generating affordance-aware
visual representations, the lack of semantic grounding in canonical spaces and
reliance on manual annotations severely limit their ability to capture dynamic
semantic-affordance relationships. To address these, we propose Primitive-Aware
Semantic Grounding (PASG), a closed-loop framework that introduces: (1)
Automatic primitive extraction through geometric feature aggregation, enabling
cross-category detection of keypoints and axes; (2) VLM-driven semantic
anchoring that dynamically couples geometric primitives with functional
affordances and task-relevant description; (3) A spatial-semantic reasoning
benchmark and a fine-tuned VLM (Qwen2.5VL-PA). We demonstrate PASG's
effectiveness in practical robotic manipulation tasks across diverse scenarios,
achieving performance comparable to manual annotations. PASG achieves a
finer-grained semantic-affordance understanding of objects, establishing a
unified paradigm for bridging geometric primitives with task semantics in
robotic manipulation.

Conclusion: AnimateScene有效解决了3D场景与4D人体动画融合的多个关键问题，实现了高质量的视觉输出。

Abstract: 3D scene reconstruction and 4D human animation have seen rapid progress and
broad adoption in recent years. However, seamlessly integrating reconstructed
scenes with 4D human animation to produce visually engaging results remains
challenging. One key difficulty lies in placing the human at the correct
location and scale within the scene while avoiding unrealistic
interpenetration. Another challenge is that the human and the background may
exhibit different lighting and style, leading to unrealistic composites. In
addition, appealing character motion videos are often accompanied by camera
movements, which means that the viewpoints need to be reconstructed along a
specified trajectory. We present AnimateScene, which addresses the above issues
in a unified framework. First, we design an accurate placement module that
automatically determines a plausible 3D position for the human and prevents any
interpenetration within the scene during motion. Second, we propose a
training-free style alignment method that adapts the 4D human representation to
match the background's lighting and style, achieving coherent visual
integration. Finally, we design a joint post-reconstruction method for both the
4D human and the 3D scene that allows camera trajectories to be inserted,
enabling the final rendered video to feature visually appealing camera
movements. Extensive experiments show that AnimateScene generates dynamic scene
videos with high geometric detail and spatiotemporal coherence across various
camera and action combinations.

Motivation: 深度补全模型在源数据上训练后，在目标数据上因协变量偏移导致预测错误。需要一种无需预知目标分布的方法来适应新环境。

Result: 在三个室内和三个室外数据集上，ETA平均分别提升了10.23%和6.94%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ETA通过能量模型有效适应测试时数据分布，显著提升了深度补全模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: We propose a method for test-time adaptation of pretrained depth completion
models. Depth completion models, trained on some ``source'' data, often predict
erroneous outputs when transferred to ``target'' data captured in novel
environmental conditions due to a covariate shift. The crux of our method lies
in quantifying the likelihood of depth predictions belonging to the source data
distribution. The challenge is in the lack of access to out-of-distribution
(target) data prior to deployment. Hence, rather than making assumptions
regarding the target distribution, we utilize adversarial perturbations as a
mechanism to explore the data space. This enables us to train an energy model
that scores local regions of depth predictions as in- or out-of-distribution.
We update the parameters of pretrained depth completion models at test time to
minimize energy, effectively aligning test-time predictions to those of the
source distribution. We call our method ``Energy-based Test-time Adaptation'',
or ETA for short. We evaluate our method across three indoor and three outdoor
datasets, where ETA improve over the previous state-of-the-art method by an
average of 6.94% for outdoors and 10.23% for indoors. Project Page:

Result: 在多个视频计算机视觉任务中，该方法实现了显著加速，同时性能损失较小。

Conclusion: 所提系统通过优化前端计算和运动估计，显著提升了视频计算机视觉的效率。

Abstract: The efficiency of video computer vision system remains a challenging task due
to the high temporal redundancy inside a video. Existing works have been
proposed for efficient vision computer vision. However, they do not fully
reduce the temporal redundancy and neglect the front end computation overhead.
In this paper, we propose an efficient video computer vision system. First,
image signal processor is removed and Bayer-format data is directly fed into
video computer vision models, thus saving the front end computation. Second,
instead of optical flow models and video codecs, a fast block matching-based
motion estimation algorithm is proposed specifically for efficient video
computer vision, with a MV refinement module. To correct the error,
context-aware block refinement network is introduced to refine regions with
large error. To further balance the accuracy and efficiency, a frame selection
strategy is employed. Experiments on multiple video computer vision tasks
demonstrate that our method achieves significant acceleration with slight
performance loss.

Abstract: Emotion recognition plays a vital role in enhancing human-computer
interaction. In this study, we tackle the MER-SEMI challenge of the MER2025
competition by proposing a novel multimodal emotion recognition framework. To
address the issue of data scarcity, we leverage large-scale pre-trained models
to extract informative features from visual, audio, and textual modalities.
Specifically, for the visual modality, we design a dual-branch visual encoder
that captures both global frame-level features and localized facial
representations. For the textual modality, we introduce a context-enriched
method that employs large language models to enrich emotional cues within the
input text. To effectively integrate these multimodal features, we propose a
fusion strategy comprising two key components, i.e., self-attention mechanisms
for dynamic modality weighting, and residual connections to preserve original
representations. Beyond architectural design, we further refine noisy labels in
the training set by a multi-source labeling strategy. Our approach achieves a
substantial performance improvement over the official baseline on the
MER2025-SEMI dataset, attaining a weighted F-score of 87.49% compared to
78.63%, thereby validating the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因缺乏结构化配对数据，导致化妆细节粗糙且难以平衡身份和化妆保真度。

Method: 引入MakeupQuad数据集，提出EvoMakeup框架，通过多阶段蒸馏避免图像退化，支持迭代优化。

Result: EvoMakeup在真实场景中表现优异，支持全脸、局部和文本驱动的化妆编辑，平衡保真度和身份保留。

Conclusion: EvoMakeup在化妆编辑任务中表现卓越，数据集和代码将公开。

Abstract: Facial makeup editing aims to realistically transfer makeup from a reference
to a target face. Existing methods often produce low-quality results with
coarse makeup details and struggle to preserve both identity and makeup
fidelity, mainly due to the lack of structured paired data -- where source and
result share identity, and reference and result share identical makeup. To
address this, we introduce MakeupQuad, a large-scale, high-quality dataset with
non-makeup faces, references, edited results, and textual makeup descriptions.
Building on this, we propose EvoMakeup, a unified training framework that
mitigates image degradation during multi-stage distillation, enabling iterative
improvement of both data and model quality. Although trained solely on
synthetic data, EvoMakeup generalizes well and outperforms prior methods on
real-world benchmarks. It supports high-fidelity, controllable, multi-task
makeup editing -- including full-face and partial reference-based editing, as
well as text-driven makeup editing -- within a single model. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method achieves superior makeup fidelity and
identity preservation, effectively balancing both aspects. Code and dataset
will be released upon acceptance.

Conclusion: MathReal为MLLMs在真实教育场景中的改进提供了方向，未来需优化模型以适应复杂输入。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in visual mathematical reasoning across various existing
benchmarks. However, these benchmarks are predominantly based on clean or
processed multimodal inputs, without incorporating the images provided by
real-world Kindergarten through 12th grade (K-12) educational users. To address
this gap, we introduce MathReal, a meticulously curated dataset comprising
2,000 mathematical questions with images captured by handheld mobile devices in
authentic scenarios. Each question is an image, containing the question text
and visual element. We systematically classify the real images into three
primary categories: image quality degradation, perspective variation, and
irrelevant content interference, which are further delineated into 14
subcategories. Additionally, MathReal spans five core knowledge and ability
categories, which encompass three question types and are divided into three
difficulty levels. To comprehensively evaluate the multimodal mathematical
reasoning abilities of state-of-the-art MLLMs in real-world scenarios, we
design six experimental settings that enable a systematic analysis of their
performance. Through extensive experimentation, we find that the
problem-solving abilities of existing MLLMs are significantly challenged in
realistic educational contexts. Based on this, we conduct a thorough analysis
of their performance and error patterns, providing insights into their
recognition, comprehension, and reasoning capabilities, and outlining
directions for future improvements. Data and code:

Abstract: Recent advances in novel view synthesis (NVS) have enabled real-time
rendering with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). However, existing methods struggle
with artifacts and missing regions when rendering from viewpoints that deviate
from the training trajectory, limiting seamless scene exploration. To address
this, we propose a 3DGS-based pipeline that generates additional training views
to enhance reconstruction. We introduce an information-gain-driven virtual
camera placement strategy to maximize scene coverage, followed by video
diffusion priors to refine rendered results. Fine-tuning 3D Gaussians with
these enhanced views significantly improves reconstruction quality. To evaluate
our method, we present Wild-Explore, a benchmark designed for challenging scene
exploration. Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing
3DGS-based methods, enabling high-quality, artifact-free rendering from
arbitrary viewpoints.

Abstract: Sub-visible particle analysis using flow imaging microscopy combined with
deep learning has proven effective in identifying particle types, enabling the
distinction of harmless components such as silicone oil from protein particles.
However, the scarcity of available data and severe imbalance between particle
types within datasets remain substantial hurdles when applying multi-class
classifiers to such problems, often forcing researchers to rely on less
effective methods. The aforementioned issue is particularly challenging for
particle types that appear unintentionally and in lower numbers, such as
silicone oil and air bubbles, as opposed to protein particles, where obtaining
large numbers of images through controlled settings is comparatively
straightforward. In this work, we develop a state-of-the-art diffusion model to
address data imbalance by generating high-fidelity images that can augment
training datasets, enabling the effective training of multi-class deep neural
networks. We validate this approach by demonstrating that the generated samples
closely resemble real particle images in terms of visual quality and structure.
To assess the effectiveness of using diffusion-generated images in training
datasets, we conduct large-scale experiments on a validation dataset comprising
500,000 protein particle images and demonstrate that this approach improves
classification performance with no negligible downside. Finally, to promote
open research and reproducibility, we publicly release both our diffusion
models and the trained multi-class deep neural network classifiers, along with
a straightforward interface for easy integration into future studies, at

### [30] [Learning 3D Texture-Aware Representations for Parsing Diverse Human Clothing and Body Parts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06032)
*Kiran Chhatre,Christopher Peters,Srikrishna Karanam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Spectrum提出了一种统一网络，用于像素级解析（身体部位和衣物）和实例级分组，通过改进的图像到纹理扩散模型实现更精细的衣物和身体部位分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用固定掩码类别，无法区分细粒度衣物类型；开放词汇分割方法将整个人体归为单一类别，忽略了衣物多样性。

Method: 利用图像到纹理（I2Tx）扩散模型提取特征，通过提示引导生成语义有效的掩码。

Result: 在跨数据集实验中，Spectrum在提示分割任务中表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Spectrum通过改进的扩散模型实现了更精细的人体解析，适用于多样化的衣物和身体部位分割。

Abstract: Existing methods for human parsing into body parts and clothing often use
fixed mask categories with broad labels that obscure fine-grained clothing
types. Recent open-vocabulary segmentation approaches leverage pretrained
text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model features for strong zero-shot transfer, but
typically group entire humans into a single person category, failing to
distinguish diverse clothing or detailed body parts. To address this, we
propose Spectrum, a unified network for part-level pixel parsing (body parts
and clothing) and instance-level grouping. While diffusion-based
open-vocabulary models generalize well across tasks, their internal
representations are not specialized for detailed human parsing. We observe
that, unlike diffusion models with broad representations, image-driven 3D
texture generators maintain faithful correspondence to input images, enabling
stronger representations for parsing diverse clothing and body parts. Spectrum
introduces a novel repurposing of an Image-to-Texture (I2Tx) diffusion model --
obtained by fine-tuning a T2I model on 3D human texture maps -- for improved
alignment with body parts and clothing. From an input image, we extract
human-part internal features via the I2Tx diffusion model and generate
semantically valid masks aligned to diverse clothing categories through
prompt-guided grounding. Once trained, Spectrum produces semantic segmentation
maps for every visible body part and clothing category, ignoring standalone
garments or irrelevant objects, for any number of humans in the scene. We
conduct extensive cross-dataset experiments -- separately assessing body parts,
clothing parts, unseen clothing categories, and full-body masks -- and
demonstrate that Spectrum consistently outperforms baseline methods in
prompt-based segmentation.

TL;DR: InstantEdit是一种基于RectifiedFlow框架的快速文本引导图像编辑方法，通过PerRFI反转策略和Inversion Latent Injection技术实现高效编辑，同时结合Disentangled Prompt Guidance和Canny-conditioned ControlNet提升效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本引导图像编辑方法在速度和编辑效果上存在不足，InstantEdit旨在通过RectifiedFlow框架和新技术实现快速且高质量的编辑。

Method: 采用RectifiedFlow框架，引入PerRFI反转策略和Inversion Latent Injection技术，结合Disentangled Prompt Guidance和Canny-conditioned ControlNet。

Result: 在PIE数据集上，InstantEdit在速度和编辑质量上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: InstantEdit是一种高效且高质量的文本引导图像编辑方法，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: We propose a fast text-guided image editing method called InstantEdit based
on the RectifiedFlow framework, which is structured as a few-step editing
process that preserves critical content while following closely to textual
instructions. Our approach leverages the straight sampling trajectories of
RectifiedFlow by introducing a specialized inversion strategy called PerRFI. To
maintain consistent while editable results for RectifiedFlow model, we further
propose a novel regeneration method, Inversion Latent Injection, which
effectively reuses latent information obtained during inversion to facilitate
more coherent and detailed regeneration. Additionally, we propose a
Disentangled Prompt Guidance technique to balance editability with detail
preservation, and integrate a Canny-conditioned ControlNet to incorporate
structural cues and suppress artifacts. Evaluation on the PIE image editing
dataset demonstrates that InstantEdit is not only fast but also achieves better
qualitative and quantitative results compared to state-of-the-art few-step
editing methods.

Motivation: 解决半监督学习中的情感识别问题，利用多模态数据和未标记数据提升模型性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过多模态和伪标签策略有效提升了半监督情感识别的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we present our solution for the semi-supervised learning track
(MER-SEMI) in MER2025. We propose a comprehensive framework, grounded in the
principle that "more is better," to construct a robust Mixture of Experts (MoE)
emotion recognition system. Our approach integrates a diverse range of input
modalities as independent experts, including novel signals such as knowledge
from large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and temporal Action Unit (AU)
information. To effectively utilize unlabeled data, we introduce a
consensus-based pseudo-labeling strategy, generating high-quality labels from
the agreement between a baseline model and Gemini, which are then used in a
two-stage training paradigm. Finally, we employ a multi-expert voting ensemble
combined with a rule-based re-ranking process to correct prediction bias and
better align the outputs with human preferences. Evaluated on the MER2025-SEMI
challenge dataset, our method achieves an F1-score of 0.8772 on the test set,
ranking 2nd in the track. Our code is available at

*Huanyu Wang,Jushi Kai,Haoli Bai,Lu Hou,Bo Jiang,Ziwei He,Zhouhan Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fourier-VLM通过频域压缩视觉表示，显著减少计算开销和推理延迟，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型中大量视觉标记增加了上下文长度，导致高计算开销和推理延迟。

Method: 使用二维离散余弦变换（DCT）对视觉特征进行低通滤波，利用FFT高效计算。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，推理FLOPs减少83.8%，生成速度提升31.2%。

Conclusion: Fourier-VLM在高效性和实用性上表现突出，适用于多种架构。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) typically replace the predefined image
placeholder token (<image>) in textual instructions with visual features from
an image encoder, forming the input to a backbone Large Language Model (LLM).
However, the large number of vision tokens significantly increases the context
length, leading to high computational overhead and inference latency. While
previous efforts mitigate this by selecting only important visual features or
leveraging learnable queries to reduce token count, they often compromise
performance or introduce substantial extra costs. In response, we propose
Fourier-VLM, a simple yet efficient method that compresses visual
representations in the frequency domain. Our approach is motivated by the
observation that vision features output from the vision encoder exhibit
concentrated energy in low-frequency components. Leveraging this, we apply a
low-pass filter to the vision features using a two-dimentional Discrete Cosine
Transform (DCT). Notably, the DCT is efficiently computed via the Fast Fourier
Transform (FFT) operator with a time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$,
minimizing the extra computational cost while introducing no additional
parameters. Extensive experiments across various image-based benchmarks
demonstrate that Fourier-VLM achieves competitive performance with strong
generalizability across both LLaVA and Qwen-VL architectures. Crucially, it
reduce inference FLOPs by up to 83.8% and boots generation speed by 31.2%
compared to LLaVA-v1.5, highlighting the superior efficiency and practicality.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于自回归图像生成的Next Editing-token Prediction（NEP）方法，仅重新生成需要编辑的区域，避免了对非编辑区域的不必要修改，从而提高了编辑质量和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本引导图像编辑方法会生成整个目标图像，导致计算成本高且非编辑区域的重建偏差影响编辑质量。

Method: 通过预训练任意顺序自回归文本到图像（T2I）模型，实现零样本图像编辑，并适应NEP方法。

Result: 在广泛使用的图像编辑基准测试中达到新的最优性能，并支持零样本迭代优化的测试时缩放（TTS）。

Conclusion: NEP方法显著提升了图像编辑的效率和效果，为文本引导图像编辑提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-guided image editing involves modifying a source image based on a
language instruction and, typically, requires changes to only small local
regions. However, existing approaches generate the entire target image rather
than selectively regenerate only the intended editing areas. This results in
(1) unnecessary computational costs and (2) a bias toward reconstructing
non-editing regions, which compromises the quality of the intended edits. To
resolve these limitations, we propose to formulate image editing as Next
Editing-token Prediction (NEP) based on autoregressive image generation, where
only regions that need to be edited are regenerated, thus avoiding unintended
modification to the non-editing areas. To enable any-region editing, we propose
to pre-train an any-order autoregressive text-to-image (T2I) model. Once
trained, it is capable of zero-shot image editing and can be easily adapted to
NEP for image editing, which achieves a new state-of-the-art on widely used
image editing benchmarks. Moreover, our model naturally supports test-time
scaling (TTS) through iteratively refining its generation in a zero-shot
manner. The project page is: https://nep-bigai.github.io/

TL;DR: VQAThinker是一个基于推理的视频质量评估框架，利用多模态模型和强化学习解决现有模型的泛化性和可解释性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频质量评估模型在泛化性和可解释性方面存在不足，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 采用GRPO算法和三种奖励机制（回归、排序和时间一致性）来模拟人类感知决策。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，泛化性强，且在质量描述和失真归因方面优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 强化学习为构建仅需分数监督的泛化性和可解释性VQA模型提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) aims to objectively quantify perceptual
quality degradation in alignment with human visual perception. Despite recent
advances, existing VQA models still suffer from two critical limitations:
\textit{poor generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) videos} and
\textit{limited explainability}, which restrict their applicability in
real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose
\textbf{VQAThinker}, a reasoning-based VQA framework that leverages large
multimodal models (LMMs) with reinforcement learning to jointly model video
quality understanding and scoring, emulating human perceptual decision-making.
Specifically, we adopt group relative policy optimization (GRPO), a rule-guided
reinforcement learning algorithm that enables reasoning over video quality
under score-level supervision, and introduce three VQA-specific rewards: (1) a
\textbf{bell-shaped regression reward} that increases rapidly as the prediction
error decreases and becomes progressively less sensitive near the ground truth;
(2) a \textbf{pairwise ranking reward} that guides the model to correctly
determine the relative quality between video pairs; and (3) a \textbf{temporal
consistency reward} that encourages the model to prefer temporally coherent
videos over their perturbed counterparts. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that VQAThinker achieves state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and OOD
VQA benchmarks, showing strong generalization for video quality scoring.
Furthermore, evaluations on video quality understanding tasks validate its
superiority in distortion attribution and quality description compared to
existing explainable VQA models and LMMs. These findings demonstrate that
reinforcement learning offers an effective pathway toward building
generalizable and explainable VQA models solely with score-level supervision.

Conclusion: 需要更全面的基准来推动地球观测数据在AGI中的应用。

Abstract: Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is closer than ever to becoming a
reality, sparking widespread enthusiasm in the research community to collect
and work with various modalities, including text, image, video, and audio.
Despite recent efforts, satellite spectral imagery, as an additional modality,
has yet to receive the attention it deserves. This area presents unique
challenges, but also holds great promise in advancing the capabilities of AGI
in understanding the natural world. In this paper, we argue why Earth
Observation data is useful for an intelligent model, and then we review
existing benchmarks and highlight their limitations in evaluating the
generalization ability of foundation models in this domain. This paper
emphasizes the need for a more comprehensive benchmark to evaluate earth
observation models. To facilitate this, we propose a comprehensive set of tasks
that a benchmark should encompass to effectively assess a model's ability to
understand and interact with Earth observation data.

TL;DR: TSANet是一种轻量级的两阶段网络，通过状态空间增强的交叉注意力，分别处理事件像素修复和去马赛克，显著提升了HybridEVS相机的图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HybridEVS相机结合Quad Bayer CFA传感器和事件像素时，由于事件像素缺乏颜色信息，导致去马赛克过程中出现伪影和混叠问题，现有方法难以在资源有限的移动设备上解决这些问题。

Method: 提出TSANet，采用两阶段网络设计，分别处理事件像素修复和去马赛克，并引入轻量级的Cross-Swin State Block，利用位置先验和状态空间模型增强全局依赖关系。

Result: 在模拟和真实HybridEVS数据上，TSANet在PSNR和SSIM指标上优于现有方法DemosaicFormer，同时参数和计算成本分别降低1.86倍和3.29倍。

Conclusion: TSANet为移动设备上的高效图像去马赛克提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Event cameras like the Hybrid Event-based Vision Sensor (HybridEVS) camera
capture brightness changes as asynchronous "events" instead of frames, offering
advanced application on mobile photography. However, challenges arise from
combining a Quad Bayer Color Filter Array (CFA) sensor with event pixels
lacking color information, resulting in aliasing and artifacts on the
demosaicing process before downstream application. Current methods struggle to
address these issues, especially on resource-limited mobile devices. In
response, we introduce \textbf{TSANet}, a lightweight \textbf{T}wo-stage
network via \textbf{S}tate space augmented cross-\textbf{A}ttention, which can
handle event pixels inpainting and demosaicing separately, leveraging the
benefits of dividing complex tasks into manageable subtasks. Furthermore, we
introduce a lightweight Cross-Swin State Block that uniquely utilizes
positional prior for demosaicing and enhances global dependencies through the
state space model with linear complexity. In summary, TSANet demonstrates
excellent demosaicing performance on both simulated and real data of HybridEVS
while maintaining a lightweight model, averaging better results than the
previous state-of-the-art method DemosaicFormer across seven diverse datasets
in both PSNR and SSIM, while respectively reducing parameter and computation
costs by $1.86\times$ and $3.29\times$. Our approach presents new possibilities
for efficient image demosaicing on mobile devices. Code is available in the
supplementary materials.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管SOD和COD任务具有矛盾属性，但作者认为通过正确的学习方法，网络可以同时具备检测显著和伪装目标的能力，从而让两个任务受益。

Method: 提出SCJoint方法，通过插入少量任务特定参数学习解码过程的分布特征，分离任务矛盾属性；同时提出SBSS策略平衡训练集并优化质量。

Result: 实验表明，所提出的JoNet网络在SOD和COD任务上均表现出色，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过SCJoint和SBSS，成功实现了SOD和COD任务的联合学习，网络性能得到提升。

Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD) and camouflaged object detection (COD) are two
closely related but distinct computer vision tasks. Although both are
class-agnostic segmentation tasks that map from RGB space to binary space, the
former aims to identify the most salient objects in the image, while the latter
focuses on detecting perfectly camouflaged objects that blend into the
background in the image. These two tasks exhibit strong contradictory
attributes. Previous works have mostly believed that joint learning of these
two tasks would confuse the network, reducing its performance on both tasks.
However, here we present an opposite perspective: with the correct approach to
learning, the network can simultaneously possess the capability to find both
salient and camouflaged objects, allowing both tasks to benefit from joint
learning. We propose SCJoint, a joint learning scheme for SOD and COD tasks,
assuming that the decoding processes of SOD and COD have different distribution
characteristics. The key to our method is to learn the respective means and
variances of the decoding processes for both tasks by inserting a minimal
amount of task-specific learnable parameters within a fully shared network
structure, thereby decoupling the contradictory attributes of the two tasks at
a minimal cost. Furthermore, we propose a saliency-based sampling strategy
(SBSS) to sample the training set of the SOD task to balance the training set
sizes of the two tasks. In addition, SBSS improves the training set quality and
shortens the training time. Based on the proposed SCJoint and SBSS, we train a
powerful generalist network, named JoNet, which has the ability to
simultaneously capture both ``salient" and ``camouflaged". Extensive
experiments demonstrate the competitive performance and effectiveness of our
proposed method. The code is available at https://github.com/linuxsino/JoNet.

Method: 采用成对比较评估，收集了超过 45k 票，评估了 53 个主流模型在 90 种生物运动变体上的表现。

Result: 数据显示众包投票与专家评分一致，且超过 90% 的模型无法生成基本的人形点光源组。

Conclusion: BioMotion Arena 是一个具有挑战性的性能可视化基准测试框架。

Abstract: Evaluating the abilities of large models and manifesting their gaps are
challenging. Current benchmarks adopt either ground-truth-based score-form
evaluation on static datasets or indistinct textual chatbot-style human
preferences collection, which may not provide users with immediate, intuitive,
and perceptible feedback on performance differences. In this paper, we
introduce BioMotion Arena, a novel framework for evaluating large language
models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) via visual
animation. Our methodology draws inspiration from the inherent visual
perception of motion patterns characteristic of living organisms that utilizes
point-light source imaging to amplify the performance discrepancies between
models. Specifically, we employ a pairwise comparison evaluation and collect
more than 45k votes for 53 mainstream LLMs and MLLMs on 90 biological motion
variants. Data analyses show that the crowd-sourced human votes are in good
agreement with those of expert raters, demonstrating the superiority of our
BioMotion Arena in offering discriminative feedback. We also find that over
90\% of evaluated models, including the cutting-edge open-source InternVL3 and
proprietary Claude-4 series, fail to produce fundamental humanoid point-light
groups, much less smooth and biologically plausible motions. This enables
BioMotion Arena to serve as a challenging benchmark for performance
visualization and a flexible evaluation framework without restrictions on
ground-truth.

Method: 使用隐式神经表示（INR）生成超分辨率MR体积，多标签网络分割骨骼，小波扩散模型（WDM）生成伪健康目标形态。

Result: 在25名TD患者中验证，显著改善了滑车角度（SA）和滑车沟深度（TGD）。

Conclusion: 该方法无需CT扫描，减少了辐射，并提供了术前和术中兼容的高分辨率3D形态。

Abstract: To treat Trochlear Dysplasia (TD), current approaches rely mainly on
low-resolution clinical Magnetic Resonance (MR) scans and surgical intuition.
The surgeries are planned based on surgeons experience, have limited adoption
of minimally invasive techniques, and lead to inconsistent outcomes. We propose
a pipeline that generates super-resolved, patient-specific 3D pseudo-healthy
target morphologies from conventional clinical MR scans. First, we compute an
isotropic super-resolved MR volume using an Implicit Neural Representation
(INR). Next, we segment femur, tibia, patella, and fibula with a multi-label
custom-trained network. Finally, we train a Wavelet Diffusion Model (WDM) to
generate pseudo-healthy target morphologies of the trochlear region. In
contrast to prior work producing pseudo-healthy low-resolution 3D MR images,
our approach enables the generation of sub-millimeter resolved 3D shapes
compatible for pre- and intraoperative use. These can serve as preoperative
blueprints for reshaping the femoral groove while preserving the native patella
articulation. Furthermore, and in contrast to other work, we do not require a
CT for our pipeline - reducing the amount of radiation. We evaluated our
approach on 25 TD patients and could show that our target morphologies
significantly improve the sulcus angle (SA) and trochlear groove depth (TGD).

Conclusion: DreamVE通过统一框架和多样化数据合成，显著提升了指令编辑的实用性和效果。

Abstract: Instruction-based editing holds vast potential due to its simple and
efficient interactive editing format. However, instruction-based editing,
particularly for video, has been constrained by limited training data,
hindering its practical application. To this end, we introduce DreamVE, a
unified model for instruction-based image and video editing. Specifically, We
propose a two-stage training strategy: first image editing, then video editing.
This offers two main benefits: (1) Image data scales more easily, and models
are more efficient to train, providing useful priors for faster and better
video editing training. (2) Unifying image and video generation is natural and
aligns with current trends. Moreover, we present comprehensive training data
synthesis pipelines, including collage-based and generative model-based data
synthesis. The collage-based data synthesis combines foreground objects and
backgrounds to generate diverse editing data, such as object manipulation,
background changes, and text modifications. It can easily generate billions of
accurate, consistent, realistic, and diverse editing pairs. We pretrain DreamVE
on extensive collage-based data to achieve strong performance in key editing
types and enhance generalization and transfer capabilities. However,
collage-based data lacks some attribute editing cases, leading to a relative
drop in performance. In contrast, the generative model-based pipeline, despite
being hard to scale up, offers flexibility in handling attribute editing cases.
Therefore, we use generative model-based data to further fine-tune DreamVE.
Besides, we design an efficient and powerful editing framework for DreamVE. We
build on the SOTA T2V model and use a token concatenation with early drop
approach to inject source image guidance, ensuring strong consistency and
editability. The codes and models will be released.

Motivation: 现有基于扩散或流的视频生成模型需要多次迭代采样，计算开销大；现有蒸馏方法在少步设置下性能下降或产生更多伪影。

Method: 提出SwiftVideo框架，结合轨迹保持和分布匹配策略，包括连续时间一致性蒸馏和双视角对齐（分布对齐和轨迹对齐）。

Result: 在OpenVid-1M基准测试中，SwiftVideo在少步视频生成中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SwiftVideo是一种统一且稳定的蒸馏框架，能高效减少推理步骤并保持生成质量。

Abstract: Diffusion-based or flow-based models have achieved significant progress in
video synthesis but require multiple iterative sampling steps, which incurs
substantial computational overhead. While many distillation methods that are
solely based on trajectory-preserving or distribution-matching have been
developed to accelerate video generation models, these approaches often suffer
from performance breakdown or increased artifacts under few-step settings. To
address these limitations, we propose \textbf{\emph{SwiftVideo}}, a unified and
stable distillation framework that combines the advantages of
trajectory-preserving and distribution-matching strategies. Our approach
introduces continuous-time consistency distillation to ensure precise
preservation of ODE trajectories. Subsequently, we propose a dual-perspective
alignment that includes distribution alignment between synthetic and real data
along with trajectory alignment across different inference steps. Our method
maintains high-quality video generation while substantially reducing the number
of inference steps. Quantitative evaluations on the OpenVid-1M benchmark
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in
few-step video generation.

TL;DR: 提出AdaptInfer框架，动态剪裁视觉令牌以减少推理成本，保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有剪裁方法未能充分利用推理中的动态信号，导致效率不足。

Method: 引入动态文本引导剪裁机制和基于跨模态注意力的剪裁调度策略。

Result: 减少61.3%的CUDA延迟，保持92.9%的准确率，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AdaptInfer高效且通用，显著提升视觉语言模型的推理效率。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance on
multimodal reasoning tasks such as visual question answering (VQA), but their
inference cost remains a significant challenge due to the large number of
vision tokens processed during the prefill stage. Existing pruning methods
often rely on directly using the attention patterns or static text prompt
guidance, failing to exploit the dynamic internal signals generated during
inference. To address these issues, we propose AdaptInfer, a plug-and-play
framework for adaptive vision token pruning in VLMs. First, we introduce a
fine-grained, dynamic text-guided pruning mechanism that reuses layer-wise
text-to-text attention maps to construct soft priors over text-token
importance, allowing more informed scoring of vision tokens at each stage.
Second, we perform an offline analysis of cross-modal attention shifts and
identify consistent inflection locations in inference, which inspire us to
propose a more principled and efficient pruning schedule. Our method is
lightweight and plug-and-play, also generalizable across multi-modal tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Q-CLIP是一种基于视觉语言模型（VLMs）的视频质量评估（VQA）框架，通过共享跨模态适配器（SCMA）和可学习质量提示，显著降低了计算成本并提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VQA方法依赖大规模预训练数据集，计算成本高且语义知识迁移不足，无法全面评估视频质量。

Method: 提出Q-CLIP框架，利用SCMA增强视觉和文本表示，引入可学习质量提示，并研究帧采样策略。

Result: Q-CLIP在多个VQA数据集上表现优异，计算成本显著降低。

Conclusion: Q-CLIP为VQA提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案，展示了VLMs在质量评估中的潜力。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient Video Quality Assessment (VQA) has long been a key
research challenge. Current mainstream VQA methods typically improve
performance by pretraining on large-scale classification datasets (e.g.,
ImageNet, Kinetics-400), followed by fine-tuning on VQA datasets. However, this
strategy presents two significant challenges: (1) merely transferring semantic
knowledge learned from pretraining is insufficient for VQA, as video quality
depends on multiple factors (e.g., semantics, distortion, motion, aesthetics);
(2) pretraining on large-scale datasets demands enormous computational
resources, often dozens or even hundreds of times greater than training
directly on VQA datasets. Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown
remarkable generalization capabilities across a wide range of visual tasks, and
have begun to demonstrate promising potential in quality assessment. In this
work, we propose Q-CLIP, the first fully VLMs-based framework for VQA. Q-CLIP
enhances both visual and textual representations through a Shared Cross-Modal
Adapter (SCMA), which contains only a minimal number of trainable parameters
and is the only component that requires training. This design significantly
reduces computational cost. In addition, we introduce a set of five learnable
quality-level prompts to guide the VLMs in perceiving subtle quality
variations, thereby further enhancing the model's sensitivity to video quality.
Furthermore, we investigate the impact of different frame sampling strategies
on VQA performance, and find that frame-difference-based sampling leads to
better generalization performance across datasets. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Q-CLIP exhibits excellent performance on several VQA datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自监督学习框架，用于手写数学表达式识别（HMER），无需昂贵标注数据，通过对比损失和渐进空间掩码策略训练注意力网络，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手写数学表达式识别因二维结构、符号尺度变化和复杂空间关系而具有挑战性，现有方法依赖大量标注数据，成本高昂。

Method: 结合全局和局部对比损失预训练图像编码器，设计自监督注意力网络，采用渐进空间掩码策略训练，最后通过监督微调生成LATEX序列。

Result: 在CROHME基准测试中，性能优于现有自监督和全监督基线方法。

Conclusion: 渐进注意力机制显著提升HMER性能，自监督框架有效减少对标注数据的依赖。

Abstract: Recognizing handwritten mathematical expressions (HMER) is a challenging task
due to the inherent two-dimensional structure, varying symbol scales, and
complex spatial relationships among symbols. In this paper, we present a
self-supervised learning (SSL) framework for HMER that eliminates the need for
expensive labeled data. Our approach begins by pretraining an image encoder
using a combination of global and local contrastive loss, enabling the model to
learn both holistic and fine-grained representations. A key contribution of
this work is a novel self-supervised attention network, which is trained using
a progressive spatial masking strategy. This attention mechanism is designed to
learn semantically meaningful focus regions, such as operators, exponents, and
nested mathematical notation, without requiring any supervision. The
progressive masking curriculum encourages the network to become increasingly
robust to missing or occluded visual information, ultimately improving
structural understanding. Our complete pipeline consists of (1) self-supervised
pretraining of the encoder, (2) self-supervised attention learning, and (3)
supervised fine-tuning with a transformer decoder to generate LATEX sequences.
Extensive experiments on CROHME benchmarks demonstrate that our method
outperforms existing SSL and fully supervised baselines, validating the
effectiveness of our progressive attention mechanism in enhancing HMER
performance. Our codebase can be found here.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 情感在人类日常互动中至关重要，但现有动作生成框架未考虑情感因素，导致生成动作不够自然，限制了在交互任务中的应用。

Method: 采用半监督学习训练情感先验，并结合扩散模型生成反应动作，同时考虑空间交互和情感响应。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在反应动作生成任务中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过引入情感先验和扩散模型，本文方法能够生成更自然且情感丰富的反应动作，为交互任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Emotion serves as an essential component in daily human interactions.
Existing human motion generation frameworks do not consider the impact of
emotions, which reduces naturalness and limits their application in interactive
tasks, such as human reaction synthesis. In this work, we introduce a novel
task: generating diverse reaction motions in response to different emotional
cues. However, learning emotion representation from limited motion data and
incorporating it into a motion generation framework remains a challenging
problem. To address the above obstacles, we introduce a semi-supervised emotion
prior in an actor-reactor diffusion model to facilitate emotion-driven reaction
synthesis. Specifically, based on the observation that motion clips within a
short sequence tend to share the same emotion, we first devise a
semi-supervised learning framework to train an emotion prior. With this prior,
we further train an actor-reactor diffusion model to generate reactions by
considering both spatial interaction and emotional response. Finally, given a
motion sequence of an actor, our approach can generate realistic reactions
under various emotional conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that our
model outperforms existing reaction generation methods. The code and data will
be made publicly available at https://ereact.github.io/

TL;DR: FMCE-Net++是一种新的训练框架，通过结合FMCS预测和任务标签优化模型性能，无需修改架构或额外数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决DNN内部表示不透明的问题，FMCE缺乏实验验证和闭环集成。

Method: 提出FMCE-Net++框架，集成预训练的FMCE-Net作为辅助头，生成FMCS预测，并通过表示辅助损失（RAL）动态平衡分类损失和特征收敛优化。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，FMCE-Net++显著提升模型性能，如ResNet-50/CIFAR-10准确率提升1.16个百分点。

Conclusion: FMCE-Net++能有效提升模型性能，验证了其方法的有效性。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) face interpretability challenges due to their
opaque internal representations. While Feature Map Convergence Evaluation
(FMCE) quantifies module-level convergence via Feature Map Convergence Scores
(FMCS), it lacks experimental validation and closed-loop integration. To
address this limitation, we propose FMCE-Net++, a novel training framework that
integrates a pretrained, frozen FMCE-Net as an auxiliary head. This module
generates FMCS predictions, which, combined with task labels, jointly supervise
backbone optimization through a Representation Auxiliary Loss. The RAL
dynamically balances the primary classification loss and feature convergence
optimization via a tunable \Representation Abstraction Factor. Extensive
experiments conducted on MNIST, CIFAR-10, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR-100
demonstrate that FMCE-Net++ consistently enhances model performance without
architectural modifications or additional data. Key experimental outcomes
include accuracy gains of $+1.16$ pp (ResNet-50/CIFAR-10) and $+1.08$ pp
(ShuffleNet v2/CIFAR-100), validating that FMCE-Net++ can effectively elevate
state-of-the-art performance ceilings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散模型的生成框架UGD-IML，首次将IML和CIML任务统一在一个框架中，减少了对大规模标注数据的依赖，并在性能上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字时代中高级图像编辑工具威胁视觉内容的真实性，现有IML方法依赖大规模标注数据，但数据集规模不足且多样性有限，限制了模型在真实场景中的表现。

Method: 提出UGD-IML框架，利用扩散模型学习数据分布，减少对标注数据的依赖；通过类别嵌入机制和参数共享设计，实现IML和CIML任务的无缝切换。

Result: 在多个数据集上，UGD-IML在IML和CIML任务中的F1指标分别平均优于现有方法9.66和4.36，且在不确定性估计、可视化和鲁棒性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: UGD-IML通过生成模型和端到端设计，显著提升了图像篡改定位的性能和效率，为实际应用提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: In the digital age, advanced image editing tools pose a serious threat to the
integrity of visual content, making image forgery detection and localization a
key research focus. Most existing Image Manipulation Localization (IML) methods
rely on discriminative learning and require large, high-quality annotated
datasets. However, current datasets lack sufficient scale and diversity,
limiting model performance in real-world scenarios. To overcome this, recent
studies have explored Constrained IML (CIML), which generates pixel-level
annotations through algorithmic supervision. However, existing CIML approaches
often depend on complex multi-stage pipelines, making the annotation process
inefficient. In this work, we propose a novel generative framework based on
diffusion models, named UGD-IML, which for the first time unifies both IML and
CIML tasks within a single framework. By learning the underlying data
distribution, generative diffusion models inherently reduce the reliance on
large-scale labeled datasets, allowing our approach to perform effectively even
under limited data conditions. In addition, by leveraging a class embedding
mechanism and a parameter-sharing design, our model seamlessly switches between
IML and CIML modes without extra components or training overhead. Furthermore,
the end-to-end design enables our model to avoid cumbersome steps in the data
annotation process. Extensive experimental results on multiple datasets
demonstrate that UGD-IML outperforms the SOTA methods by an average of 9.66 and
4.36 in terms of F1 metrics for IML and CIML tasks, respectively. Moreover, the
proposed method also excels in uncertainty estimation, visualization and
robustness.

Result: MCA在传统和噪声3D基准测试中均达到最优性能。

Conclusion: MCA框架在噪声标签条件下表现出卓越的鲁棒性和有效性。

Abstract: With the increasing availability of 2D and 3D data, significant advancements
have been made in the field of cross-modal retrieval. Nevertheless, the
existence of imperfect annotations presents considerable challenges, demanding
robust solutions for 2D-3D cross-modal retrieval in the presence of noisy label
conditions. Existing methods generally address the issue of noise by dividing
samples independently within each modality, making them susceptible to
overfitting on corrupted labels. To address these issues, we propose a robust
2D-3D \textbf{M}ulti-level cross-modal adaptive \textbf{C}orrection and
\textbf{A}lignment framework (MCA). Specifically, we introduce a Multimodal
Joint label Correction (MJC) mechanism that leverages multimodal historical
self-predictions to jointly model the modality prediction consistency, enabling
reliable label refinement. Additionally, we propose a Multi-level Adaptive
Alignment (MAA) strategy to effectively enhance cross-modal feature semantics
and discrimination across different levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the superiority of our method, MCA, which achieves state-of-the-art performance
on both conventional and realistic noisy 3D benchmarks, highlighting its
generality and effectiveness.

Motivation: 现有开源多模态大语言模型在图表理解任务上表现不佳（成功率30%-50%），且合成图表与真实图表差异较大，影响模型训练效果。

Method: 设计五步数据合成流程：分离数据和函数生成单图、多子图条件生成、视觉多样化、数据质量过滤、使用GPT-4生成问答对。生成包含10k+图表和300k+问答对的ECD数据集。

Conclusion: 模块化和多样化视觉细节的图表生成方法有效提升了模型对复杂图表的理解能力，ECD数据集为相关研究提供了高质量资源。

Abstract: Being able to effectively read scientific plots, or chart understanding, is a
central part toward building effective agents for science. However, existing
multimodal large language models (MLLMs), especially open-source ones, are
still falling behind with a typical success rate of 30%-50% on challenging
benchmarks. Previous studies on fine-tuning MLLMs with synthetic charts are
often restricted by their inadequate similarity to the real charts, which could
compromise model training and performance on complex real-world charts. In this
study, we show that modularizing chart generation and diversifying visual
details improves chart understanding capabilities. In particular, we design a
five-step data synthesis pipeline, where we separate data and function creation
for single plot generation, condition the generation of later subplots on
earlier ones for multi-subplot figures, visually diversify the generated
figures, filter out low quality data, and finally generate the question-answer
(QA) pairs with GPT-4o. This approach allows us to streamline the generation of
fine-tuning datasets and introduce the effective chart dataset (ECD), which
contains 10k+ chart images and 300k+ QA pairs, covering 25 topics and featuring
250+ chart type combinations with high visual complexity. We show that ECD
consistently improves the performance of various MLLMs on a range of real-world
and synthetic test sets. Code, data and models are available at:

Conclusion: 显式3D建模结合自适应变形显著提升了视线重定向的逼真度和准确性。

Abstract: We propose a novel 3D gaze redirection framework that leverages an explicit
3D eyeball structure. Existing gaze redirection methods are typically based on
neural radiance fields, which employ implicit neural representations via volume
rendering. Unlike these NeRF-based approaches, where the rotation and
translation of 3D representations are not explicitly modeled, we introduce a
dedicated 3D eyeball structure to represent the eyeballs with 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS). Our method generates photorealistic images that faithfully
reproduce the desired gaze direction by explicitly rotating and translating the
3D eyeball structure. In addition, we propose an adaptive deformation module
that enables the replication of subtle muscle movements around the eyes.
Through experiments conducted on the ETH-XGaze dataset, we demonstrate that our
framework is capable of generating diverse novel gaze images, achieving
superior image quality and gaze estimation accuracy compared to previous
state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的自动驾驶方法依赖Transformer融合，但其二次计算复杂度和缺乏空间先验限制了高分辨率特征的使用和BEV表示的有效建模。

Method: 1. 使用几何增强的LiDAR表示替代传统直方图表示；2. 提出分层门控Mamba融合（GM-Fusion）架构，用高效的SSM替代Transformer。

Result: 在NAVSIM基准测试中，GMF-Drive显著优于DiffusionDrive，达到新的SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 任务特定的SSM在性能和效率上均优于通用Transformer，验证了GMF-Drive的有效性。

Abstract: Diffusion-based models are redefining the state-of-the-art in end-to-end
autonomous driving, yet their performance is increasingly hampered by a
reliance on transformer-based fusion. These architectures face fundamental
limitations: quadratic computational complexity restricts the use of
high-resolution features, and a lack of spatial priors prevents them from
effectively modeling the inherent structure of Bird's Eye View (BEV)
representations. This paper introduces GMF-Drive (Gated Mamba Fusion for
Driving), an end-to-end framework that overcomes these challenges through two
principled innovations. First, we supersede the information-limited
histogram-based LiDAR representation with a geometrically-augmented pillar
format encoding shape descriptors and statistical features, preserving critical
3D geometric details. Second, we propose a novel hierarchical gated mamba
fusion (GM-Fusion) architecture that substitutes an expensive transformer with
a highly efficient, spatially-aware state-space model (SSM). Our core BEV-SSM
leverages directional sequencing and adaptive fusion mechanisms to capture
long-range dependencies with linear complexity, while explicitly respecting the
unique spatial properties of the driving scene. Extensive experiments on the
challenging NAVSIM benchmark demonstrate that GMF-Drive achieves a new
state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming DiffusionDrive.
Comprehensive ablation studies validate the efficacy of each component,
demonstrating that task-specific SSMs can surpass a general-purpose transformer
in both performance and efficiency for autonomous driving.

Result: 在SeaThru-NeRF和UWBundle数据集上表现优异，PSNR达27.604，SSIM为0.868，LPIPS为0.104，浮游伪影减少约65%。

Conclusion: UW-3DGS通过物理建模和自适应修剪，显著提升了水下3D重建的精度和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Underwater 3D scene reconstruction faces severe challenges from light
absorption, scattering, and turbidity, which degrade geometry and color
fidelity in traditional methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). While NeRF
extensions such as SeaThru-NeRF incorporate physics-based models, their MLP
reliance limits efficiency and spatial resolution in hazy environments. We
introduce UW-3DGS, a novel framework adapting 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for
robust underwater reconstruction. Key innovations include: (1) a plug-and-play
learnable underwater image formation module using voxel-based regression for
spatially varying attenuation and backscatter; and (2) a Physics-Aware
Uncertainty Pruning (PAUP) branch that adaptively removes noisy floating
Gaussians via uncertainty scoring, ensuring artifact-free geometry. The
pipeline operates in training and rendering stages. During training, noisy
Gaussians are optimized end-to-end with underwater parameters, guided by PAUP
pruning and scattering modeling. In rendering, refined Gaussians produce clean
Unattenuated Radiance Images (URIs) free from media effects, while learned
physics enable realistic Underwater Images (UWIs) with accurate light
transport. Experiments on SeaThru-NeRF and UWBundle datasets show superior
performance, achieving PSNR of 27.604, SSIM of 0.868, and LPIPS of 0.104 on
SeaThru-NeRF, with ~65% reduction in floating artifacts.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation in open-vocabulary scenarios presents significant
challenges due to the wide range and granularity of semantic categories.
Existing weakly-supervised methods often rely on category-specific supervision
and ill-suited feature construction methods for contrastive learning, leading
to semantic misalignment and poor performance. In this work, we propose a novel
weakly-supervised approach, SynSeg, to address the challenges. SynSeg performs
Multi-Category Contrastive Learning (MCCL) as a stronger training signal with a
new feature reconstruction framework named Feature Synergy Structure (FSS).
Specifically, MCCL strategy robustly combines both intra- and inter-category
alignment and separation in order to make the model learn the knowledge of
correlations from different categories within the same image. Moreover, FSS
reconstructs discriminative features for contrastive learning through prior
fusion and semantic-activation-map enhancement, effectively avoiding the
foreground bias introduced by the visual encoder. In general, SynSeg
effectively improves the abilities in semantic localization and discrimination
under weak supervision. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that
our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. For instance,
SynSeg achieves higher accuracy than SOTA baselines by 4.5\% on VOC, 8.9\% on
Context, 2.6\% on Object and 2.0\% on City.

Conclusion: CAE高效学习潜在空间，但缺乏物理可解释性，未来可开发物理信息版本的CAE。

Abstract: This study applied representation learning algorithms to satellite images and
evaluated the learned latent spaces with classifications of various weather
events. The algorithms investigated include the classical linear
transformation, i.e., principal component analysis (PCA), state-of-the-art deep
learning method, i.e., convolutional autoencoder (CAE), and a residual network
pre-trained with large image datasets (PT). The experiment results indicated
that the latent space learned by CAE consistently showed higher threat scores
for all classification tasks. The classifications with PCA yielded high hit
rates but also high false-alarm rates. In addition, the PT performed
exceptionally well at recognizing tropical cyclones but was inferior in other
tasks. Further experiments suggested that representations learned from
higher-resolution datasets are superior in all classification tasks for
deep-learning algorithms, i.e., CAE and PT. We also found that smaller latent
space sizes had minor impact on the classification task's hit rate. Still, a
latent space dimension smaller than 128 caused a significantly higher false
alarm rate. Though the CAE can learn latent spaces effectively and efficiently,
the interpretation of the learned representation lacks direct connections to
physical attributions. Therefore, developing a physics-informed version of CAE
can be a promising outlook for the current work.

Result: 在多样化CVIT基准测试中表现优异，显著提高参数效率。

Conclusion: LiLoRA在持续任务学习中表现优越，且参数效率显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Continual Visual Instruction Tuning (CVIT) enables Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) to incrementally learn new tasks over time. However, this
process is challenged by catastrophic forgetting, where performance on
previously learned tasks deteriorates as the model adapts to new ones. A common
approach to mitigate forgetting is architecture expansion, which introduces
task-specific modules to prevent interference. Yet, existing methods often
expand entire layers for each task, leading to significant parameter overhead
and poor scalability. To overcome these issues, we introduce LoRA in LoRA
(LiLoRA), a highly efficient architecture expansion method tailored for CVIT in
MLLMs. LiLoRA shares the LoRA matrix A across tasks to reduce redundancy,
applies an additional low-rank decomposition to matrix B to minimize
task-specific parameters, and incorporates a cosine-regularized stability loss
to preserve consistency in shared representations over time. Extensive
experiments on a diverse CVIT benchmark show that LiLoRA consistently achieves
superior performance in sequential task learning while significantly improving
parameter efficiency compared to existing approaches.

TL;DR: SC-Captioner是一个基于强化学习的框架，通过设计奖励函数提升图像描述模型的自我修正能力，显著优于直接偏好优化策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像描述模型缺乏自我修正能力，导致生成的描述不够准确。SC-Captioner旨在通过强化学习框架解决这一问题。

Method: 使用场景图解析算法分解预测和参考描述，计算集合差异以识别修正元素，并通过匹配参考集设计奖励函数。

Result: 实验表明，SC-Captioner能生成更优的图像描述，显著优于直接偏好优化策略。

Conclusion: SC-Captioner通过强化学习框架和精细的奖励设计，有效提升了图像描述模型的自我修正能力和生成质量。

Abstract: We propose SC-Captioner, a reinforcement learning framework that enables the
self-correcting capability of image caption models. Our crucial technique lies
in the design of the reward function to incentivize accurate caption
corrections. Specifically, the predicted and reference captions are decomposed
into object, attribute, and relation sets using scene-graph parsing algorithms.
We calculate the set difference between sets of initial and self-corrected
captions to identify added and removed elements. These elements are matched
against the reference sets to calculate correctness bonuses for accurate
refinements and mistake punishments for wrong additions and removals, thereby
forming the final reward. For image caption quality assessment, we propose a
set of metrics refined from CAPTURE that alleviate its incomplete precision
evaluation and inefficient relation matching problems. Furthermore, we collect
a fine-grained annotated image caption dataset, RefinedCaps, consisting of 6.5K
diverse images from COCO dataset. Experiments show that applying SC-Captioner
on large visual-language models can generate better image captions across
various scenarios, significantly outperforming the direct preference
optimization training strategy.

TL;DR: VeSCA是一种新方法，通过利用SAM的编码器生成可转移的对抗样本，显著提升了对抗攻击的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估SAM的潜在漏洞对下游应用的影响，并解决现有对抗攻击方法在转移性上的不足。

Method: 提出VeSCA方法，通过参数化单纯复形表征共享脆弱区域，并结合轻量级领域适应策略。

Result: VeSCA在五个领域数据集上性能提升12.7%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SAM的漏洞对下游模型构成风险，强调了开发更鲁棒基础模型的紧迫性。

Abstract: While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) transforms interactive segmentation
with zero-shot abilities, its inherent vulnerabilities present a single-point
risk, potentially leading to the failure of numerous downstream applications.
Proactively evaluating these transferable vulnerabilities is thus imperative.
Prior adversarial attacks on SAM often present limited transferability due to
insufficient exploration of common weakness across domains. To address this, we
propose Vertex-Refining Simplicial Complex Attack (VeSCA), a novel method that
leverages only the encoder of SAM for generating transferable adversarial
examples. Specifically, it achieves this by explicitly characterizing the
shared vulnerable regions between SAM and downstream models through a
parametric simplicial complex. Our goal is to identify such complexes within
adversarially potent regions by iterative vertex-wise refinement. A lightweight
domain re-adaptation strategy is introduced to bridge domain divergence using
minimal reference data during the initialization of simplicial complex.
Ultimately, VeSCA generates consistently transferable adversarial examples
through random simplicial complex sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that VeSCA achieves performance improved by 12.7% compared to state-of-the-art
methods across three downstream model categories across five domain-specific
datasets. Our findings further highlight the downstream model risks posed by
SAM's vulnerabilities and emphasize the urgency of developing more robust
foundation models.

Result: 实验表明，SIFThinker在空间理解和细粒度感知任务中优于现有方法，同时保持通用能力。

Conclusion: SIFThinker通过空间感知和动态注意力修正，显著提升了复杂视觉任务的性能。

Abstract: Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) still face significant
challenges in complex visual tasks (e.g., spatial understanding, fine-grained
perception). Prior methods have tried to incorporate visual reasoning, however,
they fail to leverage attention correction with spatial cues to iteratively
refine their focus on prompt-relevant regions. In this paper, we introduce
SIFThinker, a spatially-aware "think-with-images" framework that mimics human
visual perception. Specifically, SIFThinker enables attention correcting and
image region focusing by interleaving depth-enhanced bounding boxes and natural
language. Our contributions are twofold: First, we introduce a
reverse-expansion-forward-inference strategy that facilitates the generation of
interleaved image-text chains of thought for process-level supervision, which
in turn leads to the construction of the SIF-50K dataset. Besides, we propose
GRPO-SIF, a reinforced training paradigm that integrates depth-informed visual
grounding into a unified reasoning pipeline, teaching the model to dynamically
correct and focus on prompt-relevant regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that SIFThinker outperforms state-of-the-art methods in spatial understanding
and fine-grained visual perception, while maintaining strong general
capabilities, highlighting the effectiveness of our method.

Motivation: 结合稀疏IMU和单目摄像头进行实时运动捕捉是一个有前景的方向，但需要解决视觉信息偶尔缺失和IMU信号稳定性的问题。

Method: 将视觉信息整体转化为条件嵌入，而IMU测量与噪声姿态逐帧拼接作为扩散模型的输入，以充分利用两种信号的优势。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在姿态估计上表现优异，性能达到当前最佳水平。

Conclusion: 提出的扩散模型框架有效融合了视觉和IMU信号，解决了视觉信息不稳定的问题，并提升了运动捕捉的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Combining sparse IMUs and a monocular camera is a new promising setting to
perform real-time human motion capture. This paper proposes a diffusion-based
solution to learn human motion priors and fuse the two modalities of signals
together seamlessly in a unified framework. By delicately considering the
characteristics of the two signals, the sequential visual information is
considered as a whole and transformed into a condition embedding, while the
inertial measurement is concatenated with the noisy body pose frame by frame to
construct a sequential input for the diffusion model. Firstly, we observe that
the visual information may be unavailable in some frames due to occlusions or
subjects moving out of the camera view. Thus incorporating the sequential
visual features as a whole to get a single feature embedding is robust to the
occasional degenerations of visual information in those frames. On the other
hand, the IMU measurements are robust to occlusions and always stable when
signal transmission has no problem. So incorporating them frame-wisely could
better explore the temporal information for the system. Experiments have
demonstrated the effectiveness of the system design and its state-of-the-art
performance in pose estimation compared with the previous works. Our codes are
available for research at https://shaohua-pan.github.io/diffcap-page.

Motivation: 现有弱监督视频异常检测模型难以处理复杂异常事件，且缺乏类别特异性建模和精确的时序信息。

Method: 提出GS-MoE框架，结合专家模型和时序高斯损失，增强异常检测的类别特异性和时序一致性。

Result: 在UCF-Crime、XD-Violence和MSAD数据集上分别达到91.58% AUC，性能最优。

Conclusion: GS-MoE通过类别特异性建模和时序指导，为弱监督视频异常检测设定了新基准。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) is a challenging task due to the variability of
anomalous events and the limited availability of labeled data. Under the
Weakly-Supervised VAD (WSVAD) paradigm, only video-level labels are provided
during training, while predictions are made at the frame level. Although
state-of-the-art models perform well on simple anomalies (e.g., explosions),
they struggle with complex real-world events (e.g., shoplifting). This
difficulty stems from two key issues: (1) the inability of current models to
address the diversity of anomaly types, as they process all categories with a
shared model, overlooking category-specific features; and (2) the weak
supervision signal, which lacks precise temporal information, limiting the
ability to capture nuanced anomalous patterns blended with normal events. To
address these challenges, we propose Gaussian Splatting-guided Mixture of
Experts (GS-MoE), a novel framework that employs a set of expert models, each
specialized in capturing specific anomaly types. These experts are guided by a
temporal Gaussian splatting loss, enabling the model to leverage temporal
consistency and enhance weak supervision. The Gaussian splatting approach
encourages a more precise and comprehensive representation of anomalies by
focusing on temporal segments most likely to contain abnormal events. The
predictions from these specialized experts are integrated through a
mixture-of-experts mechanism to model complex relationships across diverse
anomaly patterns. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a
91.58% AUC on the UCF-Crime dataset, and demonstrates superior results on
XD-Violence and MSAD datasets. By leveraging category-specific expertise and
temporal guidance, GS-MoE sets a new benchmark for VAD under weak supervision.

Result: 实验表明SDEval显著影响安全评估，减轻数据污染，并暴露MLLMs的安全限制。

Conclusion: SDEval为MLLMs的安全评估提供了通用且有效的动态框架。

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), the safety concerns of their outputs have earned significant
attention. Although numerous datasets have been proposed, they may become
outdated with MLLM advancements and are susceptible to data contamination
issues. To address these problems, we propose \textbf{SDEval}, the
\textit{first} safety dynamic evaluation framework to controllably adjust the
distribution and complexity of safety benchmarks. Specifically, SDEval mainly
adopts three dynamic strategies: text, image, and text-image dynamics to
generate new samples from original benchmarks. We first explore the individual
effects of text and image dynamics on model safety. Then, we find that
injecting text dynamics into images can further impact safety, and conversely,
injecting image dynamics into text also leads to safety risks. SDEval is
general enough to be applied to various existing safety and even capability
benchmarks. Experiments across safety benchmarks, MLLMGuard and VLSBench, and
capability benchmarks, MMBench and MMVet, show that SDEval significantly
influences safety evaluation, mitigates data contamination, and exposes safety
limitations of MLLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/hq-King/SDEval

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal vision models have highlighted limitations
in late-stage feature fusion and suboptimal query selection for hybrid prompts
open-world segmentation, alongside constraints from caption-derived
vocabularies. To address these challenges, we propose Prompt-DINO, a
text-guided visual Prompt DINO framework featuring three key innovations.
First, we introduce an early fusion mechanism that unifies text/visual prompts
and backbone features at the initial encoding stage, enabling deeper
cross-modal interactions to resolve semantic ambiguities. Second, we design
order-aligned query selection for DETR-based architectures, explicitly
optimizing the structural alignment between text and visual queries during
decoding to enhance semantic-spatial consistency. Third, we develop a
generative data engine powered by the Recognize Anything via Prompting (RAP)
model, which synthesizes 0.5B diverse training instances through a dual-path
cross-verification pipeline, reducing label noise by 80.5% compared to
conventional approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Prompt-DINO
achieves state-of-the-art performance on open-world detection benchmarks while
significantly expanding semantic coverage beyond fixed-vocabulary constraints.

Motivation: 解决传统方法仅依赖相似度阈值判断库外结果的局限性，提出利用额外注册图像信息提高判断准确性。

Method: 通过提取排名第一身份的额外注册图像排名生成训练数据，训练分类器预测库内/库外结果。

Result: 实验表明该方法适用于多种图像质量（如模糊、分辨率降低等）和不同人口统计群体，且准确性相似。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效减少误识别和调查时间浪费，且其效果依赖于先进的基于边际损失的匹配器。

Abstract: A central problem in one-to-many facial identification is that the person in
the probe image may or may not have enrolled image(s) in the gallery; that is,
may be In-gallery or Out-of-gallery. Past approaches to detect when a rank-one
result is Out-of-gallery have mostly focused on finding a suitable threshold on
the similarity score. We take a new approach, using the additional enrolled
images of the identity with the rank-one result to predict if the rank-one
result is In-gallery / Out-of-gallery. Given a gallery of identities and
images, we generate In-gallery and Out-of-gallery training data by extracting
the ranks of additional enrolled images corresponding to the rank-one identity.
We then train a classifier to utilize this feature vector to predict whether a
rank-one result is In-gallery or Out-of-gallery. Using two different datasets
and four different matchers, we present experimental results showing that our
approach is viable for mugshot quality probe images, and also, importantly, for
probes degraded by blur, reduced resolution, atmospheric turbulence and
sunglasses. We also analyze results across demographic groups, and show that
In-gallery / Out-of-gallery classification accuracy is similar across
demographics. Our approach has the potential to provide an objective estimate
of whether a one-to-many facial identification is Out-of-gallery, and thereby
to reduce false positive identifications, wrongful arrests, and wasted
investigative time. Interestingly, comparing the results of older deep
CNN-based face matchers with newer ones suggests that the effectiveness of our
Out-of-gallery detection approach emerges only with matchers trained using
advanced margin-based loss functions.

Conclusion: DSConv在多光谱和全色图像融合任务中具有优越性和最佳适用条件。

Abstract: Aiming to obtain a high-resolution image, pansharpening involves the fusion
of a multi-spectral image (MS) and a panchromatic image (PAN), the low-level
vision task remaining significant and challenging in contemporary research.
Most existing approaches rely predominantly on standard convolutions, few
making the effort to adaptive convolutions, which are effective owing to the
inter-pixel correlations of remote sensing images. In this paper, we propose a
novel strategy for dynamically splitting convolution kernels in conjunction
with attention, selecting positions of interest, and splitting the original
convolution kernel into multiple smaller kernels, named DSConv. The proposed
DSConv more effectively extracts features of different positions within the
receptive field, enhancing the network's generalization, optimization, and
feature representation capabilities. Furthermore, we innovate and enrich
concepts of dynamic splitting convolution and provide a novel network
architecture for pansharpening capable of achieving the tasks more efficiently,
building upon this methodology. Adequate fair experiments illustrate the
effectiveness and the state-of-the-art performance attained by
DSConv.Comprehensive and rigorous discussions proved the superiority and
optimal usage conditions of DSConv.

Abstract: High-resolution imagery plays a critical role in improving the performance of
visual recognition tasks such as classification, detection, and segmentation.
In many domains, including remote sensing and surveillance, low-resolution
images can limit the accuracy of automated analysis. To address this,
super-resolution (SR) techniques have been widely adopted to attempt to
reconstruct high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs. Related
traditional approaches focus solely on enhancing image quality based on
pixel-level metrics, leaving the relationship between super-resolved image
fidelity and downstream classification performance largely underexplored. This
raises a key question: can integrating classification objectives directly into
the super-resolution process further improve classification accuracy? In this
paper, we try to respond to this question by investigating the relationship
between super-resolution and classification through the deployment of a
specialised algorithmic strategy. We propose a novel methodology that increases
the resolution of synthetic aperture radar imagery by optimising loss functions
that account for both image quality and classification performance. Our
approach improves image quality, as measured by scientifically ascertained
image quality indicators, while also enhancing classification accuracy.

Abstract: We present VISTAR, a user-centric, multi-dimensional benchmark for
text-to-image (T2I) evaluation that addresses the limitations of existing
metrics. VISTAR introduces a two-tier hybrid paradigm: it employs
deterministic, scriptable metrics for physically quantifiable attributes (e.g.,
text rendering, lighting) and a novel Hierarchical Weighted P/N Questioning
(HWPQ) scheme that uses constrained vision-language models to assess abstract
semantics (e.g., style fusion, cultural fidelity). Grounded in a Delphi study
with 120 experts, we defined seven user roles and nine evaluation angles to
construct the benchmark, which comprises 2,845 prompts validated by over 15,000
human pairwise comparisons. Our metrics achieve high human alignment (>75%),
with the HWPQ scheme reaching 85.9% accuracy on abstract semantics,
significantly outperforming VQA baselines. Comprehensive evaluation of
state-of-the-art models reveals no universal champion, as role-weighted scores
reorder rankings and provide actionable guidance for domain-specific
deployment. All resources are publicly released to foster reproducible T2I
assessment.

Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized medical imaging, but its effectiveness is
severely limited by insufficient labeled training data. This paper introduces a
novel GAN-based semi-supervised learning framework specifically designed for
low labeled-data regimes, evaluated across settings with 5 to 50 labeled
samples per class. Our approach integrates three specialized neural networks --
a generator for class-conditioned image translation, a discriminator for
authenticity assessment and classification, and a dedicated classifier --
within a three-phase training framework. The method alternates between
supervised training on limited labeled data and unsupervised learning that
leverages abundant unlabeled images through image-to-image translation rather
than generation from noise. We employ ensemble-based pseudo-labeling that
combines confidence-weighted predictions from the discriminator and classifier
with temporal consistency through exponential moving averaging, enabling
reliable label estimation for unlabeled data. Comprehensive evaluation across
eleven MedMNIST datasets demonstrates that our approach achieves statistically
significant improvements over six state-of-the-art GAN-based semi-supervised
methods, with particularly strong performance in the extreme 5-shot setting
where the scarcity of labeled data is most challenging. The framework maintains
its superiority across all evaluated settings (5, 10, 20, and 50 shots per
class). Our approach offers a practical solution for medical imaging
applications where annotation costs are prohibitive, enabling robust
classification performance even with minimal labeled data. Code is available at

Conclusion: MPF-KANSC为AD诊断提供了更精确和可解释的方法，具有潜在临床应用价值。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that
severely impairs cognitive function and quality of life. Timely intervention in
AD relies heavily on early and precise diagnosis, which remains challenging due
to the complex and subtle structural changes in the brain. Most existing deep
learning methods focus only on a single plane of structural magnetic resonance
imaging (sMRI) and struggle to accurately capture the complex and nonlinear
relationships among pathological regions of the brain, thus limiting their
ability to precisely identify atrophic features. To overcome these limitations,
we propose an innovative framework, MPF-KANSC, which integrates multi-plane
fusion (MPF) for combining features from the coronal, sagittal, and axial
planes, and a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network-guided spatial-channel attention
mechanism (KANSC) to more effectively learn and represent sMRI atrophy
features. Specifically, the proposed model enables parallel feature extraction
from multiple anatomical planes, thus capturing more comprehensive structural
information. The KANSC attention mechanism further leverages a more flexible
and accurate nonlinear function approximation technique, facilitating precise
identification and localization of disease-related abnormalities. Experiments
on the ADNI dataset confirm that the proposed MPF-KANSC achieves superior
performance in AD diagnosis. Moreover, our findings provide new evidence of
right-lateralized asymmetry in subcortical structural changes during AD
progression, highlighting the model's promising interpretability.

is it more effective to reduce the number of denoising steps or to use a
cheaper per-step inference? Intuitively, reducing the number of denoising steps
increases the variability of the distributions across steps, making the model
more sensitive to compression. In contrast, keeping more denoising steps makes
the differences smaller, preserving redundancy, and making post-training
compression more feasible. To systematically examine this, we propose PostDiff,
a training-free framework for accelerating pre-trained diffusion models by
reducing redundancy at both the input level and module level in a post-training
manner. At the input level, we propose a mixed-resolution denoising scheme
based on the insight that reducing generation resolution in early denoising
steps can enhance low-frequency components and improve final generation
fidelity. At the module level, we employ a hybrid module caching strategy to
reuse computations across denoising steps. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies demonstrate that (1) PostDiff can significantly improve the
fidelity-efficiency trade-off of state-of-the-art diffusion models, and (2) to
boost efficiency while maintaining decent generation fidelity, reducing
per-step inference cost is often more effective than reducing the number of
denoising steps. Our code is available at

TL;DR: CLIPin是一种非对比式插件，可无缝集成到CLIP架构中，提升多模态语义对齐能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模自然图像-文本数据集语义对齐松散和医学数据集内容多样性低的问题，以提高CLIP模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Method: 设计CLIPin插件，引入两个共享预投影器，结合对比和非对比学习。

Result: 在多样化下游任务中验证了CLIPin的有效性和通用性。

Conclusion: CLIPin是一种兼容性强、即插即用的组件，能显著提升多模态对齐效果。

Abstract: Large-scale natural image-text datasets, especially those automatically
collected from the web, often suffer from loose semantic alignment due to weak
supervision, while medical datasets tend to have high cross-modal correlation
but low content diversity. These properties pose a common challenge for
contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP): they hinder the model's ability
to learn robust and generalizable representations. In this work, we propose
CLIPin, a unified non-contrastive plug-in that can be seamlessly integrated
into CLIP-style architectures to improve multimodal semantic alignment,
providing stronger supervision and enhancing alignment robustness. Furthermore,
two shared pre-projectors are designed for image and text modalities
respectively to facilitate the integration of contrastive and non-contrastive
learning in a parameter-compromise manner. Extensive experiments on diverse
downstream tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of CLIPin as a
plug-and-play component compatible with various contrastive frameworks. Code is

Abstract: Segmentation of lesions on CT enables automatic measurement for clinical

models (LLMs) into the lesion segmentation workflow offers the potential to
combine imaging features with descriptions of lesion characteristics from the

Conclusion: MA-CBP为城市公共安全风险预警提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: With the acceleration of urbanization, criminal behavior in public scenes
poses an increasingly serious threat to social security. Traditional anomaly
detection methods based on feature recognition struggle to capture high-level
behavioral semantics from historical information, while generative approaches
based on Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to meet real-time
requirements. To address these challenges, we propose MA-CBP, a criminal
behavior prediction framework based on multi-agent asynchronous collaboration.
This framework transforms real-time video streams into frame-level semantic
descriptions, constructs causally consistent historical summaries, and fuses
adjacent image frames to perform joint reasoning over long- and short-term
contexts. The resulting behavioral decisions include key elements such as event
subjects, locations, and causes, enabling early warning of potential criminal
activity. In addition, we construct a high-quality criminal behavior dataset
that provides multi-scale language supervision, including frame-level,
summary-level, and event-level semantic annotations. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance on multiple datasets
and offers a promising solution for risk warning in urban public safety
scenarios.

Method: 设计了双域特征解耦模块（DDFD）和分支交互注意力融合模块（BIAF），结合嵌套深度监督机制，实现多尺度特征互补和动态特征融合。

Result: 在1622张胸水CT图像上验证，IoU和Dice分数分别达到80.1%和89.0%，优于现有模型。

Conclusion: DBIF-AUNet显著提升了复杂胸水CT图像的分割精度，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Pleural effusion semantic segmentation can significantly enhance the accuracy
and timeliness of clinical diagnosis and treatment by precisely identifying
disease severity and lesion areas. Currently, semantic segmentation of pleural
effusion CT images faces multiple challenges. These include similar gray levels
between effusion and surrounding tissues, blurred edges, and variable
morphology. Existing methods often struggle with diverse image variations and
complex edges, primarily because direct feature concatenation causes semantic
gaps. To address these challenges, we propose the Dual-Branch Interactive
Fusion Attention model (DBIF-AUNet). This model constructs a densely nested
skip-connection network and innovatively refines the Dual-Domain Feature
Disentanglement module (DDFD). The DDFD module orthogonally decouples the
functions of dual-domain modules to achieve multi-scale feature complementarity
and enhance characteristics at different levels. Concurrently, we design a
Branch Interaction Attention Fusion module (BIAF) that works synergistically
with the DDFD. This module dynamically weights and fuses global, local, and
frequency band features, thereby improving segmentation robustness.
Furthermore, we implement a nested deep supervision mechanism with hierarchical
adaptive hybrid loss to effectively address class imbalance. Through validation
on 1,622 pleural effusion CT images from Southwest Hospital, DBIF-AUNet
achieved IoU and Dice scores of 80.1% and 89.0% respectively. These results
outperform state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models U-Net++ and
Swin-UNet by 5.7%/2.7% and 2.2%/1.5% respectively, demonstrating significant
optimization in segmentation accuracy for complex pleural effusion CT images.

Motivation: 城市化、气候变化和农业压力增加了对精确及时环境监测的需求，而现有遥感系统在空间和时间分辨率之间存在权衡。

Method: WGAST采用条件生成对抗网络架构，包括特征提取、融合、LST重建和噪声抑制四个阶段，并结合弱监督训练策略。

Result: 实验表明，WGAST在定量和定性评估中均优于现有方法，平均降低RMSE 17.18%，提高SSIM 11.00%。

Conclusion: WGAST能够有效捕捉精细尺度的热模式，并对云干扰具有鲁棒性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Urbanization, climate change, and agricultural stress are increasing the
demand for precise and timely environmental monitoring. Land Surface
Temperature (LST) is a key variable in this context and is retrieved from
remote sensing satellites. However, these systems face a trade-off between
spatial and temporal resolution. While spatio-temporal fusion methods offer
promising solutions, few have addressed the estimation of daily LST at 10 m
resolution. In this study, we present WGAST, a Weakly-Supervised Generative
Network for Daily 10 m LST Estimation via Spatio-Temporal Fusion of Terra
MODIS, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2. WGAST is the first end-to-end deep learning
framework designed for this task. It adopts a conditional generative
adversarial architecture, with a generator composed of four stages: feature
extraction, fusion, LST reconstruction, and noise suppression. The first stage
employs a set of encoders to extract multi-level latent representations from
the inputs, which are then fused in the second stage using cosine similarity,
normalization, and temporal attention mechanisms. The third stage decodes the
fused features into high-resolution LST, followed by a Gaussian filter to
suppress high-frequency noise. Training follows a weakly supervised strategy
based on physical averaging principles and reinforced by a PatchGAN
discriminator. Experiments demonstrate that WGAST outperforms existing methods
in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Compared to the
best-performing baseline, on average, WGAST reduces RMSE by 17.18% and improves
SSIM by 11.00%. Furthermore, WGAST is robust to cloud-induced LST and
effectively captures fine-scale thermal patterns, as validated against 33
ground-based sensors. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有异常检测方法高度专业化，泛化能力有限，无法适应多领域和多模态需求。

Method: AnomalyMoE采用三个专家网络分别处理局部结构异常、组件级语义异常和全局逻辑异常，并引入EIR和ESB模块优化专家多样性和利用率。

Result: 在8个挑战性数据集上，AnomalyMoE表现优于现有专用方法，达到新SOTA性能。

Conclusion: AnomalyMoE通过分层设计和模块优化，实现了通用且高效的异常检测。

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a critical task across numerous domains and modalities,
yet existing methods are often highly specialized, limiting their
generalizability. These specialized models, tailored for specific anomaly types
like textural defects or logical errors, typically exhibit limited performance
when deployed outside their designated contexts. To overcome this limitation,
we propose AnomalyMoE, a novel and universal anomaly detection framework based
on a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. Our key insight is to decompose the
complex anomaly detection problem into three distinct semantic hierarchies:
local structural anomalies, component-level semantic anomalies, and global
logical anomalies. AnomalyMoE correspondingly employs three dedicated expert
networks at the patch, component, and global levels, and is specialized in
reconstructing features and identifying deviations at its designated semantic
level. This hierarchical design allows a single model to concurrently
understand and detect a wide spectrum of anomalies. Furthermore, we introduce
an Expert Information Repulsion (EIR) module to promote expert diversity and an
Expert Selection Balancing (ESB) module to ensure the comprehensive utilization
of all experts. Experiments on 8 challenging datasets spanning industrial
imaging, 3D point clouds, medical imaging, video surveillance, and logical
anomaly detection demonstrate that AnomalyMoE establishes new state-of-the-art
performance, significantly outperforming specialized methods in their
respective domains.

Conclusion: PA-HOI数据集为研究物体物理属性对人类运动的影响提供了重要资源，并展示了实际应用的潜力。

Abstract: The Human-Object Interaction (HOI) task explores the dynamic interactions
between humans and objects in physical environments, providing essential
biomechanical and cognitive-behavioral foundations for fields such as robotics,
virtual reality, and human-computer interaction. However, existing HOI data
sets focus on details of affordance, often neglecting the influence of physical
properties of objects on human long-term motion. To bridge this gap, we
introduce the PA-HOI Motion Capture dataset, which highlights the impact of
objects' physical attributes on human motion dynamics, including human posture,
moving velocity, and other motion characteristics. The dataset comprises 562
motion sequences of human-object interactions, with each sequence performed by
subjects of different genders interacting with 35 3D objects that vary in size,
shape, and weight. This dataset stands out by significantly extending the scope
of existing ones for understanding how the physical attributes of different
objects influence human posture, speed, motion scale, and interacting
strategies. We further demonstrate the applicability of the PA-HOI dataset by
integrating it with existing motion generation methods, validating its capacity
to transfer realistic physical awareness.

Motivation: SvdH评分在临床实践中因复杂性难以广泛应用，手动评分效率低，需自动化解决方案。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：1)提取异常区域；2)基于注意力机制的多实例学习整合特征。提出两种区域提取方案：异常区域采样和关节区域裁剪。

Result: 最佳模型PCC达0.943，RMSE为15.73；集成学习后PCC提升至0.945，RMSE降至15.57，接近放射科医生水平。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且可解释，能识别临床相关解剖结构，为RA进展评估提供可靠工具。

Abstract: The Sharp/van der Heijde (SvdH) score has been widely used in clinical trials
to quantify radiographic damage in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), but its
complexity has limited its adoption in routine clinical practice. To address
the inefficiency of manual scoring, this work proposes a two-stage pipeline for
interpretable image-level SvdH score prediction using dual-hand radiographs.
Our approach extracts disease-relevant image regions and integrates them using
attention-based multiple instance learning to generate image-level features for
prediction. We propose two region extraction schemes: 1) sampling image tiles
most likely to contain abnormalities, and 2) cropping patches containing
disease-relevant joints. With Scheme 2, our best individual score prediction
model achieved a Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.943 and a root
mean squared error (RMSE) of 15.73. Ensemble learning further boosted
prediction accuracy, yielding a PCC of 0.945 and RMSE of 15.57, achieving
state-of-the-art performance that is comparable to that of experienced
radiologists (PCC = 0.97, RMSE = 18.75). Finally, our pipeline effectively
identified and made decisions based on anatomical structures which clinicians
consider relevant to RA progression.

<details>

Motivation: 城市遥感图像中地理对象的纹理差异小、空间结构相似，导致语义模糊和误分类，同时不规则形状和模糊边界增加了分割难度。

Method: 设计了纹理感知模块（TaM）捕捉纹理差异，构建边缘引导的三分支解码器（Eg3Head）保留边缘细节，并通过边缘引导特征融合模块（EgFFM）融合信息。

Result: 在Potsdam、Vaihingen和LoveDA数据集上分别达到88.57%、81.46%和53.55%的mIoU。

Conclusion: TEFormer有效提升了城市遥感图像语义分割的准确性。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of urban remote sensing images (URSIs) is crucial for
applications such as urban planning and environmental monitoring. However,
geospatial objects often exhibit subtle texture differences and similar spatial
structures, which can easily lead to semantic ambiguity and misclassification.
Moreover, challenges such as irregular object shapes, blurred boundaries, and
overlapping spatial distributions of semantic objects contribute to complex and
diverse edge morphologies, further complicating accurate segmentation. To
tackle these issues, we propose a texture-aware and edge-guided Transformer
(TEFormer) that integrates texture awareness and edge-guidance mechanisms for
semantic segmentation of URSIs. In the encoder, a texture-aware module (TaM) is
designed to capture fine-grained texture differences between visually similar
categories to enhance semantic discrimination. Then, an edge-guided tri-branch
decoder (Eg3Head) is constructed to preserve local edges and details for
multiscale context-awareness. Finally, an edge-guided feature fusion module
(EgFFM) is to fuse contextual and detail information with edge information to
realize refined semantic segmentation. Extensive experiments show that TEFormer
achieves mIoU of 88.57%, 81.46%, and 53.55% on the Potsdam, Vaihingen, and
LoveDA datasets, respectively, shows the effectiveness in URSI semantic
segmentation.

Abstract: Depth information is essential in computer vision, particularly in underwater
imaging, robotics, and autonomous navigation. However, conventional
augmentation techniques overlook depth aware transformations, limiting model
robustness in real world depth variations. In this paper, we introduce
Depth-Jitter, a novel depth-based augmentation technique that simulates natural
depth variations to improve generalization. Our approach applies adaptive depth
offsetting, guided by depth variance thresholds, to generate synthetic depth
perturbations while preserving structural integrity. We evaluate Depth-Jitter
on two benchmark datasets, FathomNet and UTDAC2020 demonstrating its impact on
model stability under diverse depth conditions. Extensive experiments compare
Depth-Jitter against traditional augmentation strategies such as ColorJitter,
analyzing performance across varying learning rates, encoders, and loss
functions. While Depth-Jitter does not always outperform conventional methods
in absolute performance, it consistently enhances model stability and
generalization in depth-sensitive environments. These findings highlight the
potential of depth-aware augmentation for real-world applications and provide a
foundation for further research into depth-based learning strategies. The
proposed technique is publicly available to support advancements in depth-aware
augmentation. The code is publicly available on

Result: 统一方法性能与专用模型相当，且在未见模糊场景中表现出强大的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为图像去模糊提供了一种高效、通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Image deblurring, removing blurring artifacts from images, is a fundamental
task in computational photography and low-level computer vision. Existing
approaches focus on specialized solutions tailored to particular blur types,
thus, these solutions lack generalization. This limitation in current methods
implies requiring multiple models to cover several blur types, which is not
practical in many real scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the first
all-in-one deblurring method capable of efficiently restoring images affected
by diverse blur degradations, including global motion, local motion, blur in
low-light conditions, and defocus blur. We propose a mixture-of-experts (MoE)
decoding module, which dynamically routes image features based on the
recognized blur degradation, enabling precise and efficient restoration in an
end-to-end manner. Our unified approach not only achieves performance
comparable to dedicated task-specific models, but also demonstrates remarkable
robustness and generalization capabilities on unseen blur degradation
scenarios.

Abstract: The generalization of deepfake detectors to unseen manipulation techniques
remains a challenge for practical deployment. Although many approaches adapt
foundation models by introducing significant architectural complexity, this
work demonstrates that robust generalization is achievable through a
parameter-efficient adaptation of a pre-trained CLIP vision encoder. The
proposed method, LNCLIP-DF, fine-tunes only the Layer Normalization parameters
(0.03% of the total) and enhances generalization by enforcing a hyperspherical
feature manifold using L2 normalization and latent space augmentations.
  We conducted an extensive evaluation on 13 benchmark datasets spanning from
2019 to 2025. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance,
outperforming more complex, recent approaches in average cross-dataset AUROC.
Our analysis yields two primary findings for the field: 1) training on paired
real-fake data from the same source video is essential for mitigating shortcut
learning and improving generalization, and 2) detection difficulty on academic
datasets has not strictly increased over time, with models trained on older,
diverse datasets showing strong generalization capabilities.
  This work delivers a computationally efficient and reproducible method,
proving that state-of-the-art generalization is attainable by making targeted,
minimal changes to a pre-trained CLIP model. The code will be made publicly
available upon acceptance.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为FedX的新策略，通过解释引导的剪枝减少联邦学习中的通信开销，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在遥感图像分类任务中面临通信开销大的挑战，数据集中化可能受法律和隐私限制。

Method: FedX利用反向传播解释方法评估模型组件的重要性，剪枝最不相关的部分以减少传输模型大小。

Result: 在BigEarthNet-S2和EuroSAT数据集上的实验表明，FedX显著减少了共享参数数量并提升了模型泛化能力。

Conclusion: FedX有效解决了联邦学习中的通信开销问题，优于现有剪枝方法。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables the collaborative training of deep neural
networks across decentralized data archives (i.e., clients), where each client
stores data locally and only shares model updates with a central server. This
makes FL a suitable learning paradigm for remote sensing (RS) image
classification tasks, where data centralization may be restricted due to legal
and privacy constraints. However, a key challenge in applying FL to RS tasks is
the communication overhead caused by the frequent exchange of large model
updates between clients and the central server. To address this issue, in this
paper we propose a novel strategy (denoted as FedX) that uses
explanation-guided pruning to reduce communication overhead by minimizing the
size of the transmitted models without compromising performance. FedX leverages
backpropagation-based explanation methods to estimate the task-specific
importance of model components and prunes the least relevant ones at the
central server. The resulting sparse global model is then sent to clients,
substantially reducing communication overhead. We evaluate FedX on multi-label
scene classification using the BigEarthNet-S2 dataset and single-label scene
classification using the EuroSAT dataset. Experimental results show the success
of FedX in significantly reducing the number of shared model parameters while
enhancing the generalization capability of the global model, compared to both
unpruned model and state-of-the-art pruning methods. The code of FedX will be

*Byunghyun Ko,Anning Tian,Jeongkyu Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为XAG-Net的2.5D U-Net架构，结合像素级跨切片注意力（CSA）和跳跃注意力门控（AG）机制，显著提升了股骨MRI分割的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有2D和3D深度学习方法在股骨MRI分割中存在局限性，影响骨科诊断和手术规划。

Method: 采用2.5D U-Net架构，引入像素级CSA和AG机制，优化切片间上下文建模和切片内特征细化。

Result: XAG-Net在分割精度上优于基线2D、2.5D和3D U-Net模型，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: XAG-Net通过CSA和AG模块的有效性，成为股骨MRI分割的高效准确框架。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of femur structures from Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(MRI) is critical for orthopedic diagnosis and surgical planning but remains
challenging due to the limitations of existing 2D and 3D deep learning-based
segmentation approaches. In this study, we propose XAG-Net, a novel 2.5D
U-Net-based architecture that incorporates pixel-wise cross-slice attention
(CSA) and skip attention gating (AG) mechanisms to enhance inter-slice
contextual modeling and intra-slice feature refinement. Unlike previous
CSA-based models, XAG-Net applies pixel-wise softmax attention across adjacent
slices at each spatial location for fine-grained inter-slice modeling.
Extensive evaluations demonstrate that XAG-Net surpasses baseline 2D, 2.5D, and
3D U-Net models in femur segmentation accuracy while maintaining computational
efficiency. Ablation studies further validate the critical role of the CSA and
AG modules, establishing XAG-Net as a promising framework for efficient and
accurate femur MRI segmentation.

*Jian Hu,Zixu Cheng,Shaogang Gong,Isabel Guan,Jianye Hao,Jun Wang,Kun Shao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种数据高效的跨域视频时序定位方法URPA，无需目标域标注，通过少量未标注视频实现跨域知识迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法GRPO依赖标注数据且计算开销大，难以在未标注域和实时场景中应用。

Method: 使用GRPO生成多个候选预测，通过平均形成伪标签，并利用方差估计置信度，加权训练奖励。

Result: 在三个数据集的六种跨域设置中表现良好，仅需少量未标注目标视频。

Conclusion: URPA是一种高效、实用的跨域视频时序定位方法，适用于实时部署。

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (TG) aims to temporally locate video segments
matching a natural language description (a query) in a long video. While
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are effective at holistic semantic matching, they
often struggle with fine-grained temporal localisation. Recently, Group
Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO) reformulates the inference process as a
reinforcement learning task, enabling fine-grained grounding and achieving
strong in-domain performance. However, GRPO relies on labelled data, making it
unsuitable in unlabelled domains. Moreover, because videos are large and
expensive to store and process, performing full-scale adaptation introduces
prohibitive latency and computational overhead, making it impractical for
real-time deployment. To overcome both problems, we introduce a Data-Efficient
Unlabelled Cross-domain Temporal Grounding method, from which a model is first
trained on a labelled source domain, then adapted to a target domain using only
a small number of unlabelled videos from the target domain. This approach
eliminates the need for target annotation and keeps both computational and
storage overhead low enough to run in real time. Specifically, we introduce.
Uncertainty-quantified Rollout Policy Adaptation (URPA) for cross-domain
knowledge transfer in learning video temporal grounding without target labels.
URPA generates multiple candidate predictions using GRPO rollouts, averages
them to form a pseudo label, and estimates confidence from the variance across
these rollouts. This confidence then weights the training rewards, guiding the
model to focus on reliable supervision. Experiments on three datasets across
six cross-domain settings show that URPA generalises well using only a few
unlabelled target videos. Codes will be released once published.

*Xin Ci Wong,Duygu Sarikaya,Kieran Zucker,Marc De Kamps,Nishant Ravikumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于扩散模型的方法，生成合成心脏MR图像以解决领域偏移问题，显著提升多中心分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决心脏MR图像因设备和协议差异导致的领域偏移问题，避免传统方法的局限性。

Method: 使用扩散模型生成合成图像，保持结构和空间一致性，并评估其在领域泛化和适应中的效果。

Result: 合成数据显著提升了分割性能（p < 0.01），优于仅使用真实数据的方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效减少了对迁移学习的需求，适用于数据稀缺场景。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, including cardiac MR, is prone to domain
shift due to variations in imaging devices and acquisition protocols. This
challenge limits the deployment of trained AI models in real-world scenarios,
where performance degrades on unseen domains. Traditional solutions involve
increasing the size of the dataset through ad-hoc image augmentation or
additional online training/transfer learning, which have several limitations.
Synthetic data offers a promising alternative, but anatomical/structural
consistency constraints limit the effectiveness of generative models in
creating image-label pairs. To address this, we propose a diffusion model (DM)
trained on a source domain that generates synthetic cardiac MR images that
resemble a given reference. The synthetic data maintains spatial and structural
fidelity, ensuring similarity to the source domain and compatibility with the
segmentation mask. We assess the utility of our generative approach in
multi-centre cardiac MR segmentation, using the 2D nnU-Net, 3D nnU-Net and
vanilla U-Net segmentation networks. We explore domain generalisation, where,
domain-invariant segmentation models are trained on synthetic source domain
data, and domain adaptation, where, we shift target domain data towards the
source domain using the DM. Both strategies significantly improved segmentation
performance on data from an unseen target domain, in terms of surface-based
metrics (Welch's t-test, p < 0.01), compared to training segmentation models on
real data alone. The proposed method ameliorates the need for transfer learning
or online training to address domain shift challenges in cardiac MR image
analysis, especially useful in data-scarce settings.

TL;DR: 改进ViPro模型，使其能够从观察中正确推断状态，无需初始真实状态，并在无监督方式下实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ViPro模型因依赖初始真实状态而无法处理噪声观察的问题。

Method: 在ViPro基础上增加改进，使其能无监督地从观察中推断状态，并扩展Orbits数据集为3D版本。

Result: 模型能够无监督地正确推断状态，且适用于更接近真实场景的3D数据。

Conclusion: 改进后的ViPro模型在无监督状态下表现更优，适用于更复杂的现实场景。

Abstract: Predicting future video frames is a challenging task with many downstream
applications. Previous work has shown that procedural knowledge enables deep
models for complex dynamical settings, however their model ViPro assumed a
given ground truth initial symbolic state. We show that this approach led to
the model learning a shortcut that does not actually connect the observed
environment with the predicted symbolic state, resulting in the inability to
estimate states given an observation if previous states are noisy. In this
work, we add several improvements to ViPro that enables the model to correctly
infer states from observations without providing a full ground truth state in
the beginning. We show that this is possible in an unsupervised manner, and
extend the original Orbits dataset with a 3D variant to close the gap to real
world scenarios.

*Kieran Elrod,Katherine Flanigan,Mario Bergés*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究利用街景图像和大型语言模型分析城市社交互动质量，发现其与城市环境和居民情感依恋相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注行人数量而非社交互动质量，街景图像作为低成本数据源可能蕴含潜在社交信息。

Method: 分析15个城市的2,998张街景图像，结合Mehta的社交分类理论，使用线性回归模型控制多种变量。

Result: 天空视野指数与所有社交类型相关，绿色视野指数预测持久社交，情感依恋与短暂社交正相关。

Conclusion: 街景图像可用于研究社交互动与城市环境的关系，为城市设计提供数据支持。

Abstract: Designing socially active streets has long been a goal of urban planning, yet
existing quantitative research largely measures pedestrian volume rather than
the quality of social interactions. We hypothesize that street view imagery --
an inexpensive data source with global coverage -- contains latent social
information that can be extracted and interpreted through established social
science theory. As a proof of concept, we analyzed 2,998 street view images
from 15 cities using a multimodal large language model guided by Mehta's
taxonomy of passive, fleeting, and enduring sociability -- one illustrative
example of a theory grounded in urban design that could be substituted or
complemented by other sociological frameworks. We then used linear regression
models, controlling for factors like weather, time of day, and pedestrian
counts, to test whether the inferred sociability measures correlate with
city-level place attachment scores from the World Values Survey and with
environmental predictors (e.g., green, sky, and water view indices) derived
from individual street view images. Results aligned with long-standing urban
planning theory: the sky view index was associated with all three sociability
types, the green view index predicted enduring sociability, and place
attachment was positively associated with fleeting sociability. These results
provide preliminary evidence that street view images can be used to infer
relationships between specific types of social interactions and built
environment variables. Further research could establish street view imagery as
a scalable, privacy-preserving tool for studying urban sociability, enabling
cross-cultural theory testing and evidence-based design of socially vibrant
cities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频理解模型在处理异常事件时表现不佳，主要因异常事件的空间和时间稀疏性导致冗余信息干扰。

Method: 提出VA-GPT模型，包含空间有效令牌选择（SETS）和时间有效令牌生成（TETG）模块，优化视觉与语言模型的对齐。

Result: 模型在多个基准测试中优于现有方法，表现更优。

Conclusion: VA-GPT通过有效令牌模块和专用数据集，显著提升了异常事件分析的准确性。

Abstract: Understanding abnormal events in videos is a vital and challenging task that
has garnered significant attention in a wide range of applications. Although
current video understanding Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are
capable of analyzing general videos, they often struggle to handle anomalies
due to the spatial and temporal sparsity of abnormal events, where the
redundant information always leads to suboptimal outcomes. To address these
challenges, exploiting the representation and generalization capabilities of
Vison Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose
VA-GPT, a novel MLLM designed for summarizing and localizing abnormal events in
various videos. Our approach efficiently aligns effective tokens between visual
encoders and LLMs through two key proposed modules: Spatial Effective Token
Selection (SETS) and Temporal Effective Token Generation (TETG). These modules
enable our model to effectively capture and analyze both spatial and temporal
information associated with abnormal events, resulting in more accurate
responses and interactions. Furthermore, we construct an instruction-following
dataset specifically for fine-tuning video-anomaly-aware MLLMs, and introduce a
cross-domain evaluation benchmark based on XD-Violence dataset. Our proposed
method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on various benchmarks.

Motivation: 将图像分割为前景和背景区域，假设像素值可由两个不同的平均值概括，且区域边界平滑。

Method: 改进Chan-Vese能量模型，引入分裂Bregman方法进行高效优化。

Result: 通过多组图像和参数测试，验证了算法的性能。

Conclusion: 该实现方法高效且适用于两阶段图像分割任务。

Abstract: In this paper, we describe an implementation of the two-phase image
segmentation algorithm proposed by Goldstein, Bresson, Osher in
\cite{gold:bre}. This algorithm partitions the domain of a given 2d image into
foreground and background regions, and each pixel of the image is assigned
membership to one of these two regions. The underlying assumption for the
segmentation model is that the pixel values of the input image can be
summarized by two distinct average values, and that the region boundaries are
smooth. Accordingly, the model is defined as an energy in which the variable is
a region membership function to assign pixels to either region, originally
proposed by Chan and Vese in \cite{chan:vese}. This energy is the sum of image
data terms in the regions and a length penalty for region boundaries.
Goldstein, Bresson, Osher modify the energy of Chan-Vese in \cite{gold:bre} so
that their new energy can be minimized efficiently using the split Bregman
method to produce an equivalent two-phase segmentation. We provide a detailed
implementation of this method \cite{gold:bre}, and document its performance
with several images over a range of algorithm parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖大量模态特定标注数据或仅适用于单一模态，TaAM-CPT旨在解决这一问题。

Method: TaAM-CPT结合模态提示池、文本构建和预训练模型的模态对齐文本编码器，设计跨模态学习目标。

Result: TaAM-CPT在视频、图像和音频分类等任务中表现领先，无需模态特定标注数据。

Conclusion: TaAM-CPT展示了在多模态任务中的高效性和可扩展性。

Abstract: The integration of prompt tuning with multimodal learning has shown
significant generalization abilities for various downstream tasks. Despite
advancements, existing methods heavily depend on massive modality-specific
labeled data (e.g., video, audio, and image), or are customized for a single
modality. In this study, we present Text as Any-Modality by Consistent Prompt
Tuning (TaAM-CPT), a scalable approach for constructing a general
representation model toward unlimited modalities using solely text data.
TaAM-CPT comprises modality prompt pools, text construction, and
modality-aligned text encoders from pre-trained models, which allows for
extending new modalities by simply adding prompt pools and modality-aligned
text encoders. To harmonize the learning across different modalities, TaAM-CPT
designs intra- and inter-modal learning objectives, which can capture category
details within modalities while maintaining semantic consistency across
different modalities. Benefiting from its scalable architecture and pre-trained
models, TaAM-CPT can be seamlessly extended to accommodate unlimited
modalities. Remarkably, without any modality-specific labeled data, TaAM-CPT
achieves leading results on diverse datasets spanning various modalities,
including video classification, image classification, and audio classification.

Result: 实验表明，FVGen在相同数量新视角下，视觉质量相似或更好，采样时间减少90%以上。

Conclusion: FVGen显著提升稀疏视图3D重建的时间效率，适用于需要多次运行VDMs的场景。

Abstract: Recent progress in 3D reconstruction has enabled realistic 3D models from
dense image captures, yet challenges persist with sparse views, often leading
to artifacts in unseen areas. Recent works leverage Video Diffusion Models
(VDMs) to generate dense observations, filling the gaps when only sparse views
are available for 3D reconstruction tasks. A significant limitation of these
methods is their slow sampling speed when using VDMs. In this paper, we present
FVGen, a novel framework that addresses this challenge by enabling fast novel
view synthesis using VDMs in as few as four sampling steps. We propose a novel
video diffusion model distillation method that distills a multi-step denoising
teacher model into a few-step denoising student model using Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) and softened reverse KL-divergence minimization.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that, compared to previous
works, our framework generates the same number of novel views with similar (or
even better) visual quality while reducing sampling time by more than 90%.
FVGen significantly improves time efficiency for downstream reconstruction
tasks, particularly when working with sparse input views (more than 2) where
pre-trained VDMs need to be run multiple times to achieve better spatial
coverage.

Abstract: SAR ship classification faces the challenge of long-tailed datasets, which
complicates the classification of underrepresented classes. Oversampling
methods have proven effective in addressing class imbalance in optical data. In
this paper, we evaluated the effect of oversampling in the feature space for
SAR ship classification. We propose two novel algorithms inspired by the

Additionally, we also analyzed the impact of oversampling methods on different
class sizes. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of our novel methods
over the original M2m and baselines, with an average F1-score increase of 8.82%
for FuSARShip and 4.44% for OpenSARShip.

Conclusion: TRUST通过语言模态引导和不确定性估计有效提升了复杂域偏移下的自适应性能。

Abstract: Recent unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods have shown great success
in addressing classical domain shifts (e.g., synthetic-to-real), but they still
suffer under complex shifts (e.g. geographical shift), where both the
background and object appearances differ significantly across domains. Prior
works showed that the language modality can help in the adaptation process,
exhibiting more robustness to such complex shifts. In this paper, we introduce
TRUST, a novel UDA approach that exploits the robustness of the language
modality to guide the adaptation of a vision model. TRUST generates
pseudo-labels for target samples from their captions and introduces a novel
uncertainty estimation strategy that uses normalised CLIP similarity scores to
estimate the uncertainty of the generated pseudo-labels. Such estimated
uncertainty is then used to reweight the classification loss, mitigating the
adverse effects of wrong pseudo-labels obtained from low-quality captions. To
further increase the robustness of the vision model, we propose a multimodal
soft-contrastive learning loss that aligns the vision and language feature
spaces, by leveraging captions to guide the contrastive training of the vision
model on target images. In our contrastive loss, each pair of images acts as
both a positive and a negative pair and their feature representations are
attracted and repulsed with a strength proportional to the similarity of their
captions. This solution avoids the need for hardly determining positive and
negative pairs, which is critical in the UDA setting. Our approach outperforms
previous methods, setting the new state-of-the-art on classical (DomainNet) and
complex (GeoNet) domain shifts. The code will be available upon acceptance.

Conclusion: LightSwitch通过整合内在属性和多视图数据，显著提升了重光照的效率和效果。

Abstract: Recent approaches for 3D relighting have shown promise in integrating 2D
image relighting generative priors to alter the appearance of a 3D
representation while preserving the underlying structure. Nevertheless,
generative priors used for 2D relighting that directly relight from an input
image do not take advantage of intrinsic properties of the subject that can be
inferred or cannot consider multi-view data at scale, leading to subpar
relighting. In this paper, we propose Lightswitch, a novel finetuned
material-relighting diffusion framework that efficiently relights an arbitrary
number of input images to a target lighting condition while incorporating cues
from inferred intrinsic properties. By using multi-view and material
information cues together with a scalable denoising scheme, our method
consistently and efficiently relights dense multi-view data of objects with
diverse material compositions. We show that our 2D relighting prediction
quality exceeds previous state-of-the-art relighting priors that directly
relight from images. We further demonstrate that LightSwitch matches or
outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion inverse rendering methods in relighting
synthetic and real objects in as little as 2 minutes.

Motivation: 现有方法仅使用单一图表示形式（TRF），无法适应不同模型或任务的需求，导致回答不准确或冗长。

Conclusion: DynamicTRF通过动态TRF选择和GRE指标，有效解决了现有方法的局限性，提升了图问答的准确性和简洁性。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown generalized zero-shot capabilities
in diverse domain question-answering (QA) tasks, including graph QA that
involves complex graph topologies. However, most current approaches use only a
single type of graph representation, namely Topology Representation Form (TRF),
such as prompt-unified text descriptions or style-fixed visual styles. Those
"one-size-fits-all" approaches fail to consider the specific preferences of
different models or tasks, often leading to incorrect or overly long responses.
To address this, we first analyze the characteristics and weaknesses of
existing TRFs, and then design a set of TRFs, denoted by $F_{ZS}$, tailored to
zero-shot graph QA. We then introduce a new metric, Graph Response Efficiency
(GRE), which measures the balance between the performance and the brevity in
graph QA. Built on these, we develop the DynamicTRF framework, which aims to
improve both the accuracy and conciseness of graph QA. To be specific,
DynamicTRF first creates a TRF Preference (TRFP) dataset that ranks TRFs based
on their GRE scores, to probe the question-specific TRF preferences. Then it
trains a TRF router on the TRFP dataset, to adaptively assign the best TRF from
$F_{ZS}$ for each question during the inference. Extensive experiments across 7
in-domain algorithmic graph QA tasks and 2 out-of-domain downstream tasks show
that DynamicTRF significantly enhances the zero-shot graph QA of LMMs in terms
of accuracy

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized content creation across
digital platforms, offering unprecedented capabilities in natural language
generation and understanding. These models enable beneficial applications such
as content generation, question and answering (Q&A), programming, and code
reasoning. Meanwhile, they also pose serious risks by inadvertently or
intentionally producing toxic, offensive, or biased content. This dual role of
LLMs, both as powerful tools for solving real-world problems and as potential
sources of harmful language, presents a pressing sociotechnical challenge. In
this survey, we systematically review recent studies spanning unintentional
toxicity, adversarial jailbreaking attacks, and content moderation techniques.
We propose a unified taxonomy of LLM-related harms and defenses, analyze
emerging multimodal and LLM-assisted jailbreak strategies, and assess
mitigation efforts, including reinforcement learning with human feedback
(RLHF), prompt engineering, and safety alignment. Our synthesis highlights the
evolving landscape of LLM safety, identifies limitations in current evaluation
methodologies, and outlines future research directions to guide the development
of robust and ethically aligned language technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs生成的对话常包含事实错误或虚构信息（幻觉），现有检测方法过于粗粒度，无法准确区分混合事实。

Method: 构建FineDialFact基准数据集，基于公开对话数据，验证原子事实，并测试多种基线方法，包括Chain-of-Thought推理。

Result: 实验显示Chain-of-Thought方法能提升性能，但在开放域对话数据集HybriDialogue上的最佳F1-score仅为0.75，表明任务仍具挑战性。

Conclusion: FineDialFact为未来研究提供了挑战性基准，数据集和代码将公开。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to produce hallucinations - factually
incorrect or fabricated information - which poses significant challenges for
many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, such as dialogue systems.
As a result, detecting hallucinations has become a critical area of research.
Current approaches to hallucination detection in dialogue systems primarily
focus on verifying the factual consistency of generated responses. However,
these responses often contain a mix of accurate, inaccurate or unverifiable
facts, making one factual label overly simplistic and coarse-grained. In this
paper, we introduce a benchmark, FineDialFact, for fine-grained dialogue fact
verification, which involves verifying atomic facts extracted from dialogue
responses. To support this, we construct a dataset based on publicly available
dialogue datasets and evaluate it using various baseline methods. Experimental
results demonstrate that methods incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning
can enhance performance in dialogue fact verification. Despite this, the best
F1-score achieved on the HybriDialogue, an open-domain dialogue dataset, is
only 0.75, indicating that the benchmark remains a challenging task for future
research. Our dataset and code will be public on GitHub.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了短暂记忆对语言学习的益处，发现其对提升语言模型性能有帮助，但对预测人类阅读时间有负面影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证认知科学中关于短暂记忆可能有助于语言学习的假设，并探讨Transformer模型在这一背景下的表现。

Method: 通过对比实验，训练带有和不带有短暂记忆的Transformer语言模型，使用发展性合理的训练集。

Result: 短暂记忆提升了语言学习性能（语言建模和句法评估），但降低了基于惊讶度的阅读时间预测准确性。

Conclusion: 短暂记忆对神经网络语言学习有益，但对行为预测无益，且与传统解释不符。

Abstract: Human memory is fleeting. As words are processed, the exact wordforms that
make up incoming sentences are rapidly lost. Cognitive scientists have long
believed that this limitation of memory may, paradoxically, help in learning
language - an idea supported by classic connectionist modelling work. The rise
of Transformers appears to challenge this idea, as these models can learn
language effectively, despite lacking memory limitations or other architectural
recency biases. Here, we investigate the hypothesized benefit of fleeting
memory for language learning in tightly controlled experiments on transformer
language models. Training transformers with and without fleeting memory on a
developmentally realistic training set, we find that fleeting memory
consistently improves language learning (as quantified by both overall language
modelling performance and targeted syntactic evaluation) but, unexpectedly,
impairs surprisal-based prediction of human reading times. Interestingly,
follow up analyses revealed that this discrepancy - better language modeling,
yet worse reading time prediction - could not be accounted for by prior
explanations of why better language models sometimes fit human reading time
worse. Together, these results support a benefit of memory limitations on
neural network language learning - but not on predicting behavior.

### [104] ["Mirror" Language AI Models of Depression are Criterion-Contaminated](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05830)
*Tong Li,Rasiq Hussain,Mehak Gupta,Joshua R. Oltmanns*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，基于语言的大模型（LLM）在预测抑郁评分时，直接使用与评估内容相似的语言（Mirror模型）会导致效应量虚高和泛化性降低，而使用非相似语言（Non-Mirror模型）虽然效应量较小，但更具泛化性和解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨Mirror模型因“标准污染”导致的效应量虚高问题，并比较其与非Mirror模型的性能差异，以提升语言AI模型在心理评估中的实用性。

Method: 使用GPT-4、GPT-4o和LLaMA3-70B分别基于结构化诊断访谈和生活史访谈的文本预测抑郁评分，比较Mirror模型和非Mirror模型的效应量和泛化性。

Result: Mirror模型效应量显著更高（R2 = .80），但与非Mirror模型（R2 = .27）在预测自报抑郁症状时表现相似（r = ~.54），表明Mirror模型存在偏差。主题建模揭示了模型间的差异。

Conclusion: Mirror模型因标准污染导致效应量虚高，泛化性较差；非Mirror模型更具实用性和解释性，未来研究应关注其在实际心理评估中的应用。

Abstract: A growing number of studies show near-perfect LLM language-based prediction
of depression assessment scores (up to R2 of .70). However, many develop these
models directly from language responses to depression assessments. These
"Mirror models" suffer from "criterion contamination", which arises when a
predicted score depends in part on the predictors themselves. This causes
artificial effect size inflation which reduces model generalizability. The
present study compares the performance of Mirror models versus "Non-Mirror
models", which are developed from language that does not mirror the assessment
they are developed to predict. N = 110 research participants completed two
different interviews: structured diagnostic and life history interviews. GPT-4,
GPT-4o and LLaMA3-70B were then prompted to predict structured diagnostic
interview depression scores from the two transcripts separately. Mirror models
(using structured diagnostic data) showed very large effect sizes (e.g., R2 =
.80). As expected, NonMirror models (using life history data) demonstrated
smaller effect sizes, but were relatively large (e.g., R2 = .27). When Mirror
and Non-Mirror model-predicted structured interview depression scores were
correlated with self-reported depression symptoms, Mirror and NonMirror
performed the same (e.g., r = ~.54), indicating that Mirror models contain bias
perhaps due to criterion contamination. Topic modeling identified clusters
across Mirror and Non-Mirror models, as well as between true-positive and
false-positive predictions. In this head-to-head comparison study, Mirror
language AI models of depression showed artificially inflated effect sizes and
less generalizability. As language AI models for depression continue to evolve,
incorporating Non-Mirror models may identify interpretable, and generalizable
semantic features that have unique utility in real-world psychological
assessment.

Motivation: 探索新兴通信中模拟自然语言屈折形态的可能性，以更贴近人类语言的特性。

Method: 通过小词汇约束模拟双重发音，设计新指标并探索连接性和融合性形态的游戏变体。

Result: 模拟音系约束促进连接形态，新兴语言倾向于融合语法属性。

Conclusion: 新兴语言在模拟自然语言特性方面表现出潜力，尤其是在屈折形态的模拟上。

Abstract: Emergent communication (EmCom) with deep neural network-based agents promises
to yield insights into the nature of human language, but remains focused
primarily on a few subfield-specific goals and metrics that prioritize
communication schemes which represent attributes with unique characters
one-to-one and compose them syntactically. We thus reinterpret a common EmCom
setting, the attribute-value reconstruction game, by imposing a
small-vocabulary constraint to simulate double articulation, and formulating a
novel setting analogous to naturalistic inflectional morphology (enabling
meaningful comparison to natural language communication schemes). We develop
new metrics and explore variations of this game motivated by real properties of
inflectional morphology: concatenativity and fusionality. Through our
experiments, we discover that simulated phonological constraints encourage
concatenative morphology, and emergent languages replicate the tendency of
natural languages to fuse grammatical attributes.

Abstract: Affective Computing has been established as a crucial field of inquiry to
advance the holistic development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems.
Foundation models -- especially Large Language Models (LLMs) -- have been
evaluated, trained, or instruction-tuned in several past works, to become
better predictors or generators of emotion. Most of these studies, however,
approach emotion-related tasks in a supervised manner, assessing or training
the capabilities of LLMs using discrete emotion labels associated with stimuli
(e.g., text, images, video, audio). Evaluation studies, in particular, have
often been limited to standard and superficial emotion-related tasks, such as
the recognition of evoked or expressed emotions. In this paper, we move beyond
surface-level emotion tasks to investigate how LLMs reason about emotions
through cognitive dimensions. Drawing from cognitive appraisal theory, we
examine whether LLMs produce coherent and plausible cognitive reasoning when
reasoning about emotionally charged stimuli. We introduce a large-scale
benchmark on Cognitive Reasoning for Emotions - CoRE - to evaluate internal
cognitive structures implicitly used by LLMs for emotional reasoning. Through a
plethora of evaluation experiments and analysis, we seek to answer: (a) Are
models more likely to implicitly rely on specific cognitive appraisal
dimensions?, (b) What cognitive dimensions are important for characterizing
specific emotions?, and, (c) Can the internal representations of different
emotion categories in LLMs be interpreted through cognitive appraisal
dimensions? Our results and analyses reveal diverse reasoning patterns across
different LLMs. Our benchmark and code will be made publicly available.

Motivation: 现有检索增强生成（RAG）方法难以分离检索的真实贡献，尤其是LLMs作为阅读器时对提示的敏感性。

Method: 引入Spectrum Projection Score（SPS）度量语义对齐，并开发xCompress框架动态压缩检索摘要。

Result: 在五个QA基准测试和四个开源LLMs上验证，SPS提升了任务性能并提供了理论视角。

Conclusion: SPS和xCompress为检索与生成的交互提供了新的评估和控制方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown improved generation performance
through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) following the retriever-reader
paradigm, which supplements model inputs with externally retrieved knowledge.
However, prior work often evaluates RAG holistically, assessing the retriever
and reader jointly, making it difficult to isolate the true contribution of
retrieval, particularly given the prompt sensitivity of LLMs used as readers.
We introduce Spectrum Projection Score (SPS), a lightweight, supervision-free
metric that allows the reader to gauge the semantic alignment of a retrieved
summary with its hidden representation by comparing the area formed by
generated tokens from the summary, and the principal directions of subspace in
the reader and to measure the relevance. Building on SPS we present xCompress,
an inference time controller framework that dynamically samples, ranks, and
compresses retrieval summary candidates. Extensive experiments on five QA
benchmarks with four open source LLMs show that SPS not only enhances
performance across a range of tasks but also provides a principled perspective
on the interaction between retrieval and generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 亲社会性文本检测缺乏明确定义和标注数据，需要新方法解决标注和部署问题。

Method: 三阶段流程：1) 基于少量人工标注数据确定最佳LLM标注策略；2) 人类-AI协作迭代优化任务定义；3) 训练两阶段推理系统，结合轻量级分类器和GPT-4。

Result: 系统减少了70%的推理成本，同时保持高精度（约0.90）。

Conclusion: 通过人类-AI协作、任务定义优化和部署感知设计，可为新型负责任AI任务提供可扩展解决方案。

Abstract: Detecting prosociality in text--communication intended to affirm, support, or
improve others' behavior--is a novel and increasingly important challenge for
trust and safety systems. Unlike toxic content detection, prosociality lacks
well-established definitions and labeled data, requiring new approaches to both
annotation and deployment. We present a practical, three-stage pipeline that
enables scalable, high-precision prosocial content classification while
minimizing human labeling effort and inference costs. First, we identify the
best LLM-based labeling strategy using a small seed set of human-labeled
examples. We then introduce a human-AI refinement loop, where annotators review
high-disagreement cases between GPT-4 and humans to iteratively clarify and
expand the task definition-a critical step for emerging annotation tasks like
prosociality. This process results in improved label quality and definition
alignment. Finally, we synthesize 10k high-quality labels using GPT-4 and train
a two-stage inference system: a lightweight classifier handles high-confidence
predictions, while only $\sim$35\% of ambiguous instances are escalated to
GPT-4o. This architecture reduces inference costs by $\sim$70% while achieving
high precision ($\sim$0.90). Our pipeline demonstrates how targeted human-AI
interaction, careful task formulation, and deployment-aware architecture design
can unlock scalable solutions for novel responsible AI tasks.

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注主题共享特征，忽略了主题特定特征，导致评分效果受限。

Method: ATOP通过优化可学习的主题感知提示（包含共享和特定组件），结合对抗训练和邻居分类器，生成目标主题的伪标签。

Result: 在ASAP++数据集上，ATOP显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ATOP通过结合主题共享和特定特征，有效提升了跨主题AES的性能。

Abstract: Cross-topic automated essay scoring (AES) aims to develop a transferable
model capable of effectively evaluating essays on a target topic. A significant
challenge in this domain arises from the inherent discrepancies between topics.
While existing methods predominantly focus on extracting topic-shared features
through distribution alignment of source and target topics, they often neglect
topic-specific features, limiting their ability to assess critical traits such
as topic adherence. To address this limitation, we propose an Adversarial
TOpic-aware Prompt-tuning (ATOP), a novel method that jointly learns
topic-shared and topic-specific features to improve cross-topic AES. ATOP
achieves this by optimizing a learnable topic-aware prompt--comprising both
shared and specific components--to elicit relevant knowledge from pre-trained
language models (PLMs). To enhance the robustness of topic-shared prompt
learning and mitigate feature scale sensitivity introduced by topic alignment,
we incorporate adversarial training within a unified regression and
classification framework. In addition, we employ a neighbor-based classifier to
model the local structure of essay representations and generate pseudo-labels
for target-topic essays. These pseudo-labels are then used to guide the
supervised learning of topic-specific prompts tailored to the target topic.
Extensive experiments on the publicly available ASAP++ dataset demonstrate that
ATOP significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both
holistic and multi-trait essay scoring. The implementation of our method is
publicly available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ATOP-A271.

Method: 在DistilBERT模型的注意力机制中引入结构化后处理稀疏性，并在SST-2任务上进行微调。

Result: 80%稀疏性的模型验证准确率为91.59%，比密集基线提高了0.97%。

Conclusion: 稀疏性不仅是提高计算效率的工具，还可能通过隐式正则化改善Transformer模型的泛化能力和性能。

Abstract: The quadratic computational cost of the self-attention mechanism is a primary
challenge in scaling Transformer models. While attention sparsity is widely
studied as a technique to improve computational efficiency, it is almost
universally assumed to come at the cost of model accuracy. In this paper, we
report a surprising counter-example to this common wisdom. By introducing
structured, post-hoc sparsity to the attention mechanism of a DistilBERT model
during fine-tuning on the SST-2 sentiment analysis task, we find that model
accuracy improves significantly. Our model with 80\% attention sparsity
achieves a validation accuracy of 91.59\%, a 0.97\% absolute improvement over
the dense baseline. We hypothesize that this phenomenon is due to sparsity
acting as a powerful implicit regularizer, preventing the model from
overfitting by forcing it to make predictions with a more constrained and
robust set of features. Our work recasts attention sparsity not just as a tool
for computational efficiency, but as a potential method for improving the
generalization and performance of Transformer models.

Motivation: 现有自奖励语言模型在同步改进选择和拒绝样本时，逐渐缩小了对比样本的表征差异，削弱了偏好学习的有效性。

Method: 提出了双阶段框架：(1) 锚定拒绝样本，固定过去初始模型的输出；(2) 未来引导选择样本，动态筛选未来模型的预测。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在相同计算资源下显著优于基线模型，例如Llama3.1-8B在AlpacaEval 2.0上的胜率提升9.75。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅在性能上优于基线，还在数学推理、知识问答和代码生成等任务中表现出更强的泛化能力。

Abstract: Self-Rewarding Language Models propose an architecture in which the Large
Language Models(LLMs) both generates responses and evaluates its own outputs
via LLM-as-a-Judge prompting, dynamically improving its generative capabilities
through iterative Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). However, our analysis
reveals a critical limitation in existing Self-Rewarding paradigms: the
synchronized improvement of chosen and rejected responses progressively narrows
the representational difference between contrasting samples, undermining
effective preference learning. We propose \textbf{Temporal Self-Rewarding
Language Models} that strategically coordinate past, present, and future model
generations to sustain learning signals. Our dual-phase framework introduces:
(1) \textit{Anchored Rejection} - fixing rejected responses using the past
initial model's outputs and (2) \textit{Future-Guided Chosen} - dynamically
curating chosen samples using next-generation model predictions. Extensive
experiments across three model families (Llama, Qwen, Mistral) and different
model sizes (Llama3B/8B/70B) demonstrate significant improvements when trained
with our method compared to Self-Rewarding using same computation resources.
For example, Llama3.1-8B reaches a 29.44 win rate on AlpacaEval 2.0 with our
method, outperforming the Self-Rewarding baseline (19.69) by 9.75. Notably, our
method also demonstrates superior out-of-distribution generalization across
mathematical reasoning (GSM8K), knowledge-based QA (ARC, TruthfulQA), and code
generation (HumanEval) tasks, even though we do not specifically collect such
training data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLM的随机性，难以预测其掌握的知识，而现有方法需要大量计算资源。

Method: 利用预训练的嵌入模型（如文本或图嵌入）作为代理，通过线性解码层预测LLM的知识。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型上的实验表明，嵌入模型预测LLM知识的准确率高达90%。

Conclusion: PEEK方法可大规模识别LLM的知识缺口，并揭示其内部归纳偏差。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) acquire knowledge across diverse domains such as
science, history, and geography encountered during generative pre-training.
However, due to their stochasticity, it is difficult to predict what LLMs have
acquired. Prior work has developed different ways to probe this knowledge by
investigating the hidden representations, crafting specific task prompts,
curating representative samples, and estimating their uncertainty. However,
these methods require making forward passes through the underlying model to
probe the LLM's knowledge about a specific fact, making them computationally
expensive and time-consuming. To bridge this gap, we propose $\textbf{PEEK}$ or
$\textbf{P}$roxy $\textbf{E}$mbeddings to $\textbf{E}$stimate
$\textbf{K}$nowledge of LLMs, by leveraging the pre-trained embedding models
that effectively encode factual knowledge as text or graphs as proxies for
LLMs. First, we identify a training set of facts known by LLMs through various
probing strategies and then adapt embedding models to predict the LLM outputs
with a linear decoder layer. Comprehensive evaluation on $3$ Wikipedia-derived
datasets, $4$ LLMs, and $7$ embedding models shows that embeddings can predict
LLM knowledge on a held-out set with up to 90 % accuracy. Furthermore, we find
that sentence embedding models are more suitable than graph embeddings to
predict LLM knowledge, shedding light on the underlying representation of the
factual landscape. Thus, we believe that knowledge-adapted embeddings can be
used to identify knowledge gaps in LLMs at scale and can provide deeper
insights into LLMs' internal inductive bias. The code and data are made
available at https://github.com/claws-lab/peek.

Result: 在StoryER、HANNA和OpenMEVA三个基准测试中达到SOTA性能，显著提升生成故事质量。

Conclusion: 自演化方法在故事评估和生成中表现出优越性。

Abstract: Although the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) as judges
(LLM-as-a-judge) has been validated, their performance remains limited in
open-ended tasks, particularly in story evaluation. Accurate story evaluation
is crucial not only for assisting human quality judgment but also for providing
key signals to guide story generation. However, existing methods face a
dilemma: prompt engineering for closed-source models suffers from poor
adaptability, while fine-tuning approaches for open-source models lack the
rigorous reasoning capabilities essential for story evaluation. To address
this, we propose the Self-Evolving Pairwise Reasoning (EvolvR) framework.
Grounded in pairwise comparison, the framework first self-synthesizes
score-aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data via a multi-persona strategy. To
ensure data quality, these raw CoTs undergo a self-filtering process, utilizing
multi-agents to guarantee their logical rigor and robustness. Finally, the
evaluator trained on the refined data is deployed as a reward model to guide
the story generation task. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on three evaluation benchmarks
including StoryER, HANNA and OpenMEVA. Furthermore, when served as a reward
model, it significantly enhances the quality of generated stories, thereby
fully validating the superiority of our self-evolving approach.

Abstract: Constructed languages (conlangs) such as Esperanto and Quenya have played
diverse roles in art, philosophy, and international communication. Meanwhile,
large-scale foundation models have revolutionized creative generation in text,
images, and beyond. In this work, we leverage modern LLMs as computational
creativity aids for end-to-end conlang creation. We introduce ConlangCrafter, a
multi-hop pipeline that decomposes language design into modular stages --
phonology, morphology, syntax, lexicon generation, and translation. At each
stage, our method leverages LLMs' meta-linguistic reasoning capabilities,
injecting randomness to encourage diversity and leveraging self-refinement
feedback to encourage consistency in the emerging language description. We
evaluate ConlangCrafter on metrics measuring coherence and typological
diversity, demonstrating its ability to produce coherent and varied conlangs

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决《古兰经》问答任务中因复杂语言、独特术语和深层含义带来的挑战。

Method: 1. 使用少样本提示和指令调优的大语言模型（如Gemini和DeepSeek）；2. 开发阿拉伯语提示框架；3. 结合子词对齐、重叠抑制和语义过滤的后处理系统。

Abstract: This paper presents two effective approaches for Extractive Question
Answering (QA) on the Quran. It addresses challenges related to complex
language, unique terminology, and deep meaning in the text. The second uses
few-shot prompting with instruction-tuned large language models such as Gemini
and DeepSeek. A specialized Arabic prompt framework is developed for span
extraction. A strong post-processing system integrates subword alignment,
overlap suppression, and semantic filtering. This improves precision and
reduces hallucinations. Evaluations show that large language models with Arabic
instructions outperform traditional fine-tuned models. The best configuration
achieves a pAP10 score of 0.637. The results confirm that prompt-based
instruction tuning is effective for low-resource, semantically rich QA tasks.

TL;DR: LogicRAG框架通过动态提取推理结构，避免预建图的高成本，显著提升检索效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有GraphRAG方法因预建图导致的高成本和低灵活性，以及无法适应多样化查询逻辑结构的问题。

Method: 动态分解查询为子问题，构建DAG表示逻辑依赖，通过拓扑排序线性化推理顺序，并应用图剪枝和上下文剪枝减少冗余。

Result: 实验表明LogicRAG在性能和效率上均优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: LogicRAG通过动态逻辑结构提取和自适应检索，有效解决了现有方法的局限性，提升了复杂任务的处理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often suffer from hallucination, generating
factually incorrect statements when handling questions beyond their knowledge
and perception. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses this by
retrieving query-relevant contexts from knowledge bases to support LLM
reasoning. Recent advances leverage pre-constructed graphs to capture the
relational connections among distributed documents, showing remarkable
performance in complex tasks. However, existing Graph-based RAG (GraphRAG)
methods rely on a costly process to transform the corpus into a graph,
introducing overwhelming token cost and update latency. Moreover, real-world
queries vary in type and complexity, requiring different logic structures for
accurate reasoning. The pre-built graph may not align with these required
structures, resulting in ineffective knowledge retrieval. To this end, we
propose a \textbf{\underline{Logic}}-aware
\textbf{\underline{R}}etrieval-\textbf{\underline{A}}ugmented
\textbf{\underline{G}}eneration framework (\textbf{LogicRAG}) that dynamically
extracts reasoning structures at inference time to guide adaptive retrieval
without any pre-built graph. LogicRAG begins by decomposing the input query
into a set of subproblems and constructing a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to
model the logical dependencies among them. To support coherent multi-step
reasoning, LogicRAG then linearizes the graph using topological sort, so that
subproblems can be addressed in a logically consistent order. Besides, LogicRAG
applies graph pruning to reduce redundant retrieval and uses context pruning to
filter irrelevant context, significantly reducing the overall token cost.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that LogicRAG achieves both superior
performance and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出AURA框架，通过多层Process Reward Models（PRMs）解决LLMs在逻辑推理中的安全风险，显著提升输出的逻辑完整性和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在逻辑推理中易忽略隐含的有害行为，传统安全方法缺乏细粒度和主动性。

Method: AURA结合自省式自我批判、细粒度PRM评估和自适应安全解码，动态引导模型推理。

Result: 实验证明AURA显著优于现有方法，提升逻辑完整性和安全性。

Conclusion: AURA为更安全、负责任的AI设定了新基准。

Abstract: Present day LLMs face the challenge of managing affordance-based safety
risks-situations where outputs inadvertently facilitate harmful actions due to
overlooked logical implications. Traditional safety solutions, such as scalar
outcome-based reward models, parameter tuning, or heuristic decoding
strategies, lack the granularity and proactive nature needed to reliably detect
and intervene during subtle yet crucial reasoning steps. Addressing this
fundamental gap, we introduce AURA, an innovative, multi-layered framework
centered around Process Reward Models (PRMs), providing comprehensive, step
level evaluations across logical coherence and safety-awareness. Our framework
seamlessly combines introspective self-critique, fine-grained PRM assessments,
and adaptive safety-aware decoding to dynamically and proactively guide models
toward safer reasoning trajectories. Empirical evidence clearly demonstrates
that this approach significantly surpasses existing methods, significantly
improving the logical integrity and affordance-sensitive safety of model
outputs. This research represents a pivotal step toward safer, more
responsible, and contextually aware AI, setting a new benchmark for
alignment-sensitive applications.

*Lingyuan Liu,Mengxiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为选择性反射蒸馏（SRD）的新框架，通过动态评估和选择高质量、兼容的训练数据，提升知识蒸馏（KD）的效果和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有白盒KD方法忽视了训练数据质量和学生模型兼容性，限制了蒸馏效果。

Method: SRD利用学生模型的反射系统性地优化训练数据，并通过课程调度策略逐步引入数据。

Result: 实验表明SRD能提升蒸馏模型性能，并减少高达39%的训练时间。

Conclusion: 数据质量和兼容性是KD的关键，SRD为高效压缩大语言模型提供了实用框架。

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a fundamental technique for compressing large
language models (LLMs) into compact, efficient student models. However,
existing white-box KD methods mainly focus on balancing ground truth and
student-generated responses while overlooking two critical factors: training
data quality and student-model compatibility. To address these limitations, we
propose Selective Reflection Distillation (SRD), a novel data curation
framework that leverages reflections from student models to systematically
refine training data. SRD dynamically evaluates and selects prompt-response
pairs by comparing ground truth data with student model outputs, selectively
curating high-quality, student-compatible training instances through automated
ranking based on difficulty. Furthermore, after selecting the training data, a
curriculum scheduling strategy is employed to incrementally introduce these
curated subsets into the distillation process at fixed intervals. As a
plug-and-play enhancement, SRD consistently improves distillation outcomes
across diverse white-box KD approaches and model architectures, as well as
decreases computational cost significantly during KD training. Experiments on a
range of language model benchmarks demonstrate SRD's consistent improvements in
distilled model performance, as well as a reduction in training runtime by up
to 39%, under diverse KD methods and model families. Notably, SRD operates as a
plug-and-play module, enhancing sample efficiency without modifying underlying
KD algorithms. Our findings highlight that data quality and compatibility are
pivotal to effective and efficient distillation of LLMs, and SRD provides a
principled framework to achieve both. This work advances the understanding of
data-centric factors in KD and offers practical insights for enhancing the
capability and efficiency of compressed LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型生成过程中可能出现的隐含刻板印象问题。

Method: 采用嵌套语义表示与上下文对比机制，通过注意力权重扰动分析模型对特定社会属性词的敏感性。

Result: 在多个刻板印象维度上表现出色，能准确识别语义相似文本间的偏见差异，同时保持高语义一致性和输出稳定性。

Conclusion: 该方法具有高可解释性，揭示了语言模型内部的偏见关联机制，为偏见检测提供了透明可靠的技术基础。

Abstract: This paper addresses the issue of implicit stereotypes that may arise during
the generation process of large language models. It proposes an interpretable
bias detection method aimed at identifying hidden social biases in model
outputs, especially those semantic tendencies that are not easily captured
through explicit linguistic features. The method combines nested semantic
representation with a contextual contrast mechanism. It extracts latent bias
features from the vector space structure of model outputs. Using attention
weight perturbation, it analyzes the model's sensitivity to specific social
attribute terms, thereby revealing the semantic pathways through which bias is
formed. To validate the effectiveness of the method, this study uses the
StereoSet dataset, which covers multiple stereotype dimensions including
gender, profession, religion, and race. The evaluation focuses on several key
metrics, such as bias detection accuracy, semantic consistency, and contextual
sensitivity. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves strong
detection performance across various dimensions. It can accurately identify
bias differences between semantically similar texts while maintaining high
semantic alignment and output stability. The method also demonstrates high
interpretability in its structural design. It helps uncover the internal bias
association mechanisms within language models. This provides a more transparent
and reliable technical foundation for bias detection. The approach is suitable
for real-world applications where high trustworthiness of generated content is
required.

TL;DR: TADrop是一种自适应稀疏化策略，通过为每个参数张量分配定制化的稀疏率，优化模型合并性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型合并方法采用统一的稀疏率，忽略了参数的结构和统计异质性，导致关键参数被误剪枝。

Method: TADrop根据参数张量的分布特性动态调整稀疏率，密集冗余的张量被大幅剪枝，稀疏关键的张量被保留。

Result: TADrop显著提升了多种任务和模型的性能，例如在8个ViT-B/32任务中平均性能提升2.0%。

Conclusion: TADrop通过自适应稀疏化有效减少参数干扰，为高性能模型合并提供了新基准。

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a compelling data-free paradigm for multi-task
learning, enabling the fusion of multiple fine-tuned models into a single,
powerful entity. A key technique in merging methods is sparsification, which
prunes redundant parameters from task vectors to mitigate interference.
However, prevailing approaches employ a ``one-size-fits-all'' strategy,
applying a uniform sparsity ratio that overlooks the inherent structural and
statistical heterogeneity of model parameters. This often leads to a suboptimal
trade-off, where critical parameters are inadvertently pruned while less useful
ones are retained. To address this limitation, we introduce \textbf{TADrop}
(\textbf{T}ensor-wise \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{Drop}), an adaptive
sparsification strategy that respects this heterogeneity. Instead of a global
ratio, TADrop assigns a tailored sparsity level to each parameter tensor based
on its distributional properties. The core intuition is that tensors with
denser, more redundant distributions can be pruned aggressively, while sparser,
more critical ones are preserved. As a simple and plug-and-play module, we
validate TADrop by integrating it with foundational, classic, and SOTA merging
methods. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks (vision, language, and
multimodal) and models (ViT, BEiT) demonstrate that TADrop consistently and
significantly boosts their performance. For instance, when enhancing a leading
merging method, it achieves an average performance gain of 2.0\% across 8
ViT-B/32 tasks. TADrop provides a more effective way to mitigate parameter
interference by tailoring sparsification to the model's structure, offering a
new baseline for high-performance model merging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法中RAG和RLVR能力孤立发展，限制了泛化性和应用范围，UR2旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出难度感知的课程训练和混合知识访问策略，结合离线语料库与LLM生成摘要。

Result: 在多个任务中表现优于现有方法，接近GPT-4o-mini和GPT-4.1-mini的性能。

Conclusion: UR2通过统一检索与推理，为LLM在多领域的应用提供了更灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities through two
complementary paradigms: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which enhances
knowledge grounding, and Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR),
which optimizes complex reasoning abilities. However, these two capabilities
are often developed in isolation, and existing efforts to unify them remain
narrow in scope-typically limited to open-domain QA with fixed retrieval
settings and task-specific assumptions. This lack of integration constrains
generalization and limits the applicability of RAG-RL methods to broader
domains. To bridge this gap, we propose UR2 (Unified RAG and Reasoning), a
general framework that unifies retrieval and reasoning through reinforcement
learning. UR2 introduces two key contributions: a difficulty-aware curriculum
training that selectively invokes retrieval only for challenging problems, and
a hybrid knowledge access strategy combining domain-specific offline corpora
with LLM-generated summaries. These components are designed to enable dynamic
coordination between retrieval and reasoning, improving adaptability across a
diverse range of tasks. Experiments across open-domain QA, MMLU-Pro, medical,
and mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that UR2 (built on Qwen2.5-3/7B
and LLaMA-3.1-8B) significantly outperforms existing RAG and RL methods,
achieving comparable performance to GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4.1-mini on several
benchmarks. We have released all code, models, and data at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在交流中的广泛应用，传统语用学理论（如Gricean理论）基于人类假设，不适用于机器为中心的LLMs，需重新思考。

Method: 论文分三部分：1. 挑战传统符号学三分法，提出人机通信框架；2. 对比人类中心与机器中心语用学，推荐概率语用学；3. 分析替代主义问题，提出语境挫折概念。

Result: 传统语用学需调整以适配生成式AI，概率语用学（如理性言语行为框架）更适用，同时需警惕人类偏见对LLM评估的影响。

Conclusion: 语用学理论需扩展以涵盖人机交互，强调用户与模型共同构建语用条件的重要性。

Abstract: The paper reconceptualizes pragmatics not as a subordinate, third dimension
of meaning, but as a dynamic interface through which language operates as a
socially embedded tool for action. With the emergence of large language models
(LLMs) in communicative contexts, this understanding needs to be further
refined and methodologically reconsidered. The first section challenges the
traditional semiotic trichotomy, arguing that connectionist LLM architectures
destabilize established hierarchies of meaning, and proposes the Human-Machine
Communication (HMC) framework as a more suitable alternative. The second
section examines the tension between human-centred pragmatic theories and the
machine-centred nature of LLMs. While traditional, Gricean-inspired pragmatics
continue to dominate, it relies on human-specific assumptions ill-suited to
predictive systems like LLMs. Probabilistic pragmatics, particularly the
Rational Speech Act framework, offers a more compatible teleology by focusing
on optimization rather than truth-evaluation. The third section addresses the
issue of substitutionalism in three forms - generalizing, linguistic, and
communicative - highlighting the anthropomorphic biases that distort LLM
evaluation and obscure the role of human communicative subjects. Finally, the
paper introduces the concept of context frustration to describe the paradox of
increased contextual input paired with a collapse in contextual understanding,
emphasizing how users are compelled to co-construct pragmatic conditions both
for the model and themselves. These arguments suggest that pragmatic theory may
need to be adjusted or expanded to better account for communication involving
generative AI.

Motivation: 解决LLM在少量数据下更新知识的挑战，并研究灾难性遗忘现象。

Method: 使用新闻数据集评估知识获取，探索不同数据增强算法生成合成数据，比较继续预训练和多样化提示的效果。

Conclusion: 通过多样化数据增强和自生成训练数据，可以优化LLM在少量数据下的知识注入，同时需平衡新知识学习和现有能力保留。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often require vast amounts of text to
effectively acquire new knowledge. While continuing pre-training on large
corpora or employing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has proven
successful, updating an LLM with only a few thousand or million tokens remains
challenging. In this work, we investigate the task of injecting small,
unstructured information into LLMs and its relation to the catastrophic
forgetting phenomenon. We use a dataset of recent news -- ensuring no overlap
with the model's pre-training data -- to evaluate the knowledge acquisition by
probing the model with question-answer pairs related the learned information.
Starting from a continued pre-training baseline, we explored different
augmentation algorithms to generate synthetic data to improve the knowledge
acquisition capabilities. Our experiments show that simply continuing
pre-training on limited data yields modest improvements, whereas exposing the
model to diverse textual variations significantly improves the learning of new
facts -- particularly with methods that induce greater variability through
diverse prompting. Furthermore, we shed light on the forgetting phenomenon in
small-data regimes, illustrating the delicate balance between learning new
content and retaining existing capabilities. We also confirm the sensitivity of
RAG-based approaches for knowledge injection, which often lead to greater
degradation on control datasets compared to parametric methods. Finally, we
demonstrate that models can generate effective synthetic training data
themselves, suggesting a pathway toward self-improving model updates. All code
and generated data used in our experiments are publicly available, providing a

Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）在自然语言理解方面取得了显著进展，但医疗领域的复杂性和数据异构性需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 结合动态知识图谱（DKG）与Grok 3模型，采用自适应语义融合算法（ASFA）处理异构医疗数据，动态生成和更新知识图谱。

Result: DKG-LLM在MIMIC-III和PubMed数据集上实现了84.19%的诊断准确率、89.63%的治疗推荐准确率和93.48%的语义覆盖率。

Conclusion: DKG-LLM是一种可靠且具有变革性的工具，能够处理噪声数据和复杂多症状疾病，并通过医生反馈进行学习。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have grown exponentially since the release of
ChatGPT. These models have gained attention due to their robust performance on
various tasks, including language processing tasks. These models achieve
understanding and comprehension of tasks by training billions of parameters.
The development of these models is a transformative force in enhancing natural
language understanding and has taken a significant step towards artificial
general intelligence (AGI). In this study, we aim to present the DKG-LLM
framework. The DKG-LLM framework introduces a groundbreaking approach to
medical diagnosis and personalized treatment recommendations by integrating a
dynamic knowledge graph (DKG) with the Grok 3 large language model. Using the
Adaptive Semantic Fusion Algorithm (ASFA), heterogeneous medical data
(including clinical reports and PubMed articles) and patient records
dynamically generate a knowledge graph consisting of 15,964 nodes in 13
distinct types (e.g., diseases, symptoms, treatments, patient profiles) and
127,392 edges in 26 relationship types (e.g., causal, therapeutic,
association). ASFA utilizes advanced probabilistic models, Bayesian inference,
and graph optimization to extract semantic information, dynamically updating
the graph with approximately 150 new nodes and edges in each data category
while maintaining scalability with up to 987,654 edges. Real-world datasets,
including MIMIC-III and PubMed, were utilized to evaluate the proposed
architecture. The evaluation results show that DKG-LLM achieves a diagnostic
accuracy of 84.19%. The model also has a treatment recommendation accuracy of
89.63% and a semantic coverage of 93.48%. DKG-LLM is a reliable and
transformative tool that handles noisy data and complex multi-symptom diseases,
along with feedback-based learning from physician input.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法采用二元分类或多维度统一标准，无法量化危害强度且存在场景不匹配问题。

Method: 提出场景自适应的多维度框架SceneJailEval，并构建包含14个场景的数据集。

Result: SceneJailEval在F1分数上表现优异（全场景0.917，JBB 0.995），超越现有方法。

Conclusion: SceneJailEval在越狱评估中具有显著优势，适用于多样化场景。

Abstract: Precise jailbreak evaluation is vital for LLM red teaming and jailbreak
research. Current approaches employ binary classification ( e.g., string
matching, toxic text classifiers, LLM-driven methods), yielding only "yes/no"
labels without quantifying harm intensity. Existing multi-dimensional
frameworks ( e.g., Security Violation, Relative Truthfulness, Informativeness)
apply uniform evaluation criteria across scenarios, resulting in
scenario-specific mismatches--for instance, "Relative Truthfulness" is
irrelevant to "hate speech"--which compromise evaluation precision. To tackle
these limitations, we introduce SceneJailEval, with key contributions: (1) A
groundbreaking scenario-adaptive multi-dimensional framework for jailbreak
evaluation, overcoming the critical "one-size-fits-all" constraint of existing
multi-dimensional methods, and featuring strong extensibility to flexibly adapt
to customized or emerging scenarios. (2) A comprehensive 14-scenario dataset
with diverse jailbreak variants and regional cases, filling the long-standing
gap in high-quality, holistic benchmarks for scenario-adaptive evaluation. (3)
SceneJailEval achieves state-of-the-art results, with an F1 score of 0.917 on
our full-scenario dataset (+6% over prior SOTA) and 0.995 on JBB (+3% over
prior SOTA), surpassing accuracy limits of existing evaluation methods in
heterogeneous scenarios and confirming its advantage.

Motivation: 情感智能（EI）在人类对齐的LLM发展中尚未充分探索，需要一种系统化的评估和提升方法。

Method: 提出四层EI分类法，设计EICAP-Bench基准测试，评估六种LLM，并通过LoRA适配器在UltraChat数据集上微调模型。

Result: Qwen2.5-Instruct表现最佳，但仅Appraisal层通过微调显著提升，其他层未见明显改进。

Conclusion: 现有预训练和指令调优方法在情感推理方面存在不足，需针对性数据和建模策略以实现全面EI对齐。

Abstract: Emotional Intelligence (EI) is a critical yet underexplored dimension in the
development of human-aligned LLMs. To address this gap, we introduce a unified,
psychologically grounded four-layer taxonomy of EI tailored for large language
models (LLMs), encompassing emotional tracking, cause inference, appraisal, and
emotionally appropriate response generation. Building on this framework, we
present EICAP-Bench, a novel MCQ style multi-turn benchmark designed to
evaluate EI capabilities in open-source LLMs across diverse linguistic and
cultural contexts. We evaluate six LLMs: LLaMA3 (8B), LLaMA3-Instruct, Gemma
(9B), Gemma-Instruct, Qwen2.5 (7B), and Qwen2.5-Instruct on EmoCap-Bench,
identifying Qwen2.5-Instruct as the strongest baseline. To assess the potential
for enhancing EI capabilities, we fine-tune both Qwen2.5-Base and
Qwen2.5-Instruct using LoRA adapters on UltraChat (UC), a large-scale,
instruction-tuned dialogue dataset, in both English and Arabic. Our statistical
analysis reveals that among the five EI layers, only the Appraisal layer shows
significant improvement through UC-based fine-tuning. These findings highlight
the limitations of existing pretraining and instruction-tuning paradigms in
equipping LLMs with deeper emotional reasoning and underscore the need for
targeted data and modeling strategies for comprehensive EI alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分类系统需要昂贵的重新训练来适应政策变化，而RAG方法通过动态检索知识实现快速适应。

Method: 提出Contextual Policy Engine（CPE），利用RAG将分类任务从基于预训练参数转向基于检索的上下文知识评估。

Result: CPE在仇恨言论检测中表现优异，支持动态政策更新且无需重新训练，同时提供解释性。

Conclusion: RAG方法使分类更灵活、透明、适应性强，适用于内容审核及其他分类问题。

Abstract: Robust content moderation requires classification systems that can quickly
adapt to evolving policies without costly retraining. We present classification
using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which shifts traditional
classification tasks from determining the correct category in accordance with
pre-trained parameters to evaluating content in relation to contextual
knowledge retrieved at inference. In hate speech detection, this transforms the
task from "is this hate speech?" to "does this violate the hate speech policy?"
  Our Contextual Policy Engine (CPE) - an agentic RAG system - demonstrates
this approach and offers three key advantages: (1) robust classification
accuracy comparable to leading commercial systems, (2) inherent explainability
via retrieved policy segments, and (3) dynamic policy updates without model
retraining. Through three experiments, we demonstrate strong baseline
performance and show that the system can apply fine-grained policy control by
correctly adjusting protection for specific identity groups without requiring
retraining or compromising overall performance. These findings establish that
RAG can transform classification into a more flexible, transparent, and
adaptable process for content moderation and wider classification problems.

*Keummin Ka,Junhyeong Park,Jahyun Jeon,Youngjae Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: InfoCausalQA是一个新的基准测试，用于评估基于信息图的多模态因果推理能力，发现当前视觉语言模型在计算和语义因果推理上表现有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索视觉语言模型在因果推理方面的能力，填补多模态环境中因果推理研究的空白。

Method: 设计了包含定量和语义因果推理任务的InfoCausalQA基准，收集494对信息图-文本数据，并生成1,482个高质量选择题对。

Result: 当前视觉语言模型在计算和语义因果推理上表现较差，与人类能力差距显著。

Conclusion: InfoCausalQA揭示了多模态AI系统在因果推理能力上的不足，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in perception and reasoning. However, the ability to perform
causal inference -- a core aspect of human cognition -- remains underexplored,
particularly in multimodal settings. In this study, we introduce InfoCausalQA,
a novel benchmark designed to evaluate causal reasoning grounded in
infographics that combine structured visual data with textual context. The
benchmark comprises two tasks: Task 1 focuses on quantitative causal reasoning
based on inferred numerical trends, while Task 2 targets semantic causal
reasoning involving five types of causal relations: cause, effect,
intervention, counterfactual, and temporal. We manually collected 494
infographic-text pairs from four public sources and used GPT-4o to generate
1,482 high-quality multiple-choice QA pairs. These questions were then
carefully revised by humans to ensure they cannot be answered based on
surface-level cues alone but instead require genuine visual grounding. Our
experimental results reveal that current VLMs exhibit limited capability in
computational reasoning and even more pronounced limitations in semantic causal
reasoning. Their significantly lower performance compared to humans indicates a
substantial gap in leveraging infographic-based information for causal
inference. Through InfoCausalQA, we highlight the need for advancing the causal
reasoning abilities of multimodal AI systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合Whisper ASR模型和Transformer语言模型的新方法，用于识别德语老年用户的语音意图，并通过合成数据提升了分类性能和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音意图识别方法多针对英语和短命令，本文旨在解决德语老年用户的长语音意图识别问题。

Method: 结合微调的Whisper ASR模型和基于Transformer的语言模型，利用LLM（LeoLM、Llama3、ChatGPT）生成的合成文本数据进行训练。

Result: 合成数据显著提升了分类性能和鲁棒性，且较小的LeoLM在德语意图识别中表现优于更大的ChatGPT。

Conclusion: 生成式AI可有效填补低资源领域的数据缺口，方法透明且可复现。

Abstract: Intent recognition (IR) for speech commands is essential for artificial
intelligence (AI) assistant systems; however, most existing approaches are
limited to short commands and are predominantly developed for English. This
paper addresses these limitations by focusing on IR from speech by elderly
German speakers. We propose a novel approach that combines an adapted Whisper
ASR model, fine-tuned on elderly German speech (SVC-de), with Transformer-based
language models trained on synthetic text datasets generated by three
well-known large language models (LLMs): LeoLM, Llama3, and ChatGPT. To
evaluate the robustness of our approach, we generate synthetic speech with a
text-to-speech model and conduct extensive cross-dataset testing. Our results
show that synthetic LLM-generated data significantly boosts classification
performance and robustness to different speaking styles and unseen vocabulary.
Notably, we find that LeoLM, a smaller, domain-specific 13B LLM, surpasses the
much larger ChatGPT (175B) in dataset quality for German intent recognition.
Our approach demonstrates that generative AI can effectively bridge data gaps
in low-resource domains. We provide detailed documentation of our data
generation and training process to ensure transparency and reproducibility.

*Ruichong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MDIR的新方法，用于检测大型语言模型（LLM）中的抄袭行为，解决了现有方法在权重对应重建、统计显著性计算和误报方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来，大型语言模型（LLM）中的知识产权（IP）问题日益突出，现有抄袭检测方法存在权重重建不准确、缺乏统计显著性计算等问题。

Method: MDIR利用矩阵分析和大偏差理论，无需完整模型推理即可准确重建权重关系并提供严格的p值估计。

Result: 实验表明，MDIR能可靠检测经过随机排列和持续预训练等复杂变换的抄袭行为，且检测过程高效（单台PC一小时内完成）。

Conclusion: MDIR是一种高效、准确的LLM抄袭检测方法，解决了现有技术的局限性。

Abstract: In recent years, concerns about intellectual property (IP) in large language
models (LLMs) have grown significantly. Plagiarizing other LLMs (through direct
weight copying, upcycling, pruning, or continual pretraining) and claiming
authorship without properly attributing to the original license, is a serious
misconduct that can lead to significant financial and reputational harm to the
original developers. However, existing methods for detecting LLM plagiarism
fall short in key areas. They fail to accurately reconstruct weight
correspondences, lack the ability to compute statistical significance measures
such as $p$-values, and may mistakenly flag models trained on similar data as
being related. To address these limitations, we propose Matrix-Driven Instant
Review (MDIR), a novel method that leverages matrix analysis and Large
Deviation Theory. MDIR achieves accurate reconstruction of weight
relationships, provides rigorous $p$-value estimation, and focuses exclusively
on weight similarity without requiring full model inference. Experimental
results demonstrate that MDIR reliably detects plagiarism even after extensive
transformations, such as random permutations and continual pretraining with
trillions of tokens. Moreover, all detections can be performed on a single PC
within an hour, making MDIR both efficient and accessible.

Motivation: 社交媒体网络欺凌检测因表达方式多样且隐蔽而具有挑战性，研究旨在探索辅助任务（如攻击性检测）对提升模型性能的作用。

Method: 采用指令调优的大语言模型，在五个攻击性数据集和一个网络欺凌数据集上评估了零样本、少样本、独立LoRA微调和多任务学习策略，并提出基于攻击性预测的增强提示方法。

Result: 增强提示方法在性能上优于标准LoRA微调，表明攻击性信息能显著提升网络欺凌检测效果。

Conclusion: 辅助任务（如攻击性检测）可有效提升大语言模型在安全关键应用中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Detecting cyberbullying on social media remains a critical challenge due to
its subtle and varied expressions. This study investigates whether integrating
aggression detection as an auxiliary task within a unified training framework
can enhance the generalisation and performance of large language models (LLMs)
in cyberbullying detection. Experiments are conducted on five aggression
datasets and one cyberbullying dataset using instruction-tuned LLMs. We
evaluated multiple strategies: zero-shot, few-shot, independent LoRA
fine-tuning, and multi-task learning (MTL). Given the inconsistent results of
MTL, we propose an enriched prompt pipeline approach in which aggression
predictions are embedded into cyberbullying detection prompts to provide
contextual augmentation. Preliminary results show that the enriched prompt
pipeline consistently outperforms standard LoRA fine-tuning, indicating that
aggression-informed context significantly boosts cyberbullying detection. This
study highlights the potential of auxiliary tasks, such as aggression
detection, to improve the generalisation of LLMs for safety-critical
applications on social networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补LLMs在情感支持与角色扮演结合方面的研究空白，以动漫角色为案例研究。

Method: 选择20个动漫角色，设计60个情感场景问题，收集40名动漫爱好者的对话数据，评估10个LLMs的表现。

Result: 表现最佳的LLMs在角色扮演和情感支持上超越人类，但人类在回答多样性上更优。

Conclusion: ChatAnime为优化LLMs在情感支持角色扮演中的研究提供了宝贵资源和见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
role-playing conversations and providing emotional support as separate research
directions. However, there remains a significant research gap in combining
these capabilities to enable emotionally supportive interactions with virtual
characters. To address this research gap, we focus on anime characters as a
case study because of their well-defined personalities and large fan bases.
This choice enables us to effectively evaluate how well LLMs can provide
emotional support while maintaining specific character traits. We introduce
ChatAnime, the first Emotionally Supportive Role-Playing (ESRP) dataset. We
first thoughtfully select 20 top-tier characters from popular anime communities
and design 60 emotion-centric real-world scenario questions. Then, we execute a
nationwide selection process to identify 40 Chinese anime enthusiasts with
profound knowledge of specific characters and extensive experience in
role-playing. Next, we systematically collect two rounds of dialogue data from
10 LLMs and these 40 Chinese anime enthusiasts. To evaluate the ESRP
performance of LLMs, we design a user experience-oriented evaluation system
featuring 9 fine-grained metrics across three dimensions: basic dialogue,
role-playing and emotional support, along with an overall metric for response
diversity. In total, the dataset comprises 2,400 human-written and 24,000
LLM-generated answers, supported by over 132,000 human annotations.
Experimental results show that top-performing LLMs surpass human fans in
role-playing and emotional support, while humans still lead in response
diversity. We hope this work can provide valuable resources and insights for
future research on optimizing LLMs in ESRP. Our datasets are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MCP协议因动态聚合实时数据而存在安全和隐私风险，现有防御方法不足。

Method: SecMCP利用潜在多面体空间建模LLM激活向量，检测对话动态异常。

Result: 在多个LLMs和数据集上验证，AUROC得分超过0.915，系统实用性良好。

Conclusion: SecMCP有效解决了MCP的安全威胁，并提供了新的量化方法。

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
integrating external tools, enabling dynamic aggregation of real-time data to
improve task execution. However, its non-isolated execution context introduces
critical security and privacy risks. In particular, adversarially crafted
content can induce tool poisoning or indirect prompt injection, leading to
conversation hijacking, misinformation propagation, or data exfiltration.
Existing defenses, such as rule-based filters or LLM-driven detection, remain
inadequate due to their reliance on static signatures, computational
inefficiency, and inability to quantify conversational hijacking. To address
these limitations, we propose SecMCP, a secure framework that detects and
quantifies conversation drift, deviations in latent space trajectories induced
by adversarial external knowledge. By modeling LLM activation vectors within a
latent polytope space, SecMCP identifies anomalous shifts in conversational
dynamics, enabling proactive detection of hijacking, misleading, and data
exfiltration. We evaluate SecMCP on three state-of-the-art LLMs (Llama3,
Vicuna, Mistral) across benchmark datasets (MS MARCO, HotpotQA, FinQA),
demonstrating robust detection with AUROC scores exceeding 0.915 while
maintaining system usability. Our contributions include a systematic
categorization of MCP security threats, a novel latent polytope-based
methodology for quantifying conversation drift, and empirical validation of
SecMCP's efficacy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代理的程序记忆脆弱且依赖人工设计或静态参数，需要一种可学习、可更新的记忆机制。

Method: 提出Memp方法，将代理轨迹转化为细粒度指令和高级抽象，并研究构建、检索和更新策略。

Result: 实验表明，随着记忆库优化，代理任务成功率和效率提升；强模型构建的记忆迁移至弱模型仍有效。

Conclusion: Memp方法通过动态更新记忆库，显著提升代理性能，且记忆迁移性强。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) based agents excel at diverse tasks, yet they
suffer from brittle procedural memory that is manually engineered or entangled
in static parameters. In this work, we investigate strategies to endow agents
with a learnable, updatable, and lifelong procedural memory. We propose Memp
that distills past agent trajectories into both fine-grained, step-by-step
instructions and higher-level, script-like abstractions, and explore the impact
of different strategies for Build, Retrieval, and Update of procedural memory.
Coupled with a dynamic regimen that continuously updates, corrects, and
deprecates its contents, this repository evolves in lockstep with new
experience. Empirical evaluation on TravelPlanner and ALFWorld shows that as
the memory repository is refined, agents achieve steadily higher success rates
and greater efficiency on analogous tasks. Moreover, procedural memory built
from a stronger model retains its value: migrating the procedural memory to a
weaker model yields substantial performance gains.

Conclusion: 跨语言能力无需大量多语言训练，轻量干预可纠正偏见，开源模型高效低成本。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are transforming social-science research by
enabling scalable, precise analysis. Their adaptability raises the question of
whether knowledge acquired through fine-tuning in a few languages can transfer
to unseen languages that only appeared during pre-training. To examine this, we
fine-tune lightweight LLaMA 3.2-3B models on monolingual, bilingual, or
multilingual data sets to classify immigration-related tweets from X/Twitter
across 13 languages, a domain characterised by polarised, culturally specific
discourse. We evaluate whether minimal language-specific fine-tuning enables
cross-lingual topic detection and whether adding targeted languages corrects
pre-training biases. Results show that LLMs fine-tuned in one or two languages
can reliably classify immigration-related content in unseen languages. However,
identifying whether a tweet expresses a pro- or anti-immigration stance
benefits from multilingual fine-tuning. Pre-training bias favours dominant
languages, but even minimal exposure to under-represented languages during
fine-tuning (as little as $9.62\times10^{-11}$ of the original pre-training
token volume) yields significant gains. These findings challenge the assumption
that cross-lingual mastery requires extensive multilingual training: limited
language coverage suffices for topic-level generalisation, and structural
biases can be corrected with lightweight interventions. By releasing
4-bit-quantised, LoRA fine-tuned models, we provide an open-source,
reproducible alternative to proprietary LLMs that delivers 35 times faster
inference at just 0.00000989% of the dollar cost of the OpenAI GPT-4o model,
enabling scalable, inclusive research.

media, in various media formats. Using three advanced AI-text detectors (e.g.,
Binoculars, Fast-Detect GPT, and GPTZero), we find substantial increase of
GenAI use in recent years, especially in local and college news. Sentence-level
analysis reveals LLMs are often used in the introduction of news, while
conclusions usually written manually. Linguistic analysis shows GenAI boosts
word richness and readability but lowers formality, leading to more uniform
writing styles, particularly in local media.

Motivation: 长上下文推理对LLM计算需求高，现有方法仍处理全部隐藏状态，效率有限。

Method: 提出SlimInfer框架，基于信息扩散现象动态剪枝中间层冗余令牌，并异步管理KV缓存。

Result: 实验显示，SlimInfer在LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct上实现2.53倍TTFT加速和1.88倍端到端延迟降低。

Conclusion: SlimInfer在不牺牲性能的前提下显著提升LLM推理效率。

Abstract: Long-context inference for Large Language Models (LLMs) is heavily limited by
high computational demands. While several existing methods optimize attention
computation, they still process the full set of hidden states at each layer,
limiting overall efficiency. In this work, we propose SlimInfer, an innovative
framework that aims to accelerate inference by directly pruning less critical
prompt tokens during the forward pass. Our key insight is an information
diffusion phenomenon: As information from critical tokens propagates through
layers, it becomes distributed across the entire sequence. This diffusion
process suggests that LLMs can maintain their semantic integrity when excessive
tokens, even including these critical ones, are pruned in hidden states.
Motivated by this, SlimInfer introduces a dynamic fine-grained pruning
mechanism that accurately removes redundant tokens of hidden state at
intermediate layers. This layer-wise pruning naturally enables an asynchronous
KV cache manager that prefetches required token blocks without complex
predictors, reducing both memory usage and I/O costs. Extensive experiments
show that SlimInfer can achieve up to $\mathbf{2.53\times}$ time-to-first-token
(TTFT) speedup and $\mathbf{1.88\times}$ end-to-end latency reduction for
LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct on a single RTX 4090, without sacrificing performance on
LongBench. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 触觉信号在多模态研究中较少被探索，而其在虚拟现实、无障碍和康复应用中具有潜力。

Method: 提出HapticLLaMA模型，结合频率和EnCodec两种触觉分词器，通过LLaMA架构和RLHF两阶段训练。

Result: 模型在METEOR和BLEU-4评分中表现优异，61%的生成描述获人类评分超过3.5（7分制），RLHF提升10%评分分布。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在适应和处理感官数据方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Haptic captioning is the task of generating natural language descriptions
from haptic signals, such as vibrations, for use in virtual reality,
accessibility, and rehabilitation applications. While previous multimodal
research has focused primarily on vision and audio, haptic signals for the
sense of touch remain underexplored. To address this gap, we formalize the
haptic captioning task and propose HapticLLaMA, a multimodal sensory language
model that interprets vibration signals into descriptions in a given sensory,
emotional, or associative category. We investigate two types of haptic
tokenizers, a frequency-based tokenizer and an EnCodec-based tokenizer, that
convert haptic signals into sequences of discrete units, enabling their
integration with the LLaMA model. HapticLLaMA is trained in two stages: (1)
supervised fine-tuning using the LLaMA architecture with LoRA-based adaptation,
and (2) fine-tuning via reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). We
assess HapticLLaMA's captioning performance using both automated n-gram metrics
and human evaluation. HapticLLaMA demonstrates strong capability in
interpreting haptic vibration signals, achieving a METEOR score of 59.98 and a
BLEU-4 score of 32.06 respectively. Additionally, over 61% of the generated
captions received human ratings above 3.5 on a 7-point scale, with RLHF
yielding a 10% improvement in the overall rating distribution, indicating
stronger alignment with human haptic perception. These findings highlight the
potential of large language models to process and adapt to sensory data.

Method: 采用后训练过程，通过启发式识别的约定形成示例进行微调，并设计两个新基准（交互任务和文档任务）评估。

Result: 实验表明，后训练的LLMs在两种评估方法中显著提升了约定形成能力。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了LLMs在多轮交互中的适应性，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Humans communicate with increasing efficiency in multi-turn interactions, by
adapting their language and forming ad-hoc conventions. In contrast, prior work
shows that LLMs do not naturally show this behavior. We develop a post-training
process to develop this ability through targeted fine-tuning on heuristically
identified demonstrations of convention formation. We evaluate with two new
benchmarks focused on this capability. First, we design a focused,
cognitively-motivated interaction benchmark that consistently elicits strong
convention formation trends in humans. Second, we create a new
document-grounded reference completion task that reflects in-the-wild
convention formation behavior. Our studies show significantly improved
convention formation abilities in post-trained LLMs across the two evaluation
methods.

### [143] [DogFit: Domain-guided Fine-tuning for Efficient Transfer Learning of Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05685)
*Yara Bahram,Mohammadhadi Shateri,Eric Granger*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: DogFit方法通过领域感知的微调机制，在扩散模型迁移学习中实现可控性，同时减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决扩散模型在迁移学习中小目标域上微调效果差的问题，同时避免高计算成本。

Method: 提出Domain-guided Fine-tuning (DogFit)，在训练损失中注入领域感知的引导偏移，并通过轻量级条件机制编码引导强度。

Result: 在多个目标域上，DogFit在FID和FDDINOV2指标上优于现有方法，且计算开销更低。

Conclusion: DogFit是一种高效且可控的扩散模型迁移学习方法，显著提升生成质量和训练稳定性。

Abstract: Transfer learning of diffusion models to smaller target domains is
challenging, as naively fine-tuning the model often results in poor
generalization. Test-time guidance methods help mitigate this by offering
controllable improvements in image fidelity through a trade-off with sample
diversity. However, this benefit comes at a high computational cost, typically
requiring dual forward passes during sampling. We propose the Domain-guided
Fine-tuning (DogFit) method, an effective guidance mechanism for diffusion
transfer learning that maintains controllability without incurring additional
computational overhead. DogFit injects a domain-aware guidance offset into the
training loss, effectively internalizing the guided behavior during the
fine-tuning process. The domain-aware design is motivated by our observation
that during fine-tuning, the unconditional source model offers a stronger
marginal estimate than the target model. To support efficient controllable
fidelity-diversity trade-offs at inference, we encode the guidance strength
value as an additional model input through a lightweight conditioning
mechanism. We further investigate the optimal placement and timing of the
guidance offset during training and propose two simple scheduling strategies,
i.e., late-start and cut-off, which improve generation quality and training
stability. Experiments on DiT and SiT backbones across six diverse target
domains show that DogFit can outperform prior guidance methods in transfer
learning in terms of FID and FDDINOV2 while requiring up to 2x fewer sampling
TFLOPS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要在实际设备上进行实验，耗时且成本高；现有模拟方法也存在测量时间长的问题。

Method: 在虚拟环境中模拟草基显示器的颜色变化特性，并通过多视角和多环境验证其准确性。

Result: 模拟结果与实际特性相似，且速度更快，准确性与前人研究相当。

Conclusion: 该方法为草基显示器的开发提供了一种高效且准确的模拟工具。

Abstract: Recent research has focused on incorporating media into living environments
via color-controlled materials and image display. In particular, grass-based
displays have drawn attention as landscape-friendly interactive interfaces. To
develop the grass display, it is important to obtain the grass color change
characteristics that depend on the real environment. However, conventional
methods require experiments on actual equipment every time the lighting or
viewpoint changes, which is time-consuming and costly. Although research has
begun on simulating grass colors, this approach still faces significant issues
as it takes many hours for a single measurement. In this paper, we explore an
interactive simulation of a grass display color change characteristic based on
real-world conditions in a virtual environment. We evaluated our method's
accuracy by simulating grass color characteristics across multiple viewpoints
and environments, and then compared the results against prior work. The results
indicated that our method tended to simulate the grass color characteristics
similar to the actual characteristics and showed the potential to do so more
quickly and with comparable accuracy to the previous study.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自适应探索策略优化（AEPO）框架，通过多答案生成策略和理论驱动的自适应探索奖励函数（AER），解决了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在GUI操作中语义对齐的探索瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在GUI操作中面临语义对齐的挑战，尤其是探索效率低下导致难以学习复杂的语义关联。

Method: 提出AEPO框架，结合多答案生成策略和理论驱动的AER函数，优化探索过程。

Result: AEPO训练的模型（InfiGUI-G1-3B和InfiGUI-G1-7B）在多个GUI基准测试中取得新SOTA，相对基线提升高达9.0%。

Conclusion: AEPO有效解决了语义对齐的探索瓶颈，显著提升了MLLMs在GUI操作中的性能。

Abstract: The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has propelled the
development of autonomous agents that operate on Graphical User Interfaces
(GUIs) using pure visual input. A fundamental challenge is robustly grounding
natural language instructions. This requires a precise spatial alignment, which
accurately locates the coordinates of each element, and, more critically, a
correct semantic alignment, which matches the instructions to the functionally
appropriate UI element. Although Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards
(RLVR) has proven to be effective at improving spatial alignment for these
MLLMs, we find that inefficient exploration bottlenecks semantic alignment,
which prevent models from learning difficult semantic associations. To address
this exploration problem, we present Adaptive Exploration Policy Optimization
(AEPO), a new policy optimization framework. AEPO employs a multi-answer
generation strategy to enforce broader exploration, which is then guided by a
theoretically grounded Adaptive Exploration Reward (AER) function derived from
first principles of efficiency eta=U/C. Our AEPO-trained models, InfiGUI-G1-3B
and InfiGUI-G1-7B, establish new state-of-the-art results across multiple
challenging GUI grounding benchmarks, achieving significant relative
improvements of up to 9.0% against the naive RLVR baseline on benchmarks
designed to test generalization and semantic understanding. Resources are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI安全方法（如事后可解释性和奖励工程）存在根本性局限，需将安全性融入系统核心设计。

Method: 采用透明信念表示和分层价值对齐的架构，利用自然语言表示和操作信念，实现多智能体系统自组织。

Result: 提出具体安全机制，如信念与偏好的自然语言分离、资源感知的自由能最小化、模块化智能体结构等。

Conclusion: 该框架为AGI开发提供了一条更安全的新路径，并通过ARC基准实验验证其安全性。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel framework for developing safe Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI) by combining Active Inference principles with Large Language
Models (LLMs). We argue that traditional approaches to AI safety, focused on
post-hoc interpretability and reward engineering, have fundamental limitations.
We present an architecture where safety guarantees are integrated into the
system's core design through transparent belief representations and
hierarchical value alignment. Our framework leverages natural language as a
medium for representing and manipulating beliefs, enabling direct human
oversight while maintaining computational tractability. The architecture
implements a multi-agent system where agents self-organize according to Active
Inference principles, with preferences and safety constraints flowing through
hierarchical Markov blankets. We outline specific mechanisms for ensuring
safety, including: (1) explicit separation of beliefs and preferences in
natural language, (2) bounded rationality through resource-aware free energy
minimization, and (3) compositional safety through modular agent structures.
The paper concludes with a research agenda centered on the Abstraction and
Reasoning Corpus (ARC) benchmark, proposing experiments to validate our
framework's safety properties. Our approach offers a path toward AGI
development that is inherently safer, rather than retrofitted with safety
measures.

Motivation: 探讨神经网络是否能够表现出类似人类思维的符号系统能力，从而重新思考人类认知过程的本质。

Method: 通过分析现代神经网络的表现，比较其与人类思维在组合想法、产生新颖性和快速学习方面的相似性。

Result: 神经网络展现出类似符号系统的能力，表明人类认知可能不完全依赖符号系统，但符号系统在抽象问题描述中仍起重要作用。

Conclusion: 需要重新研究人类思维的符号基础，提出新的研究议程。

Abstract: Some of the strongest evidence that human minds should be thought about in
terms of symbolic systems has been the way they combine ideas, produce novelty,
and learn quickly. We argue that modern neural networks -- and the artificial
intelligence systems built upon them -- exhibit similar abilities. This
undermines the argument that the cognitive processes and representations used
by human minds are symbolic, although the fact that these neural networks are
typically trained on data generated by symbolic systems illustrates that such
systems play an important role in characterizing the abstract problems that
human minds have to solve. This argument leads us to offer a new agenda for
research on the symbolic basis of human thought.

TL;DR: H-XAI是一个统一的框架，结合因果评分与传统XAI方法，支持交互式、多方法解释过程，满足不同利益相关者的需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有XAI方法主要服务于开发者，缺乏对多样化利益相关者需求的支持，H-XAI旨在填补这一空白。

Method: H-XAI整合因果评分与传统XAI方法，支持利益相关者提问、测试假设，并与随机和偏置基线比较模型行为。

Result: 通过两个案例研究（信用风险分类和金融时间序列预测）验证了H-XAI的通用性。

Conclusion: H-XAI通过结合因果评分和后验解释，填补了现有XAI方法的不足，满足了利益相关者在个体决策和整体模型层面的需求。

Abstract: Current eXplainable AI (XAI) methods largely serve developers, often focusing
on justifying model outputs rather than supporting diverse stakeholder needs. A
recent shift toward Evaluative AI reframes explanation as a tool for hypothesis
testing, but still focuses primarily on operational organizations. We introduce
Holistic-XAI (H-XAI), a unified framework that integrates causal rating methods
with traditional XAI methods to support explanation as an interactive,
multi-method process. H-XAI allows stakeholders to ask a series of questions,
test hypotheses, and compare model behavior against automatically constructed
random and biased baselines. It combines instance-level and global
explanations, adapting to each stakeholder's goals, whether understanding
individual decisions, assessing group-level bias, or evaluating robustness
under perturbations. We demonstrate the generality of our approach through two
case studies spanning six scenarios: binary credit risk classification and
financial time-series forecasting. H-XAI fills critical gaps left by existing
XAI methods by combining causal ratings and post-hoc explanations to answer
stakeholder-specific questions at both the individual decision level and the
overall model level.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance and gain influence, the
development of embodied AI has accelerated, drawing significant attention,
particularly in navigation scenarios. Embodied navigation requires an agent to
perceive, interact with, and adapt to its environment while moving toward a
specified target in unfamiliar settings. However, the integration of embodied
navigation into critical applications raises substantial safety concerns. Given
their deployment in dynamic, real-world environments, ensuring the safety of
such systems is critical. This survey provides a comprehensive analysis of
safety in embodied navigation from multiple perspectives, encompassing attack
strategies, defense mechanisms, and evaluation methodologies. Beyond conducting
a comprehensive examination of existing safety challenges, mitigation
technologies, and various datasets and metrics that assess effectiveness and
robustness, we explore unresolved issues and future research directions in
embodied navigation safety. These include potential attack methods, mitigation
strategies, more reliable evaluation techniques, and the implementation of
verification frameworks. By addressing these critical gaps, this survey aims to
provide valuable insights that can guide future research toward the development
of safer and more reliable embodied navigation systems. Furthermore, the
findings of this study have broader implications for enhancing societal safety
and increasing industrial efficiency.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于知识图谱（KG）的工具检索框架，通过捕捉工具间的语义关系和功能依赖，显著提升了多步任务中的工具检索准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统工具检索方法主要依赖用户查询与工具描述的相似性，难以处理多步用户请求，因此需要一种更全面的检索方法。

Method: 采用知识图谱建模工具间的直接和间接关系，利用1-hop ego工具图的集成算法进行检索。

Result: 在合成数据集上，该方法在Complete Recall指标上达到91.85%的工具覆盖率，优于非KG基线方法的89.26%。

Conclusion: 知识图谱的结构信息为工具检索提供了补充信号，尤其适用于需要顺序工具组合的查询。

Abstract: Effective tool retrieval is essential for AI agents to select from a vast
array of tools when identifying and planning actions in the context of complex
user queries. Despite its central role in planning, this aspect remains
underexplored in the literature. Traditional approaches rely primarily on
similarities between user queries and tool descriptions, which significantly
limits retrieval accuracy, specifically when handling multi-step user requests.
To address these limitations, we propose a Knowledge Graph (KG)-based tool
retrieval framework that captures the semantic relationships between tools and
their functional dependencies. Our retrieval algorithm leverages ensembles of
1-hop ego tool graphs to model direct and indirect connections between tools,
enabling more comprehensive and contextual tool selection for multi-step tasks.
We evaluate our approach on a synthetically generated internal dataset across
six defined user classes, extending previous work on coherent dialogue
synthesis and too retrieval benchmarks. Results demonstrate that our tool
graph-based method achieves 91.85% tool coverage on the micro-average Complete
Recall metric, compared to 89.26% for re-ranked semantic-lexical hybrid
retrieval, the strongest non-KG baseline in our experiments. These findings
support our hypothesis that the structural information in the KG provides
complementary signals to pure similarity matching, particularly for queries
requiring sequential tool composition.

Motivation: 现有多代理研究多限于语言任务，多模态场景下VLM协作能力不足，需解决错误结果放大问题。

Result: 在五个医疗视觉问答基准上验证，协作性能超越单一代理，无需模型训练。

Conclusion: 中介引导的多代理协作可推动医疗多模态智能发展，代码将开源。

Abstract: Complex medical decision-making involves cooperative workflows operated by
different clinicians. Designing AI multi-agent systems can expedite and augment
human-level clinical decision-making. Existing multi-agent researches primarily
focus on language-only tasks, yet their extension to multimodal scenarios
remains challenging. A blind combination of diverse vision-language models
(VLMs) can amplify an erroneous outcome interpretation. VLMs in general are
less capable in instruction following and importantly self-reflection, compared
to large language models (LLMs) of comparable sizes. This disparity largely
constrains VLMs' ability in cooperative workflows. In this study, we propose
MedOrch, a mediator-guided multi-agent collaboration framework for medical
multimodal decision-making. MedOrch employs an LLM-based mediator agent that
enables multiple VLM-based expert agents to exchange and reflect on their
outputs towards collaboration. We utilize multiple open-source general-purpose
and domain-specific VLMs instead of costly GPT-series models, revealing the
strength of heterogeneous models. We show that the collaboration within
distinct VLM-based agents can surpass the capabilities of any individual agent.
We validate our approach on five medical vision question answering benchmarks,
demonstrating superior collaboration performance without model training. Our
findings underscore the value of mediator-guided multi-agent collaboration in
advancing medical multimodal intelligence. Our code will be made publicly
available.

Result: HIMA在战略清晰度、适应性和计算效率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 结合模仿学习和元级协调可开发更鲁棒的通用AI智能体。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive action
sequence prediction capabilities but often struggle with dynamic, long-horizon
tasks such as real-time strategic games. In a game such as StarCraftII (SC2),
agents need to manage resource constraints and adapt to evolving battlefield
situations in a partially observable environment. This often overwhelms
exisiting LLM-based approaches. To address these challenges, we propose a
hierarchical multi-agent framework that employs specialized imitation learning
agents under a meta-controller called Strategic Planner (SP). By expert
demonstrations, each specialized agent learns a distinctive strategy, such as
aerial support or defensive maneuvers, and produces coherent, structured
multistep action sequences. The SP then orchestrates these proposals into a
single, environmentally adaptive plan that ensures local decisions aligning
with long-term strategies. We call this HIMA (Hierarchical Imitation
Multi-Agent). We also present TEXTSCII-ALL, a comprehensive SC2 testbed that
encompasses all race match combinations in SC2. Our empirical results show that
HIMA outperforms state of the arts in strategic clarity, adaptability, and
computational efficiency, underscoring the potential of combining specialized
imitation modules with meta-level orchestration to develop more robust,
general-purpose AI agents.

Motivation: 探索LLM在结构化资源分配任务中的能力，并解决现有评估方法因数据污染和静态基准而受限的问题。

Method: 采用参与式预算（PB）作为框架，通过贪婪选择、直接优化和爬山式细化三种提示策略，测试LLM在预算约束下的项目选择能力，并评估其从自然语言输入中推断偏好的能力。

Result: 结果表明提示设计对LLM性能至关重要，且LLM在非结构化输入的机制设计中具有潜力。

Conclusion: LLM在资源分配和偏好推断任务中表现出潜力，提示设计是关键因素。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to handle complex
decision-making tasks, yet their ability to perform structured resource
allocation remains underexplored. Evaluating their reasoning is also difficult
due to data contamination and the static nature of existing benchmarks. We
present a dual-purpose framework leveraging Participatory Budgeting (PB) both
as (i) a practical setting for LLM-based resource allocation and (ii) an
adaptive benchmark for evaluating their reasoning capabilities. We task LLMs
with selecting project subsets under feasibility (e.g., budget) constraints via
three prompting strategies: greedy selection, direct optimization, and a
hill-climbing-inspired refinement. We benchmark LLMs' allocations against a
utility-maximizing oracle. Interestingly, we also test whether LLMs can infer
structured preferences from natural-language voter input or metadata, without
explicit votes. By comparing allocations based on inferred preferences to those
from ground-truth votes, we evaluate LLMs' ability to extract preferences from
open-ended input. Our results underscore the role of prompt design and show
that LLMs hold promise for mechanism design with unstructured inputs.

Motivation: 认知想象力在人类思维中扮演重要角色，但目前在AI领域被低估，导致AI能力受限。

Method: 提出语义模型，一种基于概率因果关系的数学模型，能够学习和模拟认知想象力。

Result: 语义模型能够确保想象上下文的连贯性，并支持对上下文的透明操作。

Conclusion: 认知想象力是AI发展的潜在突破口，语义模型为实现这一目标提供了可行工具。

Abstract: Cognitive imagination is a type of imagination that plays a key role in human
thinking. It is not a ``picture-in-the-head'' imagination. It is a faculty to
mentally visualize coherent and holistic systems of concepts and causal links
that serve as semantic contexts for reasoning, decision making and prediction.
Our position is that the role of cognitive imagination is still greatly
underestimated, and this creates numerous problems and diminishes the current
capabilities of AI. For instance, when reasoning, humans rely on imaginary
contexts to retrieve background info. They also constantly return to the
context for semantic verification that their reasoning is still reasonable.
Thus, reasoning without imagination is blind. This paper is a call for greater
attention to cognitive imagination as the next promising breakthrough in
artificial intelligence. As an instrument for simulating cognitive imagination,
we propose semantic models -- a new approach to mathematical models that can
learn, like neural networks, and are based on probabilistic causal
relationships. Semantic models can simulate cognitive imagination because they
ensure the consistency of imaginary contexts and implement a glass-box approach
that allows the context to be manipulated as a holistic and coherent system of
interrelated facts glued together with causal relations.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为CA-DL8.5的通用、完整且随时可用的波束搜索算法，用于优化决策树分类误差。该算法扩展了DL8.5框架，统一了现有的随时策略，并通过模块化设计整合了多种启发式和松弛机制。实验表明，基于LDS的CA-DL8.5在随时性能上表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于现有方法在未完成搜索时难以快速找到高质量决策树，且缺乏系统性比较，本文旨在提出一种更有效的随时优化算法。

Method: CA-DL8.5结合了DL8.5的高效剪枝和缓存技术，采用基于重启的波束搜索逐步放宽剪枝标准，提升解的质量。

Result: 实验结果显示，基于LDS的CA-DL8.5在标准分类基准上表现最优，优于其他变体和Blossom算法。

Conclusion: CA-DL8.5提供了一个通用框架，支持多种启发式和搜索策略，同时保持了完整性和最优性保证。

Abstract: Finding an optimal decision tree that minimizes classification error is known
to be NP-hard. While exact algorithms based on MILP, CP, SAT, or dynamic
programming guarantee optimality, they often suffer from poor anytime behavior
-- meaning they struggle to find high-quality decision trees quickly when the
search is stopped before completion -- due to unbalanced search space
exploration. To address this, several anytime extensions of exact methods have
been proposed, such as LDS-DL8.5, Top-k-DL8.5, and Blossom, but they have not
been systematically compared, making it difficult to assess their relative
effectiveness. In this paper, we propose CA-DL8.5, a generic, complete, and
anytime beam search algorithm that extends the DL8.5 framework and unifies some
existing anytime strategies. In particular, CA-DL8.5 generalizes previous
approaches LDS-DL8.5 and Top-k-DL8.5, by allowing the integration of various
heuristics and relaxation mechanisms through a modular design. The algorithm
reuses DL8.5's efficient branch-and-bound pruning and trie-based caching,
combined with a restart-based beam search that gradually relaxes pruning
criteria to improve solution quality over time. Our contributions are twofold:
(1) We introduce this new generic framework for exact and anytime decision tree
learning, enabling the incorporation of diverse heuristics and search
strategies; (2) We conduct a rigorous empirical comparison of several
instantiations of CA-DL8.5 -- based on Purity, Gain, Discrepancy, and Top-k
heuristics -- using an anytime evaluation metric called the primal gap
integral. Experimental results on standard classification benchmarks show that
CA-DL8.5 using LDS (limited discrepancy) consistently provides the best anytime
performance, outperforming both other CA-DL8.5 variants and the Blossom
algorithm while maintaining completeness and optimality guarantees.

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems face significant challenges in perceiving complex
environments and making real-time decisions. Traditional modular approaches,
while offering interpretability, suffer from error propagation and coordination
issues, whereas end-to-end learning systems can simplify the design but face
computational bottlenecks. This paper presents a novel approach to autonomous
driving using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) that integrates bird's-eye view
(BEV) perception for enhanced real-time decision-making. We introduce the
\texttt{Mamba-BEV} model, an efficient spatio-temporal feature extraction
network that combines BEV-based perception with the Mamba framework for
temporal feature modeling. This integration allows the system to encode vehicle
surroundings and road features in a unified coordinate system and accurately
model long-range dependencies. Building on this, we propose the
\texttt{ME$^3$-BEV} framework, which utilizes the \texttt{Mamba-BEV} model as a
feature input for end-to-end DRL, achieving superior performance in dynamic
urban driving scenarios. We further enhance the interpretability of the model
by visualizing high-dimensional features through semantic segmentation,
providing insight into the learned representations. Extensive experiments on
the CARLA simulator demonstrate that \texttt{ME$^3$-BEV} outperforms existing
models across multiple metrics, including collision rate and trajectory
accuracy, offering a promising solution for real-time autonomous driving.

Result: GNN的逻辑表达能力在无向和有向图中均严格超过C2逻辑。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅解决了GNN领域的开问题，还为无穷逻辑的表达能力提供了新见解。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been growing interest in understanding the
expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs) by relating them to logical
languages. This research has been been initialised by an influential result of
Barcel\'o et al. (2020), who showed that the graded modal logic (or a guarded
fragment of the logic C2), characterises the logical expressiveness of
aggregate-combine GNNs. As a ``challenging open problem'' they left the
question whether full C2 characterises the logical expressiveness of
aggregate-combine-readout GNNs. This question has remained unresolved despite
several attempts. In this paper, we solve the above open problem by proving
that the logical expressiveness of aggregate-combine-readout GNNs strictly
exceeds that of C2. This result holds over both undirected and directed graphs.
Beyond its implications for GNNs, our work also leads to purely logical
insights on the expressive power of infinitary logics.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PanelTR框架通过LLM代理科学家实现表格推理，无需数据增强或参数优化，性能优于普通LLM并接近监督模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决表格推理中依赖标注数据或复杂数据增强的问题，提升灵活性和泛化能力。

Method: PanelTR采用结构化科学方法，通过代理科学家进行独立调查、自我审查和同行评审讨论。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，PanelTR表现优于普通LLM，接近监督模型，且无需训练数据。

Conclusion: 结构化科学方法能在零样本情境下有效处理复杂任务，具有灵活的语义理解能力。

Abstract: Table reasoning, including tabular QA and fact verification, often depends on
annotated data or complex data augmentation, limiting flexibility and
generalization. LLMs, despite their versatility, often underperform compared to
simple supervised models. To approach these issues, we introduce PanelTR, a
framework utilizing LLM agent scientists for robust table reasoning through a
structured scientific approach. PanelTR's workflow involves agent scientists
conducting individual investigations, engaging in self-review, and
participating in collaborative peer-review discussions. This process, driven by
five scientist personas, enables semantic-level transfer without relying on
data augmentation or parametric optimization. Experiments across four
benchmarks show that PanelTR outperforms vanilla LLMs and rivals fully
supervised models, all while remaining independent of training data. Our
findings indicate that structured scientific methodology can effectively handle
complex tasks beyond table reasoning with flexible semantic understanding in a
zero-shot context.

*Dewi S. W. Gould,Bruno Mlodozeniec,Samuel F. Brown*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SKATE是一个自动化、可扩展的评估框架，通过让大语言模型（LLMs）相互生成和解决可验证任务来评估其能力，无需人工干预或领域专业知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估方法依赖领域专业知识且难以扩展，无法跟上LLMs的快速发展。

Method: SKATE将评估视为游戏，LLMs既作为任务设定者又作为解决者，生成可验证任务并相互评分。

Result: 实验证明较弱模型能可靠区分更强模型，LLMs表现出自我偏好行为，SKATE能自动揭示模型间的细粒度能力差异。

Conclusion: SKATE为通用、可扩展的评估框架提供了重要进展，能跟上LLMs的发展步伐。

Abstract: Evaluating the capabilities and risks of foundation models is paramount, yet
current methods demand extensive domain expertise, hindering their scalability
as these models rapidly evolve. We introduce SKATE: a novel evaluation
framework in which large language models (LLMs) compete by generating and
solving verifiable tasks for one another. Our core insight is to treat
evaluation as a game: models act as both task-setters and solvers, incentivized
to create questions which highlight their own strengths while exposing others'
weaknesses. SKATE offers several key advantages, balancing scalability,
open-endedness, and objectivity. It is fully automated, data-free, and
scalable, requiring no human input or domain expertise. By using verifiable
tasks rather than LLM judges, scoring is objective. Unlike domain-limited
programmatically-generated benchmarks (e.g. chess-playing or spatial
reasoning), having LLMs creatively pose challenges enables open-ended and
scalable evaluation. As a proof of concept, we introduce LLM-set
code-output-prediction (COP) challenges as a verifiable and extensible
framework in which to test our approach. Using a TrueSkill-based ranking
system, we evaluate six frontier LLMs and find that: (1) weaker models can
reliably differentiate and score stronger ones, (2) LLM-based systems are
capable of self-preferencing behavior, generating questions that align with
their own capabilities, and (3) SKATE automatically surfaces fine-grained
capability differences between models. Our findings are an important step
towards general, scalable evaluation frameworks which can keep pace with LLM
progress.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用机器学习分析车辆路径问题（VRP）解决方案的结构特征，并通过可解释AI理解模型决策，提出统一框架以评估特征重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统元启发式算法依赖人工设计，而机器学习可以更高效地优化VRP解决方案。

Method: 使用多种分类器模型进行敏感性分析，预测VRP解决方案质量，并利用可解释AI分析模型决策。

Result: 特征重要性因模型而异，但某些特征始终是强预测因子；提出统一框架评估特征影响。

Conclusion: 特征重要性分析为开发元启发式算法的指导机制提供了潜在基础。

Abstract: The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a complex optimization problem with
numerous real-world applications, mostly solved using metaheuristic algorithms
due to its $\mathcal{NP}$-Hard nature. Traditionally, these metaheuristics rely
on human-crafted designs developed through empirical studies. However, recent
research shows that machine learning methods can be used the structural
characteristics of solutions in combinatorial optimization, thereby aiding in
designing more efficient algorithms, particularly for solving VRP. Building on
this advancement, this study extends the previous research by conducting a
sensitivity analysis using multiple classifier models that are capable of
predicting the quality of VRP solutions. Hence, by leveraging explainable AI,
this research is able to extend the understanding of how these models make
decisions. Finally, our findings indicate that while feature importance varies,
certain features consistently emerge as strong predictors. Furthermore, we
propose a unified framework able of ranking feature impact across different
scenarios to illustrate this finding. These insights highlight the potential of
feature importance analysis as a foundation for developing a guidance mechanism
of metaheuristic algorithms for solving the VRP.

TL;DR: 研究通过检索增强生成（RAG）框架提升大型语言模型（LLMs）在药物禁忌领域的准确性，显著提高了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在医疗领域的应用，尤其是在药物禁忌这一需要高准确性和可靠性的领域。

Method: 使用OpenAI的GPT-4o-mini作为基础模型，结合text-embedding-3-small模型和Langchain构建混合检索系统，利用公共数据库中的药物使用审查（DUR）数据。

Result: RAG框架显著提升了模型在年龄组、妊娠和联合用药禁忌方面的准确性，分别达到0.94、0.87和0.89。

Conclusion: RAG框架能有效减少药物禁忌决策中的不确定性，提供更精确的信息。

Abstract: The versatility of large language models (LLMs) has been explored across
various sectors, but their application in healthcare poses challenges,
particularly in the domain of pharmaceutical contraindications where accurate
and reliable information is required. This study enhances the capability of
LLMs to address contraindications effectively by implementing a Retrieval
Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. Utilizing OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini as the base
model, and the text-embedding-3-small model for embeddings, our approach
integrates Langchain to orchestrate a hybrid retrieval system with re-ranking.
This system leverages Drug Utilization Review (DUR) data from public databases,
focusing on contraindications for specific age groups, pregnancy, and
concomitant drug use. The dataset includes 300 question-answer pairs across
three categories, with baseline model accuracy ranging from 0.49 to 0.57.
Post-integration of the RAG pipeline, we observed a significant improvement in
model accuracy, achieving rates of 0.94, 0.87, and 0.89 for contraindications
related to age groups, pregnancy, and concomitant drug use, respectively. The
results indicate that augmenting LLMs with a RAG framework can substantially
reduce uncertainty in prescription and drug intake decisions by providing more
precise and reliable drug contraindication information.

Motivation: 现有LLM评估方法过于关注准确性，忽视了置信度校准的重要性，导致实际部署中可靠性不足。

Method: 引入TH-Score量化置信度与准确性的对齐，提出LLM-as-a-Fuser框架，通过集成方法提升评估的可靠性和适应性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著改善了置信度校准，并实现了优于基线的可靠性和准确性。

Conclusion: 置信度驱动的风险感知评估系统是未来LLM评估的关键方向，提出的方法为实际部署提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used as automated judges, where
practical value depends on both accuracy and trustworthy, risk-aware judgments.
Existing approaches predominantly focus on accuracy, overlooking the necessity
of well-calibrated confidence, which is vital for adaptive and reliable
evaluation pipelines. In this work, we advocate a shift from accuracy-centric
evaluation to confidence-driven, risk-aware LLM-as-a-Judge systems, emphasizing
the necessity of well-calibrated confidence for trustworthy and adaptive
evaluation. We systematically identify the **Overconfidence Phenomenon** in
current LLM-as-a-Judges, where predicted confidence significantly overstates
actual correctness, undermining reliability in practical deployment. To
quantify this phenomenon, we introduce **TH-Score**, a novel metric measuring
confidence-accuracy alignment. Furthermore, we propose **LLM-as-a-Fuser**, an
ensemble framework that transforms LLMs into reliable, risk-aware evaluators.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach substantially improves
calibration and enables adaptive, confidence-driven evaluation pipelines,
achieving superior reliability and accuracy compared to existing baselines.

*Yumeng Fu,Jiayin Zhu,Lingling Zhang,Bo Zhao,Shaoxuan Ma,Yushun Zhang,Yanrui Wu,Wenjun Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GeoLaux是一个新的几何问题解决基准，包含2,186个问题，重点评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的长步推理和辅助线构造能力。实验发现MLLMs在长步推理中表现下降，且缺乏辅助线意识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准未充分评估MLLMs的长步推理和辅助线构造能力，因此开发GeoLaux填补这一空白。

Method: 构建包含计算和证明问题的数据集，设计五维评估策略（答案正确性、过程正确性、过程质量、辅助线影响、错误原因）。

Result: 实验显示MLLMs在长步推理中表现显著下降，且在证明问题中倾向于走捷径；辅助线意识的提升对几何推理有显著帮助。

Conclusion: GeoLaux是评估MLLMs长步几何推理能力的有效基准，并为模型能力提升提供指导。

Abstract: Geometry problem solving (GPS) requires models to master diagram
comprehension, logical reasoning, knowledge application, numerical computation,
and auxiliary line construction. This presents a significant challenge for
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, existing benchmarks for
evaluating MLLM geometry skills overlook auxiliary line construction and lack
fine-grained process evaluation, making them insufficient for assessing MLLMs'
long-step reasoning abilities. To bridge these gaps, we present the GeoLaux
benchmark, comprising 2,186 geometry problems, incorporating both calculation
and proving questions. Notably, the problems require an average of 6.51
reasoning steps, with a maximum of 24 steps, and 41.8% of them need auxiliary
line construction. Building on the dataset, we design a novel five-dimensional
evaluation strategy assessing answer correctness, process correctness, process
quality, auxiliary line impact, and error causes. Extensive experiments on 13
leading MLLMs (including thinking models and non-thinking models) yield three
pivotal findings: First, models exhibit substantial performance degradation in
extended reasoning steps (nine models demonstrate over 50% performance drop).
Second, compared to calculation problems, MLLMs tend to take shortcuts when
solving proving problems. Third, models lack auxiliary line awareness, and
enhancing this capability proves particularly beneficial for overall geometry
reasoning improvement. These findings establish GeoLaux as both a benchmark for
evaluating MLLMs' long-step geometric reasoning with auxiliary lines and a
guide for capability advancement. Our dataset and code are included in
supplementary materials and will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 统一概率和逻辑学习是AI领域的关键挑战。

Method: 采用贝叶斯归纳逻辑编程，通过先验和似然平衡假设复杂性和数据拟合。

Result: 在游戏和药物设计等领域的实验中，显著优于最小描述长度程序学习方法，且数据高效、对样本平衡不敏感。

Conclusion: 该方法在统一概率和逻辑学习方面具有优势，适用于多种实际场景。

Abstract: Unifying probabilistic and logical learning is a key challenge in AI. We
introduce a Bayesian inductive logic programming approach that learns minimum
message length programs from noisy data. Our approach balances hypothesis
complexity and data fit through priors, which explicitly favour more general
programs, and a likelihood that favours accurate programs. Our experiments on
several domains, including game playing and drug design, show that our method
significantly outperforms previous methods, notably those that learn minimum
description length programs. Our results also show that our approach is
data-efficient and insensitive to example balance, including the ability to
learn from exclusively positive examples.

Abstract: The goal of inductive logic programming is to search for a hypothesis that
generalises training data and background knowledge. The challenge is searching
vast hypothesis spaces, which is exacerbated because many logically equivalent
hypotheses exist. To address this challenge, we introduce a method to break
symmetries in the hypothesis space. We implement our idea in answer set
programming. Our experiments on multiple domains, including visual reasoning
and game playing, show that our approach can reduce solving times from over an
hour to just 17 seconds.

Elicitation Tool (BET), an AI system performing automated red-teaming through
Dynamic Adversarial Optimization that achieves 100% Attack Success Rate (ASR)
against 37 of 41 state-of-the-art LLMs. Beyond binary success metrics, we
propose a fine-grained robustness metric estimating the average number of
attempts required to elicit harmful behaviors, revealing that attack difficulty
varies by over 300-fold across models despite universal vulnerability. We
introduce primitive-level vulnerability analysis to identify which jailbreaking
techniques are most effective for specific hazard categories. Our collaborative
evaluation with trusted third parties from the AI Safety Network demonstrates
practical pathways for distributed robustness assessment across the community.

TL;DR: 论文重新审视了Conant和Ashby的定理，提出了一种更广义的“信念更新”模型，强调观察者在模型定义中的关键作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨Conant和Ashby定理在更广泛系统中的适用性，解决人工生命等领域中看似无模型的系统问题。

Method: 通过引入“信念更新”的概念，将观察者视角纳入模型定义，提出更广义的定理。

Result: 证明了无论系统是调控环境还是内部状态，观察者均可赋予其环境模型，模型可能简单但有效。

Conclusion: 模型不仅是系统属性，还依赖于观察者视角，为理解无模型系统提供了新框架。

Abstract: In a classic paper, Conant and Ashby claimed that "every good regulator of a
system must be a model of that system." Artificial Life has produced many
examples of systems that perform tasks with apparently no model in sight; these
suggest Conant and Ashby's theorem doesn't easily generalise beyond its
restricted setup. Nevertheless, here we show that a similar intuition can be
fleshed out in a different way: whenever an agent is able to perform a
regulation task, it is possible for an observer to interpret it as having
"beliefs" about its environment, which it "updates" in response to sensory
input. This notion of belief updating provides a notion of model that is more
sophisticated than Conant and Ashby's, as well as a theorem that is more
broadly applicable. However, it necessitates a change in perspective, in that
the observer plays an essential role in the theory: models are not a mere
property of the system but are imposed on it from outside. Our theorem holds
regardless of whether the system is regulating its environment in a classic
control theory setup, or whether it's regulating its own internal state; the
model is of its environment either way. The model might be trivial, however,
and this is how the apparent counterexamples are resolved.

Abstract: Cheating in online video games compromises the integrity of gaming
experiences. Anti-cheat systems, such as VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat), face
significant challenges in keeping pace with evolving cheating methods without
imposing invasive measures on users' systems. This paper presents
AntiCheatPT\_256, a transformer-based machine learning model designed to detect
cheating behaviour in Counter-Strike 2 using gameplay data. To support this, we
introduce and publicly release CS2CD: A labelled dataset of 795 matches. Using
this dataset, 90,707 context windows were created and subsequently augmented to
address class imbalance. The transformer model, trained on these windows,
achieved an accuracy of 89.17\% and an AUC of 93.36\% on an unaugmented test
set. This approach emphasizes reproducibility and real-world applicability,
offering a robust baseline for future research in data-driven cheat detection.

Conclusion: 论文确立了以用户为中心的解释性AI研究议程，强调跨领域和文化背景的应用需求。

Abstract: Current explainable AI (XAI) approaches prioritize algorithmic transparency
and present explanations in abstract, non-adaptive formats that often fail to
support meaningful end-user understanding. This paper introduces "Explanatory
AI" as a complementary paradigm that leverages generative AI capabilities to
serve as explanatory partners for human understanding rather than providers of
algorithmic transparency. While XAI reveals algorithmic decision processes for
model validation, Explanatory AI addresses contextual reasoning to support
human decision-making in sociotechnical contexts. We develop a definition and
systematic eight-dimensional conceptual model distinguishing Explanatory AI
through narrative communication, adaptive personalization, and progressive
disclosure principles. Empirical validation through Rapid Contextual Design
methodology with healthcare professionals demonstrates that users consistently
prefer context-sensitive, multimodal explanations over technical transparency.
Our findings reveal the practical urgency for AI systems designed for human
comprehension rather than algorithmic introspection, establishing a
comprehensive research agenda for advancing user-centered AI explanation
approaches across diverse domains and cultural contexts.

Motivation: 法律决策需要全面的法律背景知识和最新案例信息，但法律领域的KG较少。本文旨在开发针对女性暴力案件的法律KG，提升法律信息的可访问性和机器学习应用。

Method: 采用两种互补方法：系统化的自下而上方法（针对法律领域定制）和基于大语言模型的新方案。从欧洲法院公开判决中提取数据，结合结构化数据提取、本体开发和语义增强构建KG。

Result: 开发的法律KG通过能力问题验证，可用于提升法律信息访问、支持复杂查询和机器学习工具。

Conclusion: 构建的法律KG对提升法律信息可访问性和支持预测性司法具有重要价值。

Abstract: Legal decision-making process requires the availability of comprehensive and
detailed legislative background knowledge and up-to-date information on legal
cases and related sentences/decisions. Legal Knowledge Graphs (KGs) would be a
valuable tool to facilitate access to legal information, to be queried and
exploited for the purpose, and to enable advanced reasoning and machine
learning applications. Indeed, legal KGs may act as knowledge intensive
component to be used by pre-dictive machine learning solutions supporting the
decision process of the legal expert. Nevertheless, a few KGs can be found in
the legal domain. To fill this gap, we developed a legal KG targeting legal
cases of violence against women, along with clear adopted methodologies.
Specifically, the paper introduces two complementary approaches for automated
legal KG construction; a systematic bottom-up approach, customized for the
legal domain, and a new solution leveraging Large Language Models. Starting
from legal sentences publicly available from the European Court of Justice, the
solutions integrate structured data extraction, ontology development, and
semantic enrichment to produce KGs tailored for legal cases involving violence
against women. After analyzing and comparing the results of the two approaches,
the developed KGs are validated via suitable competency questions. The obtained
KG may be impactful for multiple purposes: can improve the accessibility to
legal information both to humans and machine, can enable complex queries and
may constitute an important knowledge component to be possibly exploited by
machine learning tools tailored for predictive justice.

Motivation: 现有公平机器学习的定义多为观察性，且常相互冲突，无法适应动态社会环境，因此需要一种动态机制来保证公平性。

Method: 提出“Fair Game”框架，将审计员和去偏算法通过强化学习循环结合，动态调整公平性目标。

Result: “Fair Game”能够灵活适应社会伦理和法律框架的变化，为公平机器学习提供动态解决方案。

Conclusion: “Fair Game”为公平机器学习提供了一种动态、灵活的框架，适用于算法部署前后的公平性保障。

Abstract: An emerging field of AI, namely Fair Machine Learning (ML), aims to quantify
different types of bias (also known as unfairness) exhibited in the predictions
of ML algorithms, and to design new algorithms to mitigate them. Often, the
definitions of bias used in the literature are observational, i.e. they use the
input and output of a pre-trained algorithm to quantify a bias under concern.
In reality,these definitions are often conflicting in nature and can only be
deployed if either the ground truth is known or only in retrospect after
deploying the algorithm. Thus,there is a gap between what we want Fair ML to
achieve and what it does in a dynamic social environment. Hence, we propose an
alternative dynamic mechanism,"Fair Game",to assure fairness in the predictions
of an ML algorithm and to adapt its predictions as the society interacts with
the algorithm over time. "Fair Game" puts together an Auditor and a Debiasing
algorithm in a loop around an ML algorithm. The "Fair Game" puts these two
components in a loop by leveraging Reinforcement Learning (RL). RL algorithms
interact with an environment to take decisions, which yields new observations
(also known as data/feedback) from the environment and in turn, adapts future
decisions. RL is already used in algorithms with pre-fixed long-term fairness
goals. "Fair Game" provides a unique framework where the fairness goals can be
adapted over time by only modifying the auditor and the different biases it
quantifies. Thus,"Fair Game" aims to simulate the evolution of ethical and
legal frameworks in the society by creating an auditor which sends feedback to
a debiasing algorithm deployed around an ML system. This allows us to develop a
flexible and adaptive-over-time framework to build Fair ML systems pre- and
post-deployment.

Motivation: 研究多赢家投票规则在不同偏好分布下的公理表现，以数据驱动方式补充最坏情况分析的不足。

Method: 提出数据驱动框架，分析投票规则与公理表现的关系，并引入神经网络作为投票规则。

Result: 神经网络投票规则在减少公理违反方面优于传统规则。

Conclusion: 数据驱动方法可为新投票系统设计提供参考，推动社会选择领域的数据驱动研究。

Abstract: Committee-selection problems arise in many contexts and applications, and
there has been increasing interest within the social choice research community
on identifying which properties are satisfied by different multi-winner voting
rules. In this work, we propose a data-driven framework to evaluate how
frequently voting rules violate axioms across diverse preference distributions
in practice, shifting away from the binary perspective of axiom satisfaction
given by worst-case analysis. Using this framework, we analyze the relationship
between multi-winner voting rules and their axiomatic performance under several
preference distributions. We then show that neural networks, acting as voting
rules, can outperform traditional rules in minimizing axiom violations. Our
results suggest that data-driven approaches to social choice can inform the
design of new voting systems and support the continuation of data-driven
research in social choice.
